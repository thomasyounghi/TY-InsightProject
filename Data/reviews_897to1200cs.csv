I decided to buy 2 beef patties. They were already heated thanks to the case they put it in.

The beef patties were soft. The dough was good, soft and a bit flaky and moist. I had wished I asked if they had hot sauce."
897,7-eleven-new-york-49,2019-04-08,1.0,"Hi,
On last Wednesday I purchased a Google Play gift card from following 7-Eleven below for $500, because they told me gift cards could not be purchased with a debit card. No one stated to me that gift was non-refundable even it was unused. Less then 2 hours late I returned the store to return it, because I didn't need it for what i initially purchased it for. I was told I needed to contact Google customer service and I did. Google customer service stated to me that the 7-eleven was responsible for issuing my refund. I returned to the and explained what Google customer service told me and the employees of that particular 7-eleven store told me to return in the morning at 9:00 a.m on Thursday. I returned the following morning and the owner of the store still wasn't there and they told me to call back at 10:00 a.m.. I called back at the suggested time and the owner still was not there and I left my name and number with the employees and manager. A full day passed and I returned to the store again, because I still did not receive an answer. I then called customer service and now you guys have informed me 4 days later that these gifts cards aren't refundable, but legally that is a breach, because no one in 7-eleven customer service or this particular store informed me that it would not be refundable. It is a $500 gift card that I have not used and I would like my refund. This is not the right way to treat your loyal customers."
897,7-eleven-new-york-49,2017-09-16,1.0,I went to the store to get a big bite hotdog. I asked him if it came with a drink or not then he pointed me to the onion and sauce area.  He doesn't know English at all.
897,7-eleven-new-york-49,2016-06-13,1.0,"There was little to no help. Everything was overpriced. I had a free coffee on my 7-Eleven app they checked off my free coffee and then had no coffee in the store and refused to make any. After that I found that a company called Jesus was advertising for $1 e-cigarettes, plus tax. From where I live, I looked up the closest 711 that complied with the offer. I walk 10 blocks to the 7-Eleven as it was the only one that complied with the offer, they rang up the two Vuse e-cigarettes and proceeded to charge me $25. I showed them the app, and they acted like they agreed with me and not in heads murmuring and speaking their foreign tongue. Which also was extremely rude. They once again rang up the two items and took a  single dollar off and told me I was very lucky that they were ""working with me"".  with the drinks that I had to pay for despite them using my ""buy 6 cups, get 7th free""  and a single cookie, the total came to $7 for a cookie and slurpee. When I asked why, he made up an excuse that was unintelligible and demanded FULL payment. I put their products back and left. This store is ridiculous and willing to rip off their neighbors.
DO NOT GO HERE. Walk the extra block to the NEXT 711 and save yourself the hassle of adding your purchase- down to the penny and check their stock before letting them scan your phone. Even 711s in NJ would put a save coffee pot on for a customer, coupon or not. These 2 men, working the night of JUNE 13, 2016 were lazy, rude, and a detriment to this store
 Myself, family and friends will NEVER RETURN. They're thieves."

898,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-11,2019-09-14,5.0,"Don't understand why the reviews are bad.. This cafe serves its purpose. The manager here is awesome, the barista is really fast and I never have to wait more than a minute for my coffee during rush hours. They also have trendy coffee menu like lavender, rose, matcha oat, which I was only able to see in Asian countries and certain asian cafes in lower side of Manhattan. And they taste awesome! The toasts are good but just keep in mind they are small and a bit expensive. But I definitely recommend their specialty coffee and latte. It's a lot better than other chain coffee chains and carry their own uniqueness."
898,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-11,2019-06-17,2.0,"I happen to be walking by this morning a young man was outside handing out free samples of iced coffee. I'm not an iced coffee drinker but, I came inside anyway. The cashier was polite. They did have a leak in the ceiling and it was dripping in the middle of the shop. They appeared to be cleaning it up. 

 I ordered the seasonal Dulce de leche latte with oat milk. I was shocked that the oat milk/ coconut milk was an additional $1.00. Which is more than what Starbucks cost for non-dairy milk. Unfortunately, the latte was subpar in taste. I could only taste the oat milk. Dulce de leche has a distinct taste and flavor. I did not receive any of that taste in this latte. I truly feel like I wasted $6.  

They do serve breakfast foods and pastries. I am not sure if there doughnuts are from Dough but, they do look alike. 

I am not sure if I would go back."
898,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-11,2019-10-15,2.0,Had a craving for a pumpkin spice latte so I stepped out of work and decide to try le cafe. Paid $6 for a small PSL with oat milk. I get it that this is steps from Times Square so it's tourist prices but the up charge for non-dairy is so behind the times.

898,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-11,2019-06-28,1.0,"This place is a huge ripoff. The owners of this cafe MUST be brave, the way they overcharge. I'll never go here again. After paying 7.50 for a rose matcha latte (it would have been 8 because half and half is extra ), I thought, I'll just stick to the food. That's gotta be a better deal. NOPE. Avoid. You'll feel terrible when you eat what you've bought and are still hungry."

900,dunkin-new-york-60,2016-02-15,5.0,"This Dunkin Donut shop on 10th & 37th Street is one of the finest food shops in Manhattan.  I live the wonderful  & varied MENUE they have and the WONDERFUL FOREIGN WORKERS who work at this particular Dunkin Donut shop.

These foreign workers are such good workers because they are so attentive, so respectful, and so very cheerful.  IT IS SUCH A JOY TO PURCHASE FOOD & BEVERAGE PURCHASES AT THIS DD SHOP. 

I am not trying to make light of American workers because they are terrific too.  However I am mentioning this particular place because ALL THE WORKERS ARE FOREIGN & ALL THE WORKERS ARE HARD WORKING IMMIGRANTS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.

900,dunkin-new-york-60,2015-07-05,1.0,"Ask for a receipt and count your change. This place shortchanges you.

I bought 3 bags of ice for a house party yesterday. The staff told me the total was $8.30. I fished out a quarter and a nickel ($0.30) and handed them to him along with a 10 dollar bill. He took a moment looking at the coins before putting them away and giving me back $2. I asked for a receipt. Again the staff hesitated. I asked a second time before the staff reluctantly gave me the receipt. I looked at the receipt as I walked towards the door and saw that the total was $8.13, and that the staff entered that I gave him $10.13 to generate the $2 change. I looked at him but was completely ignored by him. I wasn't about to confront him over 17 cents but COME ON, he totally knew what he was doing. 17 cents is not a big deal, but I don't like it when a store takes advantage of their customers as part of their business practice. Won't go back."
900,dunkin-new-york-60,2018-07-07,2.0,"The sign said ""2 iced coffees for $4"". I only wanted one and was charged $3.19. What a rip off! Always disappointed when I visit. Most times there is no decaf so I just leave. It's a DD in a gas station, so my expectations are not very high to begin with. Go if you must, but there are better options within 50 feet!"
900,dunkin-new-york-60,2014-09-25,2.0,"Why did I do this to myself? (Because it was nearby and it was open, that's why. I needed something in my stomach.)

Heavy, bland, produced without an ounce of love - America runs on mediocrity. All that I could have handled, though, if some of them hadn't been super stale. The only thing saving this from a single star rating was the friendly cashier and the freshness of some of the other doughnuts."
900,dunkin-new-york-60,2015-12-19,1.0,"Do NOT go to this so-called shop. This place does NOT define #AmericaRunsOnDunkin.  It is the PUREST definition of incompetence and filth I have ever seen.  Incompetent management that allows employees to cook & serve food bare handed, no hats.  Rude service and the orders ALWAYS come out wrong. I've contacted the franchisee several times.  He could care less as they've yet to fix anything and they continue to ignore the health code.  #AmericaRunsOnRude. You will get sick."
900,dunkin-new-york-60,2016-10-20,1.0,"This is the worst DD...probably in the world. The people barely speak English, the food is stale and they don't even know how to make the items on the menu. What is going on here? The whole point of going to a franchise is to get what I know I want at the quality I expect. This place is a disaster. Why do we only have one Dairy Queen in Manhattan!!!"
900,dunkin-new-york-60,2011-03-30,4.0,Nice people working the counter they gave me a free coffee for messing up my order. Very friendly
901,bandit-coffee-new-york-4,2020-03-15,4.0,"I've seen people handing out coupon for Bandit in front of the store for the past few weeks. I finally decided to go since it's actually the closest coffee shop to the office. The barista kindly explained how it works - you can order at the coffee shop by using the tablets set there, or order in advance through the app. You benefit from additional deals depending on time of the day if you order through the app. 

I'm not sure if the drinks are priced the same if you order with the app or the tablet, but latte is only $2 if ordered through the app, a price you never see anywhere in the city. TBH latte tasted okay but not that great, but I'm willing to go back and give it another try. The waffles looked good so I want to try that too sometime else.

Bandit is also very spacious and there are many seats available (plus free wi-fi!), which makes it a great location to work or chill for a while. I just hope this location survives the competition for a long haul."
903,amy-s-bread-at-nypl-new-york,2019-11-15,3.0,"Amy's would have been a Five Star experience. The one employee was working her tail off. She was friendly. My salad was Delicious!   

I'm taking off a star because the table was dirty. The tray on the table is glued to the top of the table making it impossible to clean inside and around. 

I'm taking off one star because they didn't have any forks. Come on! I'm eating a salad. 

I highly recommend the Quinoa  Salad. With tax it's $10.07 and comes with a Sourdough Roll. I didn't care for the Roll at all. Doughy with a tough crust. 

It was a filling lunch while in the library. I am not sure if I would eat there again. I go by my hunger and time to eat. I was hungry today! You check it out and decide."
903,amy-s-bread-at-nypl-new-york,2019-05-10,4.0,"Libraries and snacks don't go usually together but at this library/landmark's ground floor is a small cafe that has a fun variety of pastries. (The coffee they serve here is strong. I drink my coffee black, always, and found it to be very bitter.)

Anyhow, I was compelled to review this place thanks to their pistachio croissant twist, which was on the sweeter side but quite delicious-a perfect pick me up for a day without caffeine. 

Kudos to the patient cashiers working here- tourists can be so stubborn and frustrating. 

I'd love to know who Amy is so I can ask her for the recipe to now, one of my favorite dessert pastries! :)"
903,amy-s-bread-at-nypl-new-york,2020-01-03,1.0,"Epic fail for this Amy's concession at the 5th Avenue branch of the NYPL. I brought an out of town guest to see the Salinger exhibit and thought it would be nice to have coffee and a pastry before queuing up. Showed up around 3:45, perfect coffee hour and was told there was no coffee left, just tea. The only pastries were one black and white cookie and some kind of twisty thing with sesame seeds. Asked the counter person how long before fresh coffee would be available and he responded with an extremely impatient tone that the wait was 40 minutes. As if I was inconveniencing him by inquiring! Settled for tea and the last cookie. Tables were filthy. Service abominable. How do you call yourself a cafe and not have coffee and pastries during the holiday season and hold a concession in a landmark attraction in NYC with a hugely popular exhibition on view? Amateurish and sloppy. Fail. Sorry Amy's, used to frequent your spot on 9th but the quality has really gone down there as well. Bought some croissants a few months ago and they were mushy like boxed, not flaky. Get it together or please get out of the NYPL and let someone who cares have the concession. Oh, and that last black and white cookie was stale. Should have known."
904,dunkin-new-york-52,2019-08-16,5.0,"LOVE having this DD right underneath the WeWork. My current go to is an iced caramel latte with almond milk. Yes, they may be 648295739 calories but they are SO GOOD. The other day my coworker literally said: ""this morning I woke up really happy and then as soon as I got on the train and took a sip of my DD iced coffee I was on CLOUD NINE"" 

Food wise I enjoy the power breakfast sandwich and this morning saw they added a vegan option with Beyond Meat.

The are super efficient in that the line moves fast, and your order is ready fast. You can also order online for pickup. They have lots of seating for being a small location, plus charging ports (I think they might even have actual chargers?). 

Only complaints: 1) they should be using compostable straws or those sippy lids where straws aren't necessary; and 2) I wish this was the location that was giving out free pumpkin drinks and lip balm last week!!"
904,dunkin-new-york-52,2019-08-13,1.0,"The manager/employee of this Dunkin' constantly yells at costumers that we didn't hear her number, but if about 4 people just stood there in front of you telling you ""you have been calling different numbers"" perhaps you called a different number. This has happened 4 different occasion with the same woman who wears a Dunkin hat. She yells out ""321"" and then asked you what you number is (455) and then yells at you that she has been calling that number. Uhhh lady, you have not been telling 455. Stop telling people have you been telling our numbers when you have not."
905,birch-coffee-new-york-19,2020-03-10,4.0,"THEY INTRODUCED ME TO HEMP SEED MILK

New fav for this week is the Birch Coffee located instead on the 5 Bryant Park building. They are literally around the corner from my job. Super convenient when you have an early morning wake up call. 

I have been there twice already. One of there associates came by with a Hi Neighbor Card for everyone at my job so I was able to try them for free. First time around I got Chai Latte with Oat milk. For me the Oat milk was a bit too strong. It's literally like drinking oatmeal, which freaked me out a bit! The second time I went I got Hemp Seed Milk which tasted so much better. 

Right now I am taking out bread, grains and dairy from my dietary plan so I'm glad I found an alternative. They do not have almond milk which is a bummer. It is also the reason why I had to change my order up. I'm use to replacing all my teas or lattes with almond milk. So when they said they didn't have any, I was shock. Finding an alternative is annoying but they made it easy by allowing me to taste the varieties before hand. 

That is really good especially when your skeptical to something that is routine for you. Overall it is a good. You have to however remember it's located in 5 Bryant Park building if not you will walk right past it. It's convenient for me but may be a headache to others. So just be mindful."
906,7-eleven-new-york-85,2019-07-06,4.0,"This is one of the two frequent stop for us during our trip in NY.  They had everything we needed from milk, juice, salads, packed fresh fruits, and many more.  Prices are decent, especially right in the center of Manhattan.  There were few homeless people in front of the store, but they were peaceful, non aggressive.  Service was quick though crowded, their employees were nice and helpful.  We were glad that this store existed near our hotel."
906,7-eleven-new-york-85,2018-10-05,3.0,Stopped here to grab a drink before heading back to the train after taking a trip with my buddy. This 7-11 location is well kept and very busy. Their hot food selection seems to be well stocked and fresher then some of the other locations I have been too. They even have a nice souvenir section as well which makes for a quick gift for someone if on the go. Overall a good experience.
907,dunkin-new-york-44,2018-08-28,3.0,"I came here this morning for a quick cup of coffee. I was immediately greeted once I made my way up to the cashier. I asked the cashier if they had all of the seasonal pumpkin syrups available and she told me yes. I am very excited to have anything pumpkin flavored. 

Unfortunately, this cup of coffee with pumpkin syrup let me down big time. The dark roast coffee was very watered down and did not satisfy my coffee craving. I was very disappointed in my coffee experience here. But, I had already made it back to my desk by the time I actual tasted it. 

Overall, I am not in any hurry to come back for coffee."
907,dunkin-new-york-44,2019-10-06,1.0,"Terrible service, went in today with my daughter, there was a lady before her who had ordered bacon egg and cheese on a croissants, the guy behind the counter then took my daughter's order for a plain bagel. He repeated her order back to her and literally confirmed a plain bagel. Then we waited and waited and waited, the lady who ordered before us started to get angry and asked where her order was. The guy told her that he was sorry he charged her for croissants when they actually didn't have any, if she could just have her bacon egg and cheese on a plain bagel instead. The lady lost her temper, and said she needed to leave so to just give her the order on a plain bagel so she could get out of there. We were still waiting for our plain bagel for about 10 minutes at this point too, but I didn't wanted to get involved, I thought ""let him take care of her she's angry and then we'll get our bagel so we can leave too."" The lady before us got her order on a plain bagel and she stormed off. Then he hands us a closed bag and says here's your order, so we leave with it. A block away my daughter opens it to find an everything bagel. So we think ""okay this is just a mistake let's go back and get your plain bagel."" When we get there he says that he had to give the last plain bagel to the angry lady, so we need to just take the everything bagel. This is where I now started to get angry. I said no that's not right because we ordered something, he confirmed it and then we waited so long to just get something else. He said the lady ordered before you so she gets the plain bagel. Which is so illogical because she never ordered a plain bagel to begin with, she wanted her order on a croissant, he messed up and should have owned up to it, not given away the bagel we payed for. This is absurd, he wasted so much of our time. He said that he couldn't refund us without the receipt, then made us fish through the trash to find our receipt to prove that we had in fact order a plain bagel to get refunded. While we were literally looking through garbage he accused my daughter of lying about her order on top of that, saying she said she wanted an everything bagel, which is ridiculous because she would never eat an everything bagel. I just wanted my money back so I literally looked through the trash to find my receipt, which I did and he refunded me $2.69 and had this attitude of ""there, now get out."" 

I would have left it at that, but now I am going to make sure that his superior hear of this. He wasted so much of our time and making me look through the trash was disgusting on his part."

909,on-off-coffee-new-york,2013-11-15,4.0,"This morning while stumbling around Midtown East, I wandered inside Urban Outfitters to see what was new for the holidays. I really love this location, two floors of awesome hipster gear to browse through. 

While going up to the second floor, on the landing between the first and second floor, there is a cafe! So cool to see a coffee bar inside UO. I was in the mood for a cup of coffee, and ordered a small soy latte. The guy behind the counter was really nice and helpful. He told me that this is a new coffee bar and it has been at this location for about a month. He also stated that UO is trying to move in the direction of having a store, gallery and coffee shop all rolled into one. Seems like a lot of businesses moving in this direction these days. One stop shop for everything! 

They source their coffee from Kickapoo Coffee Roasters based out of Wisconsin. They also have some pastries on hand from Balthazar Bakery. The coffee was well-made, no burnt taste. I am getting better now and identifying good coffee, I guess it just takes practise. 

My only gripe about this coffee bar is that there is no seating. So you just get your coffee and wander around the store. You could always sit under the stairs in the store, but it just isn't the same. 

Right now, this is the only coffee bar open inside UO, but they are planning to open more coffee bars inside other UOs in the city. Keep your eyes peeled."

In an area suddenly rife with impressive brew options, Konditori is looking to stand out with more diverse food options than your average space-strapped midtown cafe. 

I wasn't terribly hungry, so just got a cortado (solid, not extraordinary) and a quite good cheddar chive biscuit. However, I'll certainly be coming back for breakfast/lunch soon, what with their impressive breakfast taco menu and bagel sandwich or bagel & Swedish lox options. 

They've done an impressive job with the space itself--crafty and efficient, those Scandinavians. Decent amount of seating in a clean, stark environment, and free wi-fi to boot. In brief, Good coffee, and can't wait to try some breakfast with that coffee."

It is more expensive and definitely not worth putting up with the rudeness. It just starts your day bad when you just want to have a nice cup of Joe.

I think the crummy muffin was the ""last straw"" after 15 or 20 visits with poor service. I would call the service disinterested and unmotivated more than rude. There's one employee who for whatever reason just doesn't seem to feel like actually taking the order.  The service and coffee and meal prep is slow and unorganized and I think the system could just work a little better, having watched them communicate the orders.   Strangely the signage is quite poor - there's still an Oren's sign outside the entrance and only when you get in are there small signs indicating that it's a Konditori. There's a refrigeration system with food placed in the worst space right at the entrance."

Hotel Penn advertises  City Perk as a restaurant.  It's not!
It's just a run down ghetto dirty mini coffee shop.  

Nothing but coffee, rolls and orange drink. No eggs, cereal or toast .  Health department should shut them down.

Their ""breakfast "" is nasty tasting orange drink, (not orange juice) stale rolls and coffee.  They don't even have a microwave to heat the rolls. 

When I asked for a small cup of ice for my orange drink, they said it's $1.00 !  I said no, anywhere else, ice is built into the price of the juice.  He then spoke a foreign language to his co-workers who then looked at me and laughed.  He was a total a hole. 

They are a ""One and Done"" shop, not caring if you return as a repeat customer. Horrible attitude. 

On my way out, a mouse ran in front of me heading for an open box of rolls they had on the floor.  

Yuck."

I waited approximately 25 minutes to order multiple drinks, waited another 10 minutes for the drinks to be made, to realize they made a mistake on one drink. 

Instead of fixing my drink order, I had to get back into line and reorder my drink in order to get a new one.

914,jacks-stir-brew-coffee-new-york-16,2019-03-17,4.0,"We were wandering around Hudson Yards shops before climbing the Vessel.  It was a cold windy day, and I needed to perk up.  I was thinking, ""A hot chocolate, coffee, or espresso would be nice right about now.""

We walked by several places where I could have had a typical coffee or latte, but I passed.  Then, we came across Jack's Stir Brew Coffee with a large sign, ""Jack's Barista's Choice: Mayan Mocha,"" which was described as a classic latte infused with cocoa, nutmeg, and cayenne!  Reading the sign alone perked me up, and I asked the representative to tell me more.  She told me that the default is to make it with oat milk.  I wanted to try it exactly how it is normally served.  My curiosity was peaked; it sounded like exactly what I needed.

The barista, who seemed to take real care to make each drink, made my Mayan Mocha look beautiful, and it hit the right spot for a cold day.  It was as you might expect:  a cross between a frothy latte and light hot chocolate (not the very thick rich kind) with the cayenne leaving a mild burn in the back of the throat.  It was mildly sweet.  Two problems:  1) The 10 oz serving was gone in less than 5 minutes because it was so wonderful, and went down too easily as it was light/frothy and not very hot; and 2) It was pricy at ~$9 (including tax and small tip).  Thankfully, we don't live near one of the Jack's Stir Brew Coffee locations since I would be frequently tempted and my bank account could suffer.

Well done drinks, nicely presented, friendly and efficient staff."
914,jacks-stir-brew-coffee-new-york-16,2019-11-20,2.0,"Not impressed. Despite the fact that the store was totally quiet on a recent weekend afternoon, the three staffers here forgot about my order until I had to remind them about it.

A large Mountie - a maple cinnamon mocha - had little of either flavor and wasn't worth the $7 price tag. Should have stuck to a simple americano.

Boo hoo. There's a Blue Bottle outlet here at the Hudson Yards shops which I didn't visit, but since I'm from the Bay Area where it's based, I can vouch for how dependable it is. Should have gone there instead of trying someplace new."

914,jacks-stir-brew-coffee-new-york-16,2019-03-17,5.0,"This is a GREAT PLACE!!! I was at the grand opening of Hudson Yards and was familiar with Jack's as they have 10 locations in New York City and Eastern Long Island. This is a great space and I was drawn in by everything it has to offer. Besides the outstanding customer service and attention to detail the coffee, tea and vegan baked goods are PHENOMENAL!! Any location I've been to is clean and has a friendly staff so they are consistent. 

Jack's offers high quality organic, shade grown coffee and you can purchase the coffee beans by the pound to take home and continue to enjoy the experience. Jack himself was on hand to meet and greet the customers and you can see his passion for the business. The owner really cares and looks like he will  do what it takes to support his employees and customers. It's great to support a locally owned business and not an 800 pound Gorilla in the business like Starbuck's. 

Their prices are very fair and more importantly they offer a very healthy alternative with vegan products.You can even get oatmeal and all kinds of delicious add ons like bananas and honey.  You can taste the quality and freshness of everything they have. I would highly recommend you try any of their locations if you can't make Hudson Yards. They have near by locations in Chelsea, the Seaport, the Upper East Side and lower Manhattan like the West Village and Meatpacking district."

Liked the donut so came back here just two days later (Friday at 7:10pm).  There were two female employees just chit chatting so I asked if they still had the 50% baked goods after 7p.  She said ""not at this location"" with an attitude and then resumed her conversation with a friend or coworker.  Service: 0 stars.  Will not be back until they improve their staff and attitude.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: 4-stars
Tried their apple cider donut - very good.  Prices on baked goods chopped 50% after 7p - so $2 for the donut was worth it.  Don't think I'd drop the normal price of $4.15 for it"

This happened today.

Not sure why they would that here. Its rarely busy enough in this location to treat returning customers like this. 

I was skipped by this lady wearing a KISS t-shirt. Not even in uniform. I looked at the man she was helping, then just was going to wait because I'm not a rude racist person like Jack's employs. Then another lady came to ask if I had been helped so at least we know not everyone here is racist.

I'm surprised that you guys would let an employee wear a rock concert t shirt and work your cash registers, let alone hire a racist person that blatantly skips someone at the front of the line like they are below them and they can't take their order.

Edit: I want to also say the barista making my drinks apologized for her coworkers racist actions. She said it was wrong and sorry. Very nice of her. But the girl with the KISS t-shrit...you are a terrible human being."

917,alidoro-new-york-6,2020-03-07,3.0,"I've been hearing a lot of people praise this place but I never went about going. Tbh I couldn't make up my mind when looking at the menu. 
Just realized last week that alidoro is available on meal pal. Perfect I didn't have to think what to eat. 

When I got it the meal was Alidoro sandwich. That ought to be legit to have the same name as the place. 

I had a friend who had Alidoro, not sure which one, but she kept on saying how it's so spicy. That made me cautious when eating because mine specifically mentioned hot peppers. 

The Alidoro sandwich has prosciutto, hot peppers, sweet roasted peppers, mushroom paste, fennel, hot spread, arugula 

First of all I gotta say the size of this sandwich lives up to its (original) price. 

The bread is a bit stiff on the outside but not too bad. 

Between hot and sweet peppers I couldn't tell what is what. They're all kinda mixed together in a mash which is interesting to taste hotness when not expected. 
Idk what the hot spread is actually. But there is some sort of hotness within this sandwich. It's not as bad as what my friend said but there is an obvious heat. 

Fennel.... Is that even in there? 

Arugula. I like it there. 

Prosciutto. Okay i gotta say I was never a fan but I decided after this sandwich that I don't like prosciutto. I don't think it's Alidoro's fault. The intactness of prosciutto plus the thickness of the sandwich plus the stiffness of the bread made this a messy sandwich to eat. Not a fan.  

As a sandwich place I think it's aight but for various reasons I don't think I'll come again myself."

They opened at the most perfect time of year, and will be able to make a year's worth of sales alone from Italian tourists visiting to the see the Christmas Tree right upstairs.

After a few meetings and thinking it over, I decided to walk back and get the mozz. I went to the counter with my sandwich (that I took one bite out of) and asked them to add the mozz and heat it up. They did just that and said their computers were down so they couldn't refund me. They gave me back my sandwich, with mozz but forgot the other half. I lost an hour of my day, half a sandwich, and to be honest, they were not nice about it. I'll go back because they make a dam good sandwich but will check they got it right before I leave."

Their cream puff are big (like the size of 2 baseballs combined together) with a very smooth cream filling and has a crunchy outer layer on the top. The ooze though *licks* Or you can grab a knife and cut in half.

I really had to stop myself from ordering 5693874653 items because it was the cutest bakery I have ever seen and everything sounded/looked so good! The store itself is also really aesthetically pleasing, but there's limited seating and it errs on the cozy side. Prices are a little high but are arguably justified by the creativity, quality and uniqueness of the products.

I tried the everything croissant, earl grey panna cotta, matcha white chocolate cream puff, earl grey vanilla cream puff, and a matcha latte. I'm a sucker for everything bagels and croissants, so combining the two together was a bit of a dream come true. The panna cotta was light and tasty with subtle hints of earl grey. The matcha cream puff was solid and tasted exactly as it sounds like. I was really excited about the earl grey cream puff, but it tasted quite sour...I wasn't sure if that's just how it was supposed to taste because it's tea-based, but I was a little disappointed. The matcha latte was fragrant and good, but also wasn't an exceptional drink (might also have some bias coming from Orange County). 

Overall am absolutely down to continue to stop by Bibble & Sip if I'm ever in town to try as many more pastries as I possibly can."

As I walked in I saw lots of pastries on top of - and behind - the counter. They also had traditional breakfast offerings such as banana bread, scones, and quiche, as well as more unique items like English or Florentine muffin sliders, jalapeño cheddar cornbread, and milk tea cloud cake. Bibble and Sip also had a whole range of hot and cold beverages and desserts - matcha lemon cheesecake, yuzu vanilla fruit tart, cream puffs, and black sesame hazelnut tart.

I tried the spiced pear scone and earl grey panna cotta. The scone was firm and crunchy, a little harder that I usually like scones, but the flavor was there. The panna cotta on the other hand was very light and creamy and it was served in a reusable glass container. Earl grey seems to be having its day and showing up desserts such as pies and cupcakes. Bibble and Sip seemed to love it as it was infused into the banana bread and the scones had an earl tea glaze that I couldn't really taste. However, a breakfast panna cotta was an excellent way to showcase the subtle tea flavor.

This place was SO CROWDED and there was nowhere to sit/stand. There was also such a big line that you don't have much time to choose what you want. I randomly ordered the tea and raspberry macaron and didn't love either. We also had nowhere to stand/sit, so ended up leaving before I finished either. 

This is definitely a fun spot, but if you only have a few days in NYC, this might not be for you. If you're a local, definitely come check it out on a (potentially calmer) weekday where you can sit and enjoy. The owners seemed nice too and I'm happy for them that they had so many customers!"

I personal favorite like the matcha and earl  grey the best. But because they are super big, so I always had hard to decide whIch flavor haha.
The best way is to buy all and SHARE !

They also have some other very cute cakes and pastry as well, I heard my friend said it's good too, should try next time.

I reaLly lIke their matcha jasmine green tea in iced. It does has jasmine in the drink, I love it. 

Couple seats in the store and usually very packed."
924,bibble-and-sip-new-york-2,2020-03-10,4.0,"Stopped in with my colleague for coffee and enjoyed it. They have quite the deletion of treats. We split the cinnamon croissant, which was divine. Filled with JUST enough cream cheese icing. 

Quick service. 
Midtown prices 
They have a restroom! 

Cool spot!

924,bibble-and-sip-new-york-2,2020-02-16,4.0,"Small place that's always has a line swirling around the tables.

Matcha cream puffs - nice, crisp of an outer layer, followed by a thick matcha flavored cream. If you're like me.. and consume more than one in a sitting, you might find the cream a little too heavy. One leaves you wanting more, and two, a little too much. 

Sesame cream puffs - wasn't the biggest fan of this one

Adorable llama shaped macarons - so cute, but tastes just okay. Matcha macaron - good from what I remembered 

Matcha tea - your typical matcha tea; so good."

I will bring my Cat, maybe you can bring your FIDDLE
You can shop at Walmart, I will shop at LIDL
And then we'll go to Midtown, and take a Sip at BIBBLE

You can have the bits, baby, I just want the KIBBLE

What is green, puffy, and tastes average? (It's a RIDDLE)
It's a Matcha Cream Puff (yawn) from the Sip known as BIBBLE

WHAT

This is one of the traditionally most popular hipster bakeries, especially in the Midtown area, and it has so many Yelp reviews that there really isn't much point to me adding my thoughts to the collection. He says, adding them anyway.

But what I will say is that people who are obsessed with New York bakeries would probably love this (and I know Yael does - she sent me here) because it seems like everybody does, but me personally? I'm not really big into bakeries, and when I do like bakeries, it's not really the Hipster kind, it's the traditional kind, or the exotic kind (Asian bakeries, actual cheap French bakeries in France, Greek bakeries, British bakeries, Portuguese or Latin bakeries), so yeah.

So for me to like a New York hipster bakery, it has to be something utterly off-the-charts spectacular that it makes all the other bakeries seem redundant, which most of them are to be honest.

I know they're all really expensive, but I don't factor that in. I focus solely on: how good are these products compared to others at other places, and how much do I love them. By all of these yardsticks, Bibble and Sip would be a three-star bakery for me. I just don't find it spectacular. It has all the popularity and all the prices and all the hullabaloo of one of these top bakeries but it just doesn't taste like it can change anyone's life - but apparently other people see it differently.

Service wasn't great either - if it was great I'd have possibly raised it to 4. One of the other customers was very rude to me but that's not really the fault of the bakery.

Anyway that's enough for this review. I feel like I've been bibbling on about it for far too long."
924,bibble-and-sip-new-york-2,2020-02-08,3.0,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and was so excited to try it out. This place is tiny, crowded and loud so probably not the best study spot. Seating is also very limited so you may have to step outside to eat. I don't have much to say because my experience was very mediocre so I'll keep this review short. 

I ordered the matcha cream puff and a passion fruit jasmine tea. 

MATCHA CREAM PUFF - this was a 4/5. It was around $3.50 per puff. I love matcha and this was pretty good! I thought the interior cream part was going to be super sweet but it was not overly sweet and it was slightly bitter, which complimented the puff so well. The exterior was slightly crispy with matcha dusting on the top. This really exceeded my expectations, though I wish there was more of the exterior because I was left with so much cream in the end. 

PASSION FRUIT JASMINE TEA - this was a 1/5. I was super disappointed in this drink. Coming from LA, there are so many tea/cafe shops so I had high expectations... but this drink was so bland. It was more like water with a hint of tea and a splash of passion fruit. I couldn't even finish it! :( What a waste of $4....

I would rather spend my money on two puffs than the tea or some other drink, like their matcha latte or coffee."
924,bibble-and-sip-new-york-2,2020-02-28,5.0,"I stop this place sporadically since it first open. Cream puffs are my favorite dessert, and so it might be a good thing it's a hike to get here for me. 

I've only been getting cream puffs from them and here's my ranking in terms of flavor: 
1. Earl grey
2. Matcha
3. Black sesame 
4. (TBD) Thai Tea. 

As their many reviews say, their cream puffs are amazing their cream filling not too sweet so it's easy to just wolf one down yourself. Seating is tight, and there's almost always a line on the right side of the store. Their other pastries are super cute too, but cream puffs always take priority!"
924,bibble-and-sip-new-york-2,2020-02-18,5.0,"We came here after a friend took us here on our last day in the City. I'm revisiting this place from three years ago and reviewing it so late, so pretty nostalgic! I'll definitely come back to this and try out more stuff, because I hate the fact I could only try out one of their puff pastries as I came here for the first time without knowing about this place before! Lol 

I got the matcha puff because I really like matcha, this really hit the spot! The filling is so generous, puff so soft and delicate. They have such amazing variety of treats and drinks as well! Very cute desserts and instagram worthy! 

If your in the City, please visit Bibble & Sip, the vibe is really good and upbeat."
924,bibble-and-sip-new-york-2,2020-01-18,4.0,"Desserts are one of the best things ever invented and Bibble & Sip does it so well and I mean I think they are one of the best !! It's super adorable in here with all the alpacas in the store. It is a theme and I love it!!! 

They serve desserts with very cute designs and also teas. Plenty of options for dessert lovers and I seriously didn't want to murder the desert I got because it was just too adorable! 

The store is a  little small but still, they have tables and chairs that you can sit on. There are signs for where you order and you'll be able to get your complete order. 

Plenty of choices and I wanted to try so many other ones. Next time though!! 

Tip- Wish they sold the alpacas!"
924,bibble-and-sip-new-york-2,2020-02-15,5.0,"I love the cream puffs from Bibble & Sip. Though I've never visited the place itself, my sister who works in Manhattan is sure to bring a couple home from work when she knows I'll be home. My personal favorite is the Early Grey -- I'm not usually the biggest fan of Earl Grey tea itself but this cream puff made me reevaluate my taste buds. I have been lucky to try all three variations of the cream puffs and all of them are so tasty! They are baked so perfectly and every time I eat one it's the same great experience.

I would say if you're thinking to cut one in half, definitely use a serrated knife or a plastic knife with ridges. If you don't, you might squeeze the cream right back out of the puff. 

Overall, the cream puffs taste great. I don't know how the wait is but you can ask my sister. I would highly recommend."
924,bibble-and-sip-new-york-2,2020-02-14,5.0,"Awesome cafe, amazing iced tea. I frequent here because their green apple iced tea is phenomenal. Also when I want to spoil my workplace with treats bibble has the most amazing pastries, cakes, and savories.

Their everything croissant is incredible, and their breakfast sandwiches are hearty and consistent. They also have a Sichuan peppercorn tomato tart pastry thing I don't know what it is but it's delicious."
924,bibble-and-sip-new-york-2,2020-01-14,3.0,"It's a cute spot that has a large assortment of pastries...I'm not sure what the hype is about but I really enjoyed the earl gray chocolate chip cookie, and earl gray panna cotta is ok. The cakes are super pretty but they aren't something out of this world. I didn't see any vegan options but they do have almond milk for coffee. **don't get the panna cotta for the cute jar presentation the cookie is the winner !! 

If I'd come back I would get the chocolate chip cookie! The best thing."

When I took my first glance as I walked by in the morning, the line was out the door. It wasn't short either. I told myself that I'll have to return later. 

Later in the night, the crowds seemed to simmer down. Although patrons still filled the place, I was able to order quickly. I went for the Matcha Cream Puff and it was LEGIT. The amount of cream filling was no joke. Yes, everything else was very appealing and Instagramable. Got a few more delectables to join a two hour ride back home. Loved their cookies too!"
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2020-01-13,5.0,"I loved Perk.  I found them on Yelp around the corner from my hotel and was like yep, that's where I'm getting my morning latte.  My mocha latte was delicious as the barista suggested, I'd told them I wanted something sweet and that would perk me up, and this one sure did.  Absolutely delicious, I'll be back again at some point for more coffee."
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2020-01-27,3.0,"Cute little coffee shop in Murray hill. Menu is a little expert friendly as it doesn't specifically state that you can get cappuccinos, flat whites, etc but when I asked the drinks were happily made by the barista. 

They also sell regular drip coffee but the large isn't large enough for me, personally (i usually drink 1/4th of a pot at home) and it's only $1 less (if memory serves) so why not splurge and late it up?

I also grabbed a ham and cheese croissant which was delicious going down but upset my stomach within 10 minutes of eating - i'm not sure if this was a cleanliness issue on the shop or i picked up some good old nyc dirt before eating it"
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2020-01-09,4.0,"This was a cute cafe and was convenient when we happened upon it downtown. It's small and a bit elitist, but the prices are pretty competitive with the usual high-end coffee shop. 
They also have sustainable products which is nice. 
My family got regular - drip - coffee and I got a dirty chai with oat milk. All of us enjoyed our drinks. 
I'd stop through again."
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"The best latte we've had in NYC, hands down!!!!!

We've decided to give Perk a try after reading so many great reviews about this place. Upon walking in, I was a bit disappointed to see how tiny the place is, thinking we might have to look for another coffee shop that's bigger, where we can actually stay for couple hours to do some studying. Lucky for us, there was an empty bench by the door. We decided to sit there while I searched for the next coffee shop. Well, that plan didn't last long when we both took the first sip of the latte and agreed it was freaking delicious, enough for us to wait it out for someone to leave just so we could order another cup later lol. 

The whole coffee shop probably has about 15 seats altogether. There's one big community table right in the middle, maybe 2 small tables that could fit 2 people, and couple stools facing the street. Even tho the place is tiny, everyone from the owner to the patrons are extremely nice and friendly. We all knew not to take up too much space with all our stuff laying out, and no one was taking a whole small table to themself either. .5 star for atmosphere

We got to try a couple latte plus pastries. I can't say enough how good their latte is. You just have to try it for yourself. The pastries we had were also good. They don't offer any savory options, but that's really not a deal breaker at all. 3 stars for quality and latte art.

We did stayed for a little over 2 hours right until 5mins before they closed. The owner was so nice to offer my SO an almond croissant free of charge right before we left. He said they were closing for the night and weren't going to keep any of the pastries, but turned out, my SO expressed interest in an almond croissant earlier, but decided to go with a healthier option instead. We were both surprised he kept notice and so nice to offer us freebie. 1 star

Don't let the small shop deter you. It really is a hidden gem and offers the best coffee in NYC (at least out of the 3, 4 places we have been to so far here). We will definitely come back next time we are in town again.

This is the break down of my rating for coffee shops:
 Offering latte art consistently: 1 star
 Quality of coffee/drinks/food: up to 2 stars
 Atmosphere: 1 star
 Customer service: 1 star"
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2019-09-30,5.0,"Tiny little whole in the wall making incredible coffee drinks. They only serve beans from Stumptown (a Portland based company). 

We ordered the seasonal brown sugar cinnamon latte and mocha, both iced. They were not too sweet making it easy to taste the coffee. The mocha had tiny shavings of chocolate, it was reminiscent of a coffee dessert, so yummy!

Extra bonus points to Perk for having oat milk and paper straws!

I'll be back next time I'm in the city."
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2020-01-01,5.0,This place was walking distance from my hotel while visiting nyc! It was a prefect little coffee shop exactly what I needed in the morning before starting my day! They have special holiday lattes along with that they have the regular coffee and lattes as well. They don't have a oven so the pastries that they have will not be warm! But still very delicious. They don't have a full breakfast menu this is only good for morning drinks. They have seating available but it's very small. Cute place to visit if you are on this side of town.
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2019-12-24,5.0,Stumptown coffee offered - strong and good! A lot of alternative milk available. Commute table available for you to read/talk.

Hi Jem,

Thanks for reaching out to us and letting us know of the unpleasant experience you had on Dec 27th.  I was away for the holidays and immediately looked into this when I returned last week. 

This was not the first time we had complaints about the barista that you encountered. We put him on a program to improve his interaction with customers and it appears that it is not working. Thanks for letting us know since many employees tend to be on their best behavior when the owners are around but revert to their old ways when we are not. After speaking to other employees here about his recent behavior, we parted ways with him yesterday. Again, I apologize for the poor experience.....

Thanks Joel and Perk team for caring about your customers!  See y'all soon!"
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2019-06-12,4.0,"Needed a quick and easily accessible caffeine fix and found this place via Yelp. They offer all the basics as well as some specialty drinks like a honey latte and such. 

Went with a cold brew with oat milk which was excellent. In addition to oat, they offer almond and soy milks.

It's a small spot and all the seats were occupied when we went, by both people camping out with their laptops to work as well as those socially grabbing a coffee with friends.

Prices are extremely reasonable. A cold brew with oat milk and latte came out to just a little over $8, which sadly I find is closer to the price of one specialty latte in NY/LA."
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2018-12-19,5.0,"This is probably my favorite coffee destination on the upper east so occasionally I'll pop into this midtown location (I think the OG perk) for an americano. They make a great tasting americano from stumptown blends. Their pastries aren't bad, a selection of colson/dough and other outsourced bakeries.

The space is cozy, but enough for 15 people so I was able to chill by the window front. I could see myself relaxing here on a day off and people watching in this quiet part of gramercy/midtown south. 

Now I just need a day off..."
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2019-08-18,5.0,This is a small coffee shop in east Manhattan. I ordered the iced expresso and it was good. Didn't get to try their pastries but there is always a next time. The barista was really friendly. Had a great time.
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2018-12-11,4.0,"A hidden oasis in midtown east packing a delicious honey almond latte, fast wifi, and delicious pastries. The ham and cheese croissant is flaky, fresh, and highly recommended. 

It is a relatively small cafe with just one main rectangular table that sits no more than about 8, two small round tables, and some standing/ledge areas if you want to work or chat standing! There are outlets which is amazing because almost everyone had their laptops/e-devices and needed a charge at some point! The staff is friendly and helpful! A great place to bring your laptop to get some work done or just to enjoy a really good cup of coffee. I hear this place gets crowded very quickly and you have to go early in order to snag a seat if you plan on staying a bit. I walked in at about 11:30am on a weekday and found that there were still seats available and honestly, people come in and out so it's not too bad and it never felt overly crowded to me. Relaxed and cozy atmosphere if that's what you're looking for!"

I came here because I have found this cafe has free wifi and charge, but after coming, I got more some reasons why I'll come here again.
Mitchele Branch, The Corrs, acoustic sounds fit this environment. If you wanted to take a rest in the city, you should take a cup of coffee here."

925,perk-kafe-new-york,2018-11-06,3.0,"Perk Kafe is a very tiny place tucked in Midtown East. There aren't too many nice places like this in the neighborhood, so I was happy to find this thanks to Yelp.

The atmosphere is very cozy. However, it's also very small and gets crowded very quickly. There are many people here that stay here working for a very long time with a cup of coffee, as is common in places like this.

The coffee itself was very good. The service was decent enough. The barista was friendly but didn't seem to really know much about the coffee selection, or didn't want to explain it all. I ended up ordering a basic black coffee. No complains on the flavor though, since it was pretty high quality.

I'd come back if I was in the area and there were still seats available inside."

I see a high end espresso machine. I walk up to the counter and ask what  different drinks do you serve? We start talking and I chose a small Flat White which is less milk than a latte. Score one for the team!

I start BS'ing with the barista, I tell him I'm from Long Island. He said, I knew it from your accent! Damn hipster, gimme my friggin' coffee..

The coffee was on point, I like this little shop. 
Next time, no talking. 
A little less talking a little more action here.."

Food/drinks: I got the whole wheat croissant and the honey almond latte. The latte was great! Tasted great and came out piping hot. The wheat croissant.. meh. The baked goods are as is on the display and they don't have a toaster so it was kinda soggy and not that great.

925,perk-kafe-new-york,2019-02-22,5.0,"Good coffee. 

I popped in the other day knowing exactly what I wanted, a large black coffee. This woman in front of me kept asking the guy behind the counter for advice on what kind of milk to have in her cappuccino. I guess that's fine but when she started to read the labels for calorie content on each of them I thought I might lose it. I guess this is why I usually go to the bodega. Bodegas don't have milk choices. Keeps the line short. 

This woman finally chose oat milk. My buddy in Brooklyn is all about that stuff too. He buys it by the case. I suggested he just start making oatmeal and drain off the water. Pretty sure it's the same thing. 

Last time I made oatmeal though, I don't think I had enough water in there. It was kind of dry. Sometimes I think maybe I should take a cooking class so my oatmeal could be more consistent. Or maybe I should just add oat milk if it's too dry. I'll try that next time. Maybe that's why Matt keeps so much of it. Dude must really like oatmeal."
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2019-02-03,5.0,Yummy coffee! Came in for a quick pick me up. The staff was welcoming as soon as you arrived.

I also normally add two or three packets of sugar to all my coffees, and I didn't have to add a single thing. It was sweet enough without being over powering but it was more flavorful than it was sweet. They take their time making it, service is fast, and it's delicious."

Their coffee is decent, but the more memorable drink that I've gotten here is the iced honey almond. I thought the drink was a little too sweet, but had a good flavor overall. I think next time I would ask for less sweetness or try it not iced. They also have doughnuts from Dough!

Place overall wasn't too packed when I went on a Sunday afternoon or when I pop by for a coffee to-go. Seems like a good spot to study or if you have some time to kill."

It's a small space, but I love the vibe and how it doesn't get overcrowded. I used to spend lots of my days here doing work, reading, and just people watching. It's the perfect spot for some ""me time"" but also for when you want to meet a friend."
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2018-12-03,4.0,Local coffee shop hidden in midtown east. Usually busy with locals in the morning. Only a couple of tables so it's more like pick up and go type of place. My favorite is honey almond latte but they are not too strong. It would be better if when honey and almond flavors were stronger.
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2017-11-14,4.0,Friend and I came after work and had some tea. They had two options- the black/green tea mix and the berry one. Tried both- liked the black/green tea mix a bit more (it was unique). Will go for the coffee if I'm ever in the area- didn't get the coffee today because we went at 6 PM and I didn't want trouble sleeping at night after caffeine so late in the day haha.
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2018-09-23,4.0,"The honey almond iced latte does not disappoint. The ingredients are cold enough to start that they do not melt the ice too quickly and the flavor is amazing. This cafe is often filled with people working or studying and the atmosphere seemed pretty quiet. I have only been in off-peak times so was able to walk right up to the counter. The one employee working did not seem to be overly-excited about his job. Though he was not outright rude, he was not super friendly either. I'm not saying I go to coffee shops for friendly employees but he was not someone I would have been asking for recommendations."
925,perk-kafe-new-york,2017-01-06,4.0,"Cute small cafe in the heart of Midtown East. Found this by accident when looking for a cafe to have a quick coffee with a friend and discuss some work items. Perk has a nice selection of drinks as well as some tasty sweets. The coconut custard donut was particularly delicious. 

Nothing bad to say about this spot except I can imagine it getting very crowded at lunch time or after work due to its proximity to so many offices. We went at 1030AM and it was nice and quiet, however I'll have to go back at 1PM one day to see what it's like.

Good music and comfortable seating give it a nice overall feeling. I'll definitely be back"
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2019-06-04,5.0,"Very cool little shop with great coffee and really good food items. Not everything is organic but a lot is. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is phenomenal! I also got their granola yogurt. Overall I love supporting small coffee shops where the owners have a definite interest in producing quality coffee. Highly recommended!

Coffee is good too:)"
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2020-01-14,4.0,"Lucid cafe was solid, if nothing terribly special. I liked the drop coffee and plain croissant from ceci cela. Employees were friendly."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2019-08-30,3.0,"EXPERIENCE
1. Sampled Blk Coffee
- sour, smooth, couldn't get past the sourness 

2. Americano Au Lait (Homemade Almond Milk)
- similar to house blend, sharp, sour (spoiled?)
- almost reminded me of spoiled almond milk. Hope that was not the case.

SERVICE
- very good!

RECOMMENDATIONS
- offer different blends.
- sour dominant blends aren't for everyone."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2019-10-10,5.0,"This cafe is very tiny but extremely good, while visiting NY my hotel was just a few doors down and I literally pass this cafe everyday sometimes twice a day and I wanted to try it due to the fact that they were advertising the fall special of pumpkin spice coffee, but it always seem to be packed so I waited literally to the very last day of my stay to try lucid; we ordered a regular coffee and the pumpkin spice coffee, we were so happy with our drinks that we were mad that we waited until our last day to get a drink from Lucid. The staff were nice and they worked very fast to get all the drinks out to keep the flow of the traffic in their tiny space."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2020-01-26,4.0,"First time at Lucid Cafe, got the Vermont maple syrup latte, which was decent, but not great. Didn't like the burnt taste, perhaps that's what makes it from Vermont?  For $5.75 for a latte seems in line with other coffee shops in the hood. They do have a  punch card if you are a regular, you will benefit."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2019-05-31,1.0,"The worst coffee I've ever had after traveling around the US. My coffee tasted like nail polish, and the chai was basically water. Expensive and a ripoff, just go somewhere else."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2019-09-19,5.0,Very tasty coffee in a cozy atmosphere. Prices are very reasonable. The best thing is that they are unique and make their own alternative milk. Love it when people do things differently :)
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-10-21,4.0,"A super cute coffee shop on Lexington Ave, I came here on a Friday morning and was drawn in by a sign outside of their shop, featuring their ""Vermont Maple Latte"" I had to head inside and give it a go. I had ordered the Latte with almond milk, it came out to $6.25. (a bit expensive but that's NYC for you) it was quite delicious, but I don't think I would become a regular. Give me a buy 10 get one free punch card and maybe I would consider! All and all though it was very cute inside, and the pastries also looked delicious. If I were to go back I'd definitely want to try one of them as they looked as though they were worth the calories."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-06-02,4.0,"Happened along this cafe along my way to NYU hospital in the morning. The shop is very small with maybe enough room for just a few sitting patrons. Not really a stay and work type place, more of a grab and go.

I ordered a ham and cheese croissant ($4.25) which was in the display case. The croissant was served as is with no option offered to heat it up. 

Overall the croissant was good, buttery and flaky with nice cheese crust on top. However, the piece of ham inside the croissant was very small. Maybe 1 inch in width if I'm being generous, see picture. Would really have appreciated a larger piece of ham so I could have some ham flavor throughout the entire croissant."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-08-08,5.0,"Came in honestly to just burn some time before a model I was meeting showed up. So glad I found this little gem of a place. I may have only really gotten a fresh squeezed orange  juice, but it was well worth it. You could definitely taste the freshness in the oranges. They don't have too much seating (probably for about 7-8 max), 1 visible outlet that I could see. Ambiance is pretty chill, and the prices range from a 2.75 small coffee to 6.00 for their most expensive item on the menu"
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2019-03-31,5.0,Their Chai latte is yummy! Lovely baristas. Small cafe with only 2 small tables for seating but good on an early Sunday morning when it's slow!
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-11-23,5.0,"Fantastic latte and extremely friendly proprietors. If I lived in the neighborhood, I could see myself coming here every day. I have not tried their food, but the dishes I saw people ordering all looked good."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-04-20,4.0,"Tiny place with three small tables, 5 stools and bench seats for ~3 along the bay window. There's also a cute little bench outside the store. I'd been meaning to go in because it's so small and cute and finally decided to. The cashier is a warm lady who greeted me in Korean. After some debate she helped me decide on a Vermont Maple Latte. It cost $5.5 but that's normal for this area. I love that they have it to me in a cup and it all felt civilised and quaint. The foam design was so cute I was leery to mess it up by drinking it. The foam wasn't as think as I like but the coffee was superb. It was light, had hints of chocolate and maple and yet I could taste real espresso flavour too. I'll definitely be coming back on a weekend. This place is über cute and quiet enough for studying but busy enough for people watching. No WiFi. 

Update: Pastries are passable. I tried the ham and cheese croissant which wasn't warmed well and my friend had a spinach croissant which they didn't warm but were happy to when she asked them to do it again. My friend had a regular coffee with almond milk and said it wasn't the best and that there was particulate matter in her drink but my latte was good. I'd still recommend this place as it's so cute."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-10-10,4.0,"THE yummiest almond croissant in this part of town. So rich, so pleasant to look at, hold, and suck my teeth into, that I ALMOST didn't feel any guilt engulfing the entire thing (it's not a small portion). But to put my mind at ease, I washed it down with the cafe's freshly squeezed orange juice (sugar to chase sugar, YES). 

This ""little"" breakfast helped me through a rough day at work, so THANKS Lucid Cafe. Me and my appetite will see you soon."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-01-22,5.0,"This is a cute cafe with staff that is are always super nice and friendly. I usually get their chai latte here, which never disappoints. I also usually get a dessert such as their cookies, which always taste fresh, to meet their $5 credit card minimum.

I used to frequent this place a lot since it is conveniently located right next door to where I used to live. Perk Cafe is also nearby and has excellent coffee, but for a more intimate setting I would opt for Lucid. Though, their seating is pretty limited so wouldn't come here for a long study session, etc but maybe just a quick coffee catch up.

Would recommend to grab a coffee to go or for a quick meetup!"
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-07-14,5.0,"Best coffee in NY I was told by numerous people and they were absolutely right! Just about a block away from our hotel at Pod 39 on East 39th Street. 
Coming from Europe we have very high expectations of what is perceived to be a good cup of coffee. Their service is impeccable for a small intimate cafe. If you're ever in the area then I highly recommend checking them out."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2017-10-18,5.0,"My hotel was across the street, they have amazing Yelp reviews. I stopped in here twice in 3 days. Yea. I came back for a second round before headed to the airport!

I went with the Iced mocha - creamy with great chocolate flavor. There seemed to be little chunks of chocolate in it, which were nice little treats.

I went full on choholic and go the chocolate croissant as well. It's a nice sized croissant. It was flakey and delicious. Great flavor and a little powdered sugar on top added a nice little sweetness to the bitter dark chocolate inside.

I sat at a little bar and sipped while people and cars zoomed by. The place is small - which surprised me a little of how tiny shops in NY are. There are maybe 2 tables, not much room to maneuver. 

The staff was super nice and cranked out the goodies super quickly. Great spot to get my caffeine (and chocolate, I guess) fix."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-01-11,4.0,"This is a nice quaint coffee shop, close by Grand Central Station (or 'terminal'  depending on who you ask). If you blink, you may miss it. Standard coffee shop menu. Not a lot of seating. I'd recommend a ""grab and go"" situation but it was nice to catch up with a friend for a few, while sitting down. Staff is small, so there may be a bit of wait for your coffee but they are friendly, with nice big, infectious smiles. (Something that you don't often see in New York). The cappuccino is, of course, my drink of choice and they made mine just right. No need for any 'sugar in the raw.' Which has become my vice somewhat. So kudos to them for having a good cappuccino. Definitely give these guys a try. Reasonably priced coffee and I love when I can avoid the tyrant that is Starbucks and support a local business."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-10-11,5.0,"Cute little place with good cafe latte. Walking distance from Iberostar hotel. Our favorite coffee place that we found this trip. Went back twice before we had to leave NYC. 

Breakfast ham and cheese panini was good if a little greasy. Freshly toasted and the Korean citron jam helped cut the salt and grease.

Homemade honey lemon ginger tea was not too gingery and helped settle my stomach before my flight home."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2019-04-02,5.0,"This is literally my favorite place for a matcha latte in the city -- and I've had a lot of matcha lattes. Also, you have to get it with oat milk! It's absolutely delicious and perfectly creamy."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2016-05-18,3.0,"Ringing bells chime as you open the door, and you are greeted with smiles from a lovely girl and a young man. I was a bit startled at how small the place was and even more surprised at the amount of seats they managed to cram in there??!! The wood furniture by the window was actually very pleasant as I sipped my cappuccino in peace and serenity. 

The cappuccino ($4) was slightly milky for my taste, a tad bitter

Honey Lemon Ginger Tea ($6) - iced; Wow this is remarkable, SUPER REFRESHING, Perfect balance of sweet and tangy, the ginger adds this really cool sharp note, it was beautiful, Great on a hot NYC summer day! 

Others have noted the Matcha Latte, Dark Chocolate Mocha and homemade granola as great options here, I'll have to remember those for next time!

-----

6/9/16 - Iced Dark Chocolate Mocha. Whoa, am I drinking an airy chocolate cloud? The texture is smooth and velvety, there is a slight bubbly sensation like a nitro effect, the dark chocolate is very pronounced, deep flavor from real cacao, but the mouthfeel satisfies you like chocolate milk. Perfect for a warm day!

Recommended: Cappuccino, Honey Lemon Ginger Tea, Iced Dark Chocolate Mocha"
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-07-17,4.0,"This is easily one of the best coffee spots in the city. When you walk in, you can smell the coffee beans. The place is super cute, with very rustic decor. 

I got a plain iced coffee (I know, I am lame lol) and my friend got a cappuccino. Both were amazing, and I drink coffee more than water..

Overall, I would definitely try this place out for a GREAT cup of coffee!"
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2017-08-03,5.0,Wow such a cute little coffee shop. It's very small but has everything you need for a good coffee place. The staff was really nice and helpful. I got an iced coffee and it's actually one of the best iced coffees I've ever had. I'm Colombian and I'm saying that it's good coffee. It's also very clean and has great air conditioning. Definitely coming back again. They also have cute and cozy music. Nice place!
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2015-11-12,5.0,"This quaint little shop is unpretentiously located at 38th and Lexington, conveniently right own the street from my studio.

I first decided to try it because there are consistently long lines in the mornings and it always seems to be bumbling throughout the day. Mostly middle-aged working adults. I wouldn't necessarily say this place is a 'hole in the wall' joint. For one, its prices certainly don't say so. But, as many before me have said, it's New York and you wouldn't expect any less. 

The space:

Lucid Cafe doesn't necessarily give off rustic vibes though the interior is mostly wooden. I would describe it as quasi-Western cowgirl with Korean undertones. I can't articulate it precisely but there is something about the ambiance of the space that exudes its Asian business model undertones. Not necessarily a bad thing though. It's mostly in the vibe but also think origami cranes hanging on the door and overpriced--but not outrageously--mediocre photographs hanging on the wall both as decoration and for sale. The staff is primarily Korean, as they often talk among themselves in the language. I could imagine this place on 32nd St. Their sister cafe is located in Queens. 

The coffee:

They serve Counter Culture coffee and each cup is respectable. I'm far from a coffee connoisseur but their coffee fits my palate. Bold but not too pungent. 

I've never tried their baked goods but they seem to be sold out by midday. 

tldr: 

Lucid Cafe closes pretty early but if you need a morning or afternoon pick me up or you're looking for a place to sit and you see that one of their two tables or side bar is empty you should definitely stop by!"
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2019-07-04,2.0,"This place looked super cute and was right by our hotel. We decided to stop in this morning and ordered a fresh squeezed OJ and an Americano. The OJ was actually fresh squeezed and good but the Americano was terrible. And we've drank a lot of bad coffee. It was bitter, tasted like the machine had never been cleaned and it had an odd salty flavor. We asked if they could make us something else and the girls behind the counter all looked at us like we were crazy. We explained the coffee didn't taste right and could they make us something else. They said ""sure we will charge you though"". Finally after some embarrassing haggling they agreed to make another drink but only if I paid another dollar. Yes another dollar to make us another drink. You know what they did ...they poured the original drink into a new cup and added some steamed milk. We walked outside and threw it out. Stay away from this place. Bad coffee and even worse service."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2017-02-20,5.0,"My friend and I met up here before I headed to the airport, and Lucid is a cute and quaint little neighborhood coffee shop! Locals grab their morning coffee and pastry here, and everyone knows one another. 


The shop is VERY small, with just a couple of small tables by the window to sip and chat for a little while. But there's only standing room for probably about 5 people before it starts to feel cramped. However, that's just how it is at a coffee shop like this! 

I had a banana and a chai latte with soy milk. The chai was hot and creamy with a little bit of spice to kick off my morning. I loved it!"
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2016-12-02,4.0,"This is a tiny little cafe in midtown. Not ideal to work at due to the size, but great for a cozy cup of joe. The women working their were super nice and my espresso hit the spot. I would definitely stop in here again."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-01-16,5.0,"Visited based on a recommendation from a friend who had stayed nearby and found this fun little coffee shop.  It was a bit out of our way, but worth it. Solid service, outstanding mocha, great vibe in the place.  I had a delicious chocolate croissant and other food items looked yummy.  Tiny place - room for maybe 8 people to sit, but character galore.  Glad we took the time to stop!"
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-12-25,4.0,Very friendly. Cute and cozy spot. $5 minimum credit card. Open on Christmas days stopped by for a warm cup of cappuccino
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2019-06-07,5.0,Being quite well traveled am happy to say this is some of the best coffee in the world.
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2016-09-29,5.0,"It was cold and raining. I felt like it's a perfect time to try the honey lemon ginger tea. I walked in at 4:59 didn't notice they were closing at 5. The barista still greeted me with smile and made me a nice cup of honey lemon ginger tea. I love this place!

The honey lemon ginger tea tasted good and kept me warm. Though it was very hot, I had to wait for a well to drink. It served as hand warmer well. There were lemon slices and a piece a ginger. Not as spice as I imagine though, just a hint of ginger."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-07-10,1.0,"my second time here and this last experience was especially disappointing. the first time i came here, i don't think it was that memorable - a cozy spot with not that much seating space and an ok-friendly staff. coffee was good.

today when i went, i had ordered an iced soy latte (& tipped). the lady must have not heard me correctly and made a regular soy latte (warm). i didn't bother correcting her as she had already made the latte, and i was staying inside for a while. upon leaving, i still had more than half my latte left and as it was 90 degrees outside, asked if i could get a cup with ice. she was hesitant to agree even though i could tell she understood my request. she then presented me with a plastic cup and no ice. 

i asked her if i could have ice and explained i had originally ordered it iced but realized they hadn't heard me. she said ice was 50 cents extra and was unwilling to give me anything. after awkwardly explaining to her again i would've been willing to pay for the iced drink and had no change on me ($5 card minimum), i was about to take the cup and fill it up with ice at work, she very reluctantly filled the cup with ice. 

the entire experience was unfriendly and i never mean to jip businesses of their services, but at what cost is it to value 50 cents over customer loyalty? will not be returning!!"
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-12-20,5.0,"This teeny place has the BEST matcha latte in the city. It gets pretty crowded so it's not ideal for working all day, but they have to-go cups."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2014-11-23,4.0,"Very cute, small cafe with a few seats.

The barristas were polite and nice, the drinks were delicately made and very tasty, the price is a bit high but for a nice, occasional ""I did something nice for myself today"" place to take a breather when you pass by, it's a fantastic little place."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2018-03-03,5.0,Cute little mom & pop place.. it was right next to our hotel so we stopped in a few times. Very reasonable prices and friendly service
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2019-05-31,1.0,This place is fucking dodoo . My coffee tastes like nail polish and the the chai is straight up water. Don't put this shit in your body!!
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2017-07-06,5.0,"a cute korean couple work run this cafe. very small and cozy interior - about 6-7 people can fit in two small tables and max 3 can sit at the bar. 
i had shakaretto which was very good."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2016-05-02,4.0,"I almost missed this place until I realized that it was right around the corner - it actually shared the same street number with the cleanser store next to it.

Noticed that they have the homemade honey lemon ginger tea, so opted for that given the humid and chilly weather. Ginger was the best medicine for coldness; however the taste of lemon was a bit too strong for me...

As many yelpers helpfully pointed out, this place has a 5 dollar minimum for card purchases."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2016-05-02,4.0,"Mostly a grab and go cafe but there are limited seats for who want to stay awhile. It is a very friendly atmosphere and quiet so it is perfect for anyone who just needs a time out. 

My craving for a cup of Matcha Latte bought me here! Barista poured a cute heart on top of the latte. At first sip, you can feel the warmth and love for lattes. The overall drink is more on the milky side for me and I did wish there was more matcha powder but it did the job. 

They are opened as early as 7:00 am in the morning and as late as 5:00 pm, therefore, they cater more to the corporate business hours in the surrounding area. More of a 3.5 Stars rounded up to a 4, thanks to the cozy environment."
926,lucid-café-new-york-4,2014-05-02,4.0,"TINY but cute cafe w/ limited seating but snag a seat at the 2 tables by the window to enjoy your drinks!

they brew & sell Counter Culture coffee/espresso beans
---flat white: they make good foam
---iced soy chai latte: yummy
---iced soy green tea latte: VERY matcha tasting
---almond croissant: nothing special but huge & filling (from ceci cela bakery)
---vegetable quiche: a bit too salty but not bad
---ginger cookie: nice chew in the middle
---mango & pineapple smoothie: made with yogurt, not milk like the other smoothie option. Yummy!

the pastry selection includes scones, cookies, pain Au raisin

if you become a regular start a stamp card to score a free drink in the future

NOTE: EXTRA $1 for soy or almond milk but it used to be only 50 cents.. so this cafe is pricey for the lactose intolerant

Will come back soon (today probably)."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-06-10,5.0,"THANK YOU ZACH!! Order a Confetti Cookie Cake! I called it in and he was INCREDIBLE. So helpful. And, the cake was delivered the same day I called within 3 hours of hanging up the phone. (during Covid 19 cake was delivered within 30 minutes of the expected delivery time on May 26 2020. Ate half in one night and froze pieces that I could still DEVOUR even when almost iced cold. Totally a dessert that makes you say ""screw it"" and INDULGE. the cream cheese icing is thick and sweet covered in nonpareils"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-04-21,5.0,"Their Funfetti cookie is probably one of the best things that I have ever tasted. It's metaphorical crack cocaine. If you enjoy very sweet cuisine, it's for you. Before the pandemic, I would come here every once in a while for a sugar rush. 

The place's variety of flavors makes you want to keep coming back to try all the new flavors. A drawback, however, is that some flavors are seasonal (funfetti thank God is always available). For example, the dirty peppermint flavor, I think, is winter only; but it's one of the best they have. You can't blame them, though, for their creativity. 

Their packaging and set up is very creative and has a classical milk and cookies feel, too. Since I've left the city, I've had a dozen shipped to me. When I return, I'll be coming back regularly again."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-03-22,4.0,"Note: I'm catching up on reviews and got food from this location last week before the order was given for all restaurants to do take-out/delivery only. 

I got the chocolate chip and hangover cookies. The chocolate chip is a good solid version with satisfying chunks of bittersweet chocolate in a dense but not hard cookie. The Hangover though is a unique cookie with just about every ingredient you can think of. It has oats, semi sweet chocolate, white chocolate, M&M's, butterscotch chips, raisins, sweetened coconut, walnuts, and sea salt & vinegar kettle chips. Sounds crazy and it is, but an adventure in every bite!"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-03-20,3.0,"This place is good, but manage your expectations. I was expecting out of this world, Levain-level cookie lovin', and this place was more average for me.

The decor inside is cute and there are truly some interesting flavors. As someone who knows to treat herself with some baked goods from time to time, I'd welcome the opportunity to come back here again!"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-06-06,5.0,"Working in Midtown can be stressful, and when the sugar cravings hit, Schmackary's has been to my rescue every time. On many summer evenings in the Hell's Kitchen locale, I've always stood in a line and seen some of my favorites just disappear from in front of my eyes. I die a little every time it happens, but a new batch of some other flavor often replenishes it - and I'm even happier when its the legendary maple bacon. Besides the maple bacon, the chocolate chipped stuffed cookies that ooze warm chocolate at the center and the red velvet feel like a warm hug in a bag when you take them out. To an extend, I prefer Schmackary's over Levain Cookies due to the manageable portion sizes and flavor variety for when you aren't always feeling like going for a melty chocolate."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-02-18,4.0,"Stopped by this small little cookie shop on the way home. There was a line out the door and only two employees taking orders so the line moved relatively slow. They offer a decent variety of flavors which changes every month. I ordered two cookies, one Cookies & Cream and one White Chocolate Cherry Chunker. The cookies weren't hot when I received them but I ordered my cookies to go and was able to warm them up a little bit before enjoying them.

The Cookies & Cream was rich and chocolate-y and the cream cheese frosting paired very nicely with the chocolate flavor. The White Chocolate Cherry Chunker was oatmeal based and very reminiscent of an oatmeal raisin cookie. The white chocolate paired nicely with the cherry. The sweetness level was just right for me.

The cookies were both crunchy on the circumference and chewy on the interior. Consuming them warm definitely made all the difference. If you're lucky enough to catch a fresh batch, eat them right away!"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-01-02,4.0,"Need to come back ASAP to try the other flavors! To preface, I'm not a huge cookie person but I loved these 

Ordered:
- Yogi Bare: oatmeal based with PB, cranberries, sunflower seed (yummy! And doesn't feel overly sweet - good for those seeking a healthier option)
- Cookies & Cream: had to balance out the first one with something chocolate-y and more indulgent
(Oreo flavor was on point BUT -1 star because the frosting, while tasty, was superrrr sweet so we had to take some of it off the cookie to make it taste better) 
- iced latte: not a coffee shop so I wasn't expecting much but I really like this latte! Strong but not bitter 

Love the fun flavors they have and that they change them out depending on the day"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-06-09,4.0,"What a sweet experience. What really sold the shop Was the customer service. I can In, minutes before closing and drenched with a surprise summer rain and they ladies were so kind to me. I enjoyed the teats but I enjoyed how I was treated even more"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-12-01,4.0,"We couldn't help notice the line in front of Schmackary's as we walked to dinner in Hell's Kitchen. So after dinner we decided to see what the fuss was about and get dessert there. We waited in line but it moved quickly while we enjoyed the sweet aroma of fresh baked cookies. 

When our turn came we ordered a variety of cookies to share: Chocolate Chip, Funfetti, Maple Bacon, Cranberry Dream, and Ginger Rogers. They were all delicious and opinions differed regarding favorites. Honestly, it's so hard for me to decided but it's probably a toss up between Chocolate Chip and Cranberry Dream. The rest of my family loved the Funfetti the best. 

 14 year old was a little disappointed when we got to the counter they were out of ""Yogi Bare"" cookies (simply because he liked the name!) As soon as we paid they had them back in stock. Not a tragedy, but it would have been nice for the counter person to tell us they were baking and would be coming out momentarily. 

Delicious cookies, on the expensive side, but definitely worth the price and the wait!"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-01-06,4.0,"A cute cookie shop with even cuter cookies! 

I got the red velvet cookie and the gingerbread cookie and really enjoyed both. The cookies are a crunchier texture on the outside and softer inside. The red velvet had a type of cream cheese frosting on top which added extra sweetness. The ginger cookie had little pieces of ginger inside which I thought made it really fragrant. 

The service was really great and the shop is clean and well organized. There is barstool seating inside but the shop is on the smaller side."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-12-13,5.0,"Have to say I'm a big fan. I saw a YouTube video featuring this place and I've wanted to try it ever since. 

I love their style of cookie - big, slightly firm, chewy. They have several different flavors to choose from, including special seasonal flavors. If you go this holiday season, I highly recommend getting the Dirty Peppermint. This had to be my favorite cookie out of the handful I tried. The Eggnog was not good - highly do not recommend. 

The Funfetti seems to be the most popular cookie here. I definitely recommend trying this one as well. I love the texture of the frosting they put on top of the cookie. I also enjoyed the Caramel Apple and Cookie Butter cookies. 

The establishment is cozy and quaint. I think getting a box of these for someone is such a good gift idea! Definitely one of my new favorite cookie places in NYC."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-06-05,5.0,This place is nuts. If you walk by and there's no line out the door - it's a sign from above and you MUST go get cookies. The chocolate chip is freakin delicious but my fave is the funfetti. They always have cool new flavors to try. This is our go-to for out of towners and is totally worth the wait.
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"Our friends recommended these cookies to us during our stay in NY. We had to try them. And we did. We bought six - 3 chocolate chip, 1 pumpkin spice, 1 pick of the patch, and one butter pecan. The young woman who took and filled our order was friendly and efficient. All of the cookies looked beautiful, and tempting. 

We resisted eating them right away. We brought them home and savored every bite. The cookies tasted very good. They were sweet, chewy, and delicious. They were also costlier than most cookies we've purchased from bakeries. I think we could have baked these ourselves for less money, but it would have taken more time & energy than we had. They WERE worth the money we paid today. 

If you have time and talent, bake your own. If you have the money, and you want freshly baked, delicious cookies right away, AND you can get here, THIS is where you want to go for your cookie fix."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-02-07,4.0,"After having dinner near by my friend mentioned this place, we decided to stop by. 
When u walk in it smells amazing!! Love the smell of fresh cookies. I had the Funfetti & the Schmackerdoodle cookies. 
Funfetti is delicious, very sweet with that cream cheese frosting but it was good, a little less sweet if u remove some of the frosting. 
The Schmackerdoodle was great as well I liked the cinnamon & sugar taste so good both perfect with a glass of milk to top it off. 
Next time I gave the Red Velvet & The Monster cookies a try red velvet not bad very sweet tasting the frosting , The monsters cookie was very good nice combo the oatmeal & the peanut butter. 
Small location, quick service they have a decent variety of cookies, from regular to gluten free & even some vegan options. 
Cookie monster would be proud of this place, glad they have him perched up so he can at least watch Lol great cookies for just that right amount of sweetness."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-02-08,4.0,"On my way down the shore and decided to stop by quick and grab a bunch of cookies before catching a bus out of Port Authority. I'm glad I did- they traveled so well and were packed in a cute box! The guys working this morning were so nice and offered suggestions on what's popular. I grabbed 6 cookies ($15 total) which seem to be a good amount to share! We tried funfetti, chocolate chip, cookies and creme, bacon maple, candy bar and chocolate duet. Cookies are great to share- chewy but crispy on the outside. I prefer a more gooey inside but my friends liked them and they travel well!"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-03-09,4.0,"4.5 stars. There's definitely a cookie for you at Schmackary's. I was deeply impressed by the genuine variety in their cookies. I tried two - the maple bacon and the frosted cookies and cream. The maple bacon had a really good flavor (you could real taste the cured bacon!), but it was a little shorter (meaning more crumbly) than my preferred texture. Still very good if you like a crispier/shortbread-y cookie! 

The frosted cookies and cream, on the other hand, had a really nice variety of textures - smooth, creamy frosting on top of a just-firm-enough-to-hold-with-one-handle chocolate cookie. I didn't know this was possibly my ideal cookie, but it is! The flavors were great too. 

The shop also sells coffee and tea, and has seating for a few folks to sit. It's definitely worth a shot before or after a show (... or any time at all!)."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-08-30,2.0,"I was so excited to finally visit this place in person after having tried their cookies from a friend. But I was so disappointed to find such a limited selection - only about 8 flavor options and none of them were really calling for me. Of the ones I tried, the peanut butter was the best because of the peanut butter chips and the peanut butter frosting. But the s'mores brownie was a total fail - the graham cracker crust was so dry that it crumbled to pieces AND it had zero flavor. The brownie was also dry and didn't have enough chocolate chips for my taste. 

Now I'm nervous to give this place another try. I guess I know now just to pass if nothing looks particularly exciting. It's just that every flavor is tried before had knocked my socks off! Alas, no more."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-01-17,5.0,"I can't believe that I have been here gazillion times and have yet to write a review.  

This place has unique cookies, bars, and brownies. They have a lot of flavors, selections, and varieties and they change their selections throughout the day... between morning and afternoon, and day to day. So make sure to call or check out their schedule if you have a specific item on mind. 

My favorites are the German bar, maple bacon cookies, green tea cookies, and red velvet cookies. If you want to go light, go for the humming bird cookie because it's vegan and it has a perfect subtle hint of banana, pineapple, and cinnamon. 

The cookies are $3.25 each, brownies and bars are $3.75 each. They also have left overs from the night prior and they sell for $1 per cookie in packs of 2 cookies each. 

They also have drinks. I have tried to like their foamy latte many times and have yet to make the accomplishment."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-11-08,3.0,"I was excited to finally try Schmackary's cookies. My friend and I got their Caramel Delight cookie and Maple Bacon cookie to share, but they were both alright to me. The cookies tasted very sweet and I could only taste subtle flavors of the ingredients in each of the cookies. I could barely taste the coconut toffee bits in the Caramel Delight cookie and the bacon bits in the Maple Bacon cookies were not enough. 

I think this is a decent shop for cookies and I like that it does offer a wide range of delicious and unique flavors, but I don't think this place lives up to the hype or stands out from other numerous pastry or cookie stores in NYC."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-02-07,4.0,"Passed by this shop randomly and immediately became a fan! There is something retro here that I like. At first, I thought the price per cookie was on a pricey side but it is honestly very worth it! I actually ended up eating the two chocolate chip cookies that I bought here the next day and it still tasted so fresh! I popped it in the microwave for less than 10 seconds and I got a gooey chocolate chips, soft center, and a little bit of a crunch around the edges. This is how I personally love my chocolate chip cookies and this shop did not disappoint! 

I will definitely come back to try their other baked goods."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-01-03,5.0,"Omg- first time trying Schmackarys and honestly it's the best dessert to bring over to cheer someone up, get back together from a break up, the best ""I'm sorry"" cookie. This is a way to a girls (or guys) heart! Must try if you are in the area. They also deliver from Yelp and the service is super fast. There is a delivery fee, but it's totally worth it!

My absolute favorite has to be the frosted cookies and cream. It's a chocolate cookie with chocolate chips topped with vanilla frosting. So worth the calories.

Must try!!! You're welcome"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-02-01,5.0,"The green tea cookie was just okay, it had a grainy  taste. I also got a Rice Krispie treat that was crispy for sure. I would go back to try more. My cousin got a snickerdoodle cookie that was very tAsty."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-08-26,4.0,"DELICIOUS.
Who doesn't love freshly baked warm cookies.This place has some of the best cookies.Sch'mores is my fav.There is not much seating available and it is always full."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-08-25,2.0,"Went here on a Sunday night around 10 pm, line was out the door. I got the Funfetti Cookie and the Chocolate Chip Cookie.

I'm giving two stars for the poor service and not so friendly attitude of the two workers who were serving the customers that night, and for the fact that the Funfetti Cookie was mediocre as best.

I don't think I would come back here again. The Chocolate Chip Cookie was decent, however, it was cold and you have to request it to be warmed up, which I didn't know until the worker rudely informed my friends of that option when they asked."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-06-25,4.0,"I'm don't really eat sweets but these cookies were really good. The trick is to take them home, and pop it in the oven for a few minutes. It comes out with a soft center and slightly crispy edges. Pair that with some vanilla ice cream and it's the perfect dessert. 

Since there were four of us and we each wanted to try different cookies, we did the 6 for $15 deal. We got the classic chocolate chip, funfetti, strawberries and cream, blueberry cobbler, piña colada, and white macadamia. My favorite was definitely the funfetti. It was a little sweeter than I would normally care for because of the icing on top, but nothing a glass of milk can't fix. A close second was the blueberry cobbler, which reminded me of a blueberry muffin. I wasn't a huge fan of the strawberries and cream. It reminded me of a strawberry nutri-grain bar.

I wouldn't mind swinging by to pick up a few cookies if I'm in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so (again, not really a sweets person so that's part of the reason)."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-09-04,4.0,"Great spot to grab dessert or a late night snack after a broadway show since it's nestled right in between Hell's Kitchen and the theatre district. I've been here multiple times and it's nice that they have a points reward system towards a free cookie. 

I have had the classic, funfetti, and hangover cookies as well as the rainbow rice krispie. The cookies are big and soft, though the ones with icing on top tend to be too sweet for my liking. Out of all the cookies I've had thus far, I like the hangover cookie the best but I'll definitely be back to make my way through the other flavors."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-12-15,5.0,I stumbled upon this Cookie store while exploring the neighborhood. The cookies looked amazing and it was really hard to choose a flavor to try. My son And I decided on two cookies and we split them so we could each try two. We had the Dirty Peppermint and the Sweet Corn. The Dirty Peppermint wash a chocolate cookie with candy cane prices inside and a white frosting with peppermint pieces on top. It was good and it tasted exactly how we thought it was going to taste. The Sweet Corn was a totally surprise!! It wasn't overly sweet and the texture was unique because it was made with corn flour and cornmeal. It had chopped pecans and dried cranberries. These cookies were delicious and I can't wait to come and try them again.
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-08-31,4.0,"I can here on a Saturday afternoon because I was craving for good cookies. I yelp and saw great reviews about this place. I went here expecting a line but luckily there went anyone. (There was a like after my purchase)

I brought the Chocolate Duet and Cookies & Cream cookies. They have a deal 2 for $6. Otherwise it is $3.25 each. I definitely recommend those cookies.

I would definitely come back to try their other cookies. (Strawberry Rhubarb, The Peanut Gallery, etc)"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-06-10,3.0,"While visiting NYC this weekend, I passed this place while walking and I decided to stop in. The employees were extremely friendly, the shop was small and cozy. Since this was my first time trying this place out I decided to play it safe and order a regular chocolate chip cookie. 
The cookie was a nice size and the price for all cookies are $3.25. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the cookie. I am from Maryland and we have really awesome cookie shops.
This cookie didn't have much flavor to it. I thought it was me so I let my best friend taste it and she thought the same. 
Who knows, maybe I got a batch that didn't have much flavor!
I would give it another shot if I was in the area but it would not be the chocolate chip.."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-01-11,4.0,I ordered 6 to share with friends but I ended up eating 5 of them on my own because they were really good and addictive.
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-05-29,4.0,"I can't believe I've never reviewed this baking goods Mecca. 

This time I got a Schmackerdoodle ""deep cookie"" with Nutella inside (cinnamon chips, white chocolate, cinnamon sugar chucks), which looked more like a small muffin: soooooo decadent. 

Look at my picture to see what I'm talking about. Really great. 

The other cookies looked good, too, but this fellow stole the show."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-08-02,5.0,"All the times I have been to NYC and have never tried this place till now!!! Where have these cookies been all my life ? Granted the cookies are pricey (but really what good food in NYC isnt) but omggg best cookie I've had in a really long time. 
I got the s'mores cookies that was so chocolate/Graham heaven with a sticky marshmallows glaze on top. It got messy eating it later (took it on the bus ride home) but damn was so worth it! Now I'm disappointed I didn't take a whole box home with me to enjoy! Now that I know these cookies exist you know I'll be back when I'm in NYC"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-12-06,5.0,"Cookies must be a thing in NYC? Because, I never seen so many people line up for cookies. By chance I walked by and even though I just got dessert - I had to just to one. Well deserved after all that walking anyways! 

First of all their cookies a pretty big and they have great flavors and so many to choose from. It was overwhelming to just choose one but ended up getting the Monster and it did not disappoint. A thinner chewy type of cookie not dense at all but certainly flavorful. 

I would definitely eat another or go back if I get the chance. Do not be intimidated by the line it goes by quickly. Friendly staff! Ask for water you will need it."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-11-30,5.0,"Yum, yum, a millions times over again, YUM! Today I had the pleasure of trying Schmackary's for the first time, after lots of food blog & yelp recommendations, and I was elated! We had the pleasure of meeting the wonderful manager Louis who introduced himself. While my friend ordered a variety of cookies, I stuck with the s'mores brownie and an apple jack rice crispy treat . Both we're incredible! I love how this is a small, homey place with a so many unique choices of baked goods, lots of flavors of cookies, and a really nice drink menu with teas and whatnot. The atmosphere was so enjoyable and I loved the paintings inside and outside of the buildings will definitely be stopping in on my next visit to load up on my favorites!"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-11-24,5.0,"I was thinking what is in a cookie. But the cookies from this place is excellent. I tried Rocky Road, Peanut Butter Cup and Ginger Rogers. Rocky road was my favorite. It was chocolate cookie with marshmallow on top. Other cookies were good as well. These cookies are not heavy like the ones from Levain bakery. I could easily eat 2 cookies in a sitting."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-12-18,4.0,"Cookies here are yummy, but they are decadent. I like rich desserts, but I can't do more than one cookie here and even one is a lot. Most are soft and covered in icing. Really flavorful but sweet. My fav flavors are cookies and cream and funfetti. 

There are a few seats inside, but I wouldn't count on getting one since there are only a few and this place is popular. 

I will say I prefer Levains cookies over these, but these are great, too, especially if you like rich desserts."
927,schmackarys-new-york,2019-05-30,4.0,"Mmmm these cookies are crack. My favorite is the s'mores! I also had the maple bacon one which had a slightly chewier caramelized texture. I'm a fan and will be back to try the other cookies!

I got the sweet milk cold brew as well, which was pretty good. The condensed milk was a bit hard to mix though since it was sort of stuck in place at the bottom and the straw wasn't sturdy. Not a huge deal since that's how condensed milk is haha.

Cute place and workers are very nice!"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-03-01,5.0,"My friend and I had just left from an off broadway production on our way down to Penn Station and we serendipitously stumbled upon this abode of cookies from the heavens. I purchased the red velvet cookie for $3.25 and it was perhaps one of the best cookies I've ever consumed. The sheer taste and texture of this cookie was superb and far surpassed my expectations. Crunchy on the outside, gooey on the inside, a perfect ratio of frosting to cookie as well. The sugar crystals that you can see in my picture were just as good as they look. This cookie did not disappoint. I was shook bro. This cookie was straight fire. If you have a sweet tooth, this place is for you! My companion devoured his peanut butter cookie, which he thoroughly enjoyed. We both were very pleased with our decision to make a quick unplanned stop in this amazing establishment. I would return in a heartbeat! No question about it!"
927,schmackarys-new-york,2020-02-06,2.0,"Was really disappointed by Schmackary's since I had high hopes but it didn't live up to my expectations at all. My friend got the Hummingbird and I got the Ginger Rogers. Though the Hummingbird was better, it left an odd aftertaste. I didn't even finish the Ginger Rogers (and it's rare when I don't finish a cookie). They both seemed like they had salt in them...for $3 a piece you can get way better thin cookies at Jacques Torres (for the same price)! And if you just like cookies in general, stick with Chip and Levain's for $0.50/$1.00 more respectively. Trust me, it'll be worth it."
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-12-27,5.0,"Came by for coffee the other day and it was a tucked-away gem!

Ordered a mocha from the friendly cashier and my mocha came out perfect! Perfect temperature, smooth espresso, and chocolate that wasn't too sweet!

They have free Wifi and plenty of seating too!"
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2020-02-10,4.0,"We visited this popular spot this morning as we were on our way out to Lower Manhattan.

The Flat White and Cappuccino were truly delightful. We both really enjoyed our short visit there. The place was cozy and fairly accessible.

Would come back again!"
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2020-01-28,4.0,Stopped in here for the first time before heading to work. I was greeted immediately by a friendly man. Ordered a large cappuccino wIth almond milk. The barista said they only have one size and it's small lol. I said that was fine. He made it quickly. It was $4.75 which is a little pricey for the size. But it was delicious! A little bitter at first. The foam was perfect and he made a beautiful design with the almond milk. I only wish it came in a larger size! Haha. I'll be back to try more menu items for sure..
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-12-21,5.0,Great coffee!  Great customer service!  Also had a ham and cheese croissant which tasted like the ones from Europe.  If you have a chance stop by here and grab a cup of joe. You won't regret it!
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-12-28,4.0,"Very nice independent coffee shop, it has a very cool vibe and the usual suspects (aka weird characters) there's also cocked and pastries. The coffee is a bit on the acidic side for me but if that is your taste, this is a good one"
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-09-08,5.0,This place is AMAZING! Best vanilla latte I've ever had with super friendly service and gorgeous latte art! Would highly recommend if you want to start your day off right!
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2020-02-21,5.0,Love this place. Coffee and food is all perfect. Mindful baristas. Writing spot. Or place to meet a friend.
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-09-06,5.0,This coffee shop feels so cozy and unpretentious. The space is small and the menu is simple and straight-forward. The barista was super friendly and helped us pick out a delicious ham and swiss croissant. My latte was picture perfect and tasted as lovely as it looked!
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2020-02-20,5.0,Great spot to rewind and recharge after a long day. Great coffee and sweet treats hits the spot!
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-08-11,4.0,"Great spot for a quick coffee. Iced latte, with a little honey, was just what the doctor ordered. Friendly staff, quick service, and just enough seating for a small group."
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-08-07,5.0,"Small shop off, easily missed but worth finding, laid back from the main roads.

Nice cuppa and great friendly staff."
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2020-01-08,4.0,Very very good coffee place ! Cappuccino was perfect and tasted yummy . Small place but cute place to grab a cup of coffee and a croissant
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-10-28,3.0,Really small coffee shop in Hell's Kitchen that seemed too good so I decided to try it. The place is super small and I expected good coffee the amount of people and good recommendations there. I was disappointed. I think the coffee was just okay! I had the latte and I was just a regular drink but just over priced in my opinion
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-01-15,3.0,"Came here to do work with a friend. Frisson is a cute coffee shop that sells your standard caffeinated drinks with an assortment of milks and pastries. 

The coffee shop is fairly cozy, fitting maybe 15 people. The table are small so it's hard to do two laptops a table. There is free WiFi. 

Ordered
Matcha latte with oat milk - pretty art, the matcha was slightly more brown and bitter, indicating a lower quality, which was disappointing."
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2020-01-17,5.0,What a delight!  The Kough Amann (pastries) were fantastic! A must try for any sweet tooth. My girlfriend and I enjoyed caramel and vanilla lattes which were made to perfection. Bold and rich made with the right amount of sweetness. The staff was really welcoming and helpful!
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-07-07,5.0,Stopped in Frisson Espresso during a short stay in NYC and was looking for something off the tourist areas. Found this small gem based on Yelpers. Had great service by Lehorah and James and the cappuccino was as good as any I've had in Europe. Cool small place with local vibe in Hell's Kitchen area.
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-12-05,3.0,"This place is fairly close to Times Square but didn't scream as a tourist trap so we picked this for our morning coffee. The baristas are efficient and get your order to you quickly but I was fairly disappointed by my vanilla latte overall. The taste of any vanilla syrup was lacking and the latte had very little consistency. The service was good and the space is nice but with the amount of good coffee in NYC, I probably won't be returning."
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-05-28,5.0,"I came here on a rainy afternoon to get some work done, and Frisson could not be more perfect. As I approached the counter, the baristas were very very friendly and really left an impression on my experience here! Their matcha latte with oat milk was just what I needed. 

The shop is small, simple, and quaint. I love their window seat and wish I could have been lucky enough to snatch that seat. This is probably not the meeting spot for a big group of people, but for those flying solo, it's a great little coffee shop."
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2020-01-31,5.0,I'm always anxious trying a new coffee shop because there are so many ways to screw up a latte. Not here. All the baristas are on point and friendly as well. Plus they have heavy cream for breves. Not sure what else to say.
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-11-27,5.0,Oat milk latte and oat hot chocolate with proper barista oat milk!  Bloody delicious.  Matched only by the coziness  and warmth of this cute little cafe.
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-11-06,5.0,"Another really good coffee shop in Hell's Kitchen? Yes please. This is a small shop with a few tables, so don't plan to bring a table full of work and expect to have a place for your coffee and a pastry. Instead, bring a friend out your family and enjoy their company over some delicious espresso beverages served by really friendly staff. If latte entices you, theirs is a step up from most. Of course, the coffee taste is the most important part, and I was satisfied with that, too. The pastries were also great. The kouign amann, croissant, blueberry muffin, and jalapeño cheddar danish were all really good and worth getting again. I'd go back."
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-04-21,4.0,My latte was delicious and the girl at the counter was super nice.  Unfortunately they didn't have any of these raspberry scones everyone was talking about so maybe next time!

929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-12-11,4.0,"Not a huge fan of coffee, but the mocha latte here was really yummy. Good portion, just the right amount of sweetness, and just enough coffee to keep me up.

There's no public restrooms, but there's a decent amount of seating with outlets. Will definitely go here again if I'm in the area and need a quiet place to sit and work."
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-03-29,5.0,"My new favorite NYC Coffee Shop!  Why you might ask.......
1)They have oat milk! Such a delicious alternative! Especially for us who are lactose challenged.   
2)Customer service is just lovely!  I've been twice now and had two different baristas. Both provided good service and made an excellent Flat White with oak milk. 
3) Great little location with wifi if you want to enjoy your coffee on site."

Pros

- Super nice people
- The space is dope
- Free Internet!
- Cool art
- Cold brew was delicious

Cons

- My flat white was essentially a latte
- The Internet was slow my entire time there"
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-02-19,3.0,"My cappuccino had too much milk, and left me wondering if there was even any coffee in there.

929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-10-27,4.0,Loved their latte! I am a sucker for latte and I found this place through yelp when i was nearby. Looks like a local gem with great coffee and pastries. Place is quite small with tables and high top bar table as well. Look forward to coming back here to try diff coffee drinks!
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-04-03,5.0,"If you find yourself in their neighborhood, make a point to stop by and have an espresso drink!

Quaint, clean, friendly and great coffee drinks with alternative non dairy options.

If you're lucky to get the window seat, it's a great way to relax and watch the world go by."
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2020-02-13,5.0,Why even come to New York if you don't look for this kind of place? One of the beat cappuccinos I've had in the city - with nice milk art to boot. The coffee was superb. There was a Starbucks across 8th Ave closer to our hotel that was packed. This place had a steady stream of regulars and a good seating area for it size. Wouldn't get a plain croissant - ours weren't especially good - but that's the only food we tried. I would go out of my way to come back here. Want to try the cortado.
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-01-04,5.0,"What a great stop and the end of the night!  

Thanks Yelpers for helping me find this spot. 

A cappuccino was well done. Just the right temp and the scone slightly warmed paired well together."

Sometimes the stools all get filled up and there's no place to sit, but this is New York City and that happens and it's a busy area in the theater district.  I'm usually taking my coffee ""to-go"" anyway.    Great place for sure.  Check it out."

Not too hot, not too cold, and the presentation was very professional.

The service was very quick, wasn't too crowded in the coffee shop itself, and the café accepts credit card and has even gone paper-free with its ability to text/email/etc. receipts!"

Will definitely recommend everyone to get a coffee from Frisson Espresso and it will make your day much happier:)"
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2019-06-25,5.0,Amazing service! The staff working there was so helpful and sweet. The coffee was great too. I wanted an almond croissant but they didn't have any at the time I went. I wish they had more options here for food but I highly recommend for a coffee!
929,frisson-espresso-new-york,2018-11-12,5.0,"Wandered into this coffee shop tucked away in the corner while in the area. It's super cute and very small so I was surprised that it was so crowded. But we also went on a Sunday afternoon so that might be why. Despite the crowd, there was a good amount of people just chilling and doing work on laptops. 

I got an skim milk latte and the espresso was really strong! It has the kind of latte where you take a sip and you know it's a serious. Don't know if I'd ever go out of my way to come here since it's so far but 5/5 stars for a coffee shop!"
930,pickler-new-york,2020-01-24,5.0,"You don't know how good a place is until you start missing their sandwiches. 

When it comes to ordering sandwiches, I always do it online. 

When it comes to what type of sandwich, it's always the Rachel. Turkey pastrami, just like a Rueben but it's Rachel. 

When it comes to the two free pickle, well, I've tried all flavors. I'm more sour and spicy.

Pro tip: There are 2 cashiers and two self serve iPads (by the cashiers). So when it's busy, there's technically 4 windows open. Just order online."

I ordered the hot pastrami and loved every bite.

I tried two pickles on the side - horseradish (horrible) and spicy (good, still not great).

Hot pastrami is a win - took one star away for disappointing pickles."
930,pickler-new-york,2020-06-11,4.0,"Came here to pick up my sandwiches and in general they were not so bad, I kind of liked them, although the prices may seem higher than other spots could offer but all ingridients in my sandwiches were super fresh and it was tasty. Little slices of bacon were so easy to chew them and that's ultra level of making food. Very good for breakfast and also you can grab here a cup of something hot and with a sandwich it gives a good beginning of the day. However again, a bit pricy but with good quality."
930,pickler-new-york,2020-02-21,2.0,"Stopped in on Tuesday afternoon for lunch. I had the Avocado grilled cheese with bacon and sadly it was really disappointing. Somehow overly toasted, almost burnt bread with 0 cheese pull or even fully melted cheese. Ingredients were fresh though - so I gave an extra star. The pickle was decent but from a place with this name, I would expect nothing less. Priced alright for a manhattan sandwich spot - but I won't be visiting again."

Cons: don't provide you with the option to purchase a beverage or a pickle via seamless or yelp...since I didn't see the option to purchase a pickle, one would assume it came with the sandwich. To be on the safe side, I specifically requested one on the side = got nada. Bummed, especially since ""pickle"" is literally in the name of the store :("
930,pickler-new-york,2018-11-30,4.0,"Pickler & co is a good spot for sandwiches in the midtown east area.  It's a little pricey for the size of the food, but it's good quality.

Pros:
I've tried a number of things on their menu and have been satisfied with all of them. I'm a big fan of their make-your-own option. I go with Swiss, turkey, chipotle mayo, avocado, and caramelized onions - a delicious combo. It comes out pretty quickly; I've never had to wait more than 5ish minutes, even when it's crowded. 

Could be improved:
The layout of the place. It's confusing when you walk in - the menu is on the walls and people are often standing by the register while they wait for their food. Occasionally I've had minor issues with my order (forgotten tomato, etc.) but that kind of thing happens everywhere once in awhile. 

There are a few seats inside, but it a small spot and gets very crowded in the afternoon. I'd recommend taking your order to go."
930,pickler-new-york,2019-11-27,1.0,The brain trusts at Pickler didn't turn off their order receiving so they accepted my order and I went out to pick it up only to learn that they had closed at 2pm -- 45minutes before my order was even placed. Get it together pickler!
930,pickler-new-york,2020-01-27,3.0,High price for not much food. Can taste quality ingredients though. Highlight is the pickles but they were out of the spicy. Odd payment system and current menu prices changed. There is a charge if you want to add extras or a discount if you don't which is an odd concept. Nothing special $14 for just a sandwich no sides.

930,pickler-new-york,2018-07-27,3.0,"3.5 stars - first time here and I'd like to return before giving it a higher star review.  So the expectation is there but I'd like to have a second taste.

Passed by on a whim - exploring my work hood and wanting to find something different, this caught my eye.  Oddly it shares a building with a local College but the space works.  Limited seating so I took my order to go.

Grabbed an avocado grilled cheese sandwich today.  In it had sliced tomatoes, chunky avocado, jack cheese and grilled on multigrain bread.  By the appearance, I think they grilled my bread too much for my liking (see photo).  So while not as pretty, it tasted great.  Liked that the avocado was a bit chunky and not like a spread, it adds substance.  The tomato was semi thick sliced so again, making it more hearty.  The jack cheese combined with all that, tied it together.  Yum.  

I watched the sandwich crafters at work and am thinking a second visit to try the burger and the other grilled cheese that caught my eye - it's a bacon with caramelized onions, two cheeses on sourdough.  Hint of garlic mayo too it says.  You had me at the bacon.  

One note about the sandwich, it did get a bit messy to eat so I'm glad I had mine to go.  So I scarfed it down in the privacy of my office with a ton of napkins on hand.

Note:  there's a line but it moved quickly.  There was also a pickle bar where you can grab a few but I couldn't get close enough to take a pic.  Too many people!  :-)  Will let you know how it is when I return."
930,pickler-new-york,2018-07-30,5.0,"I came Monday morning to get breakfast. I was kind of shocked how the place was completely empty.

I ordered a toasted Egg Man sandwich for $8 which is arguably expensive for breakfast. But let me tell you it was worth every penny. My sandwich came STUFFED with egg salad and yumminess. I wanted to save half for later but I couldn't cause it was too damn delicious. I expected it to be a little saltier with the ham and cheddar but it's actually on the sweeter side. 

After breakfast I fell into a food coma which we all know can't be good for work. No regrets though. I can't wait to return!"
930,pickler-new-york,2018-09-07,5.0,"Passed this place on a whim for some quick eats. Coming off a flight and needing a quick meal for the morning, I needed some food stat. So that $5 Avocado Grilled Cheese was exactly what I needed. 

It was my first bite in NYC in awhile, and the grilled cheese was pretty good. It came out super quick in less than 5 minutes and everything about it tasted good for a breakfast sandwich.

The pretzel roll was definitely good and I enjoyed the softness of the bread. The avocado worked well with the grilled cheese, which was satisfying. The sandwich was hot and tasted fresh. 

Tried my friend's coffee and it was pretty good too. 

I'd recommend here for a quick and affordable bite."
930,pickler-new-york,2018-09-28,4.0,"Great sandwich.

Imagine my shock and dismay, anger even, when I opened the sandwich up to find that, instead of bacon, the woman assembling it had given me the burnt scraping of bacon from the stove's drip tray. 

Shame on her!"

Ordered a Plain Bagel, with American Cheese and 2 Egg Whites. 9$, which is mighty expensive for the bagel. Then when I got back to my desk at the office, I take out the bagel and unwrap it. Noticed that they had FORGOTTEN THE CHEESE. How do I pay $1.50 for a slice of cheese and not seem to have it in the bagel!?!??! A bagel with two egg whites tastes like shit.

Very unfortunate as I wanted to like this place."

930,pickler-new-york,2018-07-21,4.0,"I stumbled across this place earlier this week as I was trying to find something new to try out near my office.

The place looks nondescript from the outside, but it's actually a decent sized place in the inside.   You enter into the ordering area, where there's a cashier and two self-service counters for you to order on your own.  It seemed a bit confusing at first, but I seemed to grasp it pretty quick.

To your left is a seating area with a bunch of barstools to eat in and the chefs behind them preparing the food.  I ordered the avocado grilled cheese and it took me about 5 minutes to receive the order (wasn't too bad).

The avocado grilled cheese was pretty solid for the most part.  The avocado, mayo, and pepper jack mix in pretty well.  If anything, the sandwich was slightly on the smaller side, but it was also $6.50 so can't complain.

I did have a couple issues to mention.  First, the bread was quite burnt.  They need to be a bit careful going forward because multigrain bread can get burnt pretty easily.  Second, the grilled cheese either needs a bit stronger wrapping or maybe I should be provided with a small plate because the mayo can drip a bit and cause a little mess on your desk if not careful.  

Nothing too crazy, but it's worth mentioning going forward.  The grilled cheese was good and this place will be in my rotation going forward."
930,pickler-new-york,2018-06-03,3.0,"Came here at around lunch time on a Sunday and it was relatively quiet. Luckily they serve breakfast all day as that was what I was craving for.

Tried their breakfast BLT and a latte. The sandwich was pretty good, just a little stingy on the bacon :(

Coffee was a disappointment....doesnt have much a strong coffee taste (probably too much milk) and it also had a sour aftertaste to it, which i didnt like

Price was reasonable though."
930,pickler-new-york,2018-12-18,5.0,"Oh my goodness, I love me some Pickler. 

This place has incredible, affordable sandwiches in the heart of Midtown East, where food standards are low and prices are high. Highlights for me have been the Rachel, Turkey Club, Avocado. But really they're all good.

It's also not obnoxiously busy and lines move pretty quickly. 

I will dearly miss it when I move offices next year."
930,pickler-new-york,2017-08-18,5.0,"Randomly found this spot by Yelping ""sandwich"" near work. Thank goodness. I did an online order for a NJ Sloppy Joe - (Double decker roast beef, smoked turkey, Swiss, thousand island and coleslaw. Pressed)...and then, in the 'comment's' section, prayed that they could swap the swiss for goat cheese, the coleslaw from greens, and the dressing for spicy brown. I definitely thought I had zero chance of actually receiving the meticulously-crafted (and admittedly probably annoying) sandwich. A Yuppie Joe?

I arrived at the place, was greeted quite nicely, offered some free sample cookies (REALLY GOOD - chewy and chocked full of nuts) and other treats. I tell the attendant my name, get my sandwich all wrapped up...and just wonder version of the NJ Sloppy was underneath. I got back to my office, unwrapped my treat...and what lay before me was..exactly what I ordered. Boom. Loved it. 

What more could I want? More cookies, probably. Until next time...."

You order and pay at one counter, but pick up your food at another. This is somewhat, and unnecessarily confusing at first. There is a sign sarcastically indicating tourists and small children tolerated, as well as no restrooms. The food quality is good, the quantity is adequate, and the prices are ""New York"" average to moderately high. We enjoyed our rueben sandwich but it wasn't warm throughout, and the bread could not be press grilled any darker. Perhaps they could heat the sandwich fillings on the flat top griddle longer before building and pressing the sandwich. Overall OK, but I won't be rushing back."

930,pickler-new-york,2019-01-28,5.0,"It wasn't love at first sight.  

The first time I walked in to PIckler, they messed up my order.  I wanted a Breakfast Rachel but got a Rachel which had no egg.  When I called, I was expecting them to replace the sandwich but instead they just explained that there were two (2) types of Rachel sandwiches, the regular lunch sandwich and the breakfast one. To be fair, I did walk in close to noon and since it was my first time at the store, I did not realize that I had to specify Breakfast Rachel. 

Although I was a bit disheartened, I thought I'd give them another chance. A few weeks after I called (yes, I guess I'm the only one who still calls in an order) and asked for Breakfast Rachel. This time, sparks flew. It was perfect! I've not had anything to complain about since then. Just goes to show, sometimes you have to give it time to see the best in people. I know..I know.. in New York, who has the time, right?! Just think about it, ok?"
930,pickler-new-york,2019-03-29,3.0,"I had heard great things about this place and other reviewers really seem to like it, so may have to come back and try my luck with a sandwich. Came here this morning and got an avocado toast on gluten free bread, and I received the saddest, littlest piece of toast I've ever seen. It was TINY. They did put plenty of avocado on it, which I respected, but the flavors were bland and could have used some salt/pepper/lemon. Also wasn't that big of a fan of the liberal application of pumpkin seeds. My experiments with ordering gluten free bread in NYC have been wildly inconsistent, and sad to report that the GF bread here is dry and tasteless. Also got a large orange juice, which was good -- nice and pulpy, just the way I like it."

930,pickler-new-york,2018-05-30,3.0,"Man, the pictures looked better than the taste.

I work close by and came here for lunch. The positive is that my sandwich was made in literally 45 seconds, the negative is that it was dripping in vinegar. I got the spicy Mediterranean wrap and it was just average - way too much onion and swimming in vinegar 

The pickles were bomb AF though! That was the upside.

I might come back to try the grilled cheese sandwiches, those actually look delicious!"
930,pickler-new-york,2017-04-22,5.0,"For starters again, Rockabye was playing so bonus points for that.

So I ran 9.15 miles this morning and was fucking STARVING afterwards. I wanted a big, fat, juicy breakfast sandwich. Sometimes I just crave bready and cheesey. And by sometimes, I mean all the time. 

It's a nice, crisp, spring Saturday morning. I step outside and it's drizzling so I have to immediately turn around and walk past my doorman and go up to my apartment to get an umbrella just to go back down to walk past him for the 3rd time in 45 seconds. Classic. 

I must've read the location wrong because for some reason I thought it was on 46th street so I walked an extra block. Classic me. 

I found the entrance confusing (I did drink a decent amount last night, it was my birthday, so let's blame my cognitive difficulties on that. Like my CSF was literally tequila and hefeweizen). 

I walk in to what I'm not sure is the actual place I'm attempting to locate (this place) but decide to bite the bullet anyway. God forbid I get a subpar sandwich tho.

I walk up to the counter, there's a lot going on in this place when you first enter and the 25% of my frontal cortex that was functional was overwhelmed. I greet the girl working there with a ""good morning"" until I realize that I think it was like after 12 and I ALWAYS do that, it's so embarrassing. People are like...uh....it's like 2pm... Like, people have actually said that to me before. Please try less hard to make me feel better about saying something stupid. 

I go with 2 scrambled eggs (should've done three) well done, with pepper jack and I ask for a bread recommendation. The girl suggests ciabatta or sour dough. I went with the former although I was intrigued by the ""pretzel roll"" they have. Price was super fair, $4.40.

While I was waiting another customer comes in and the girl says ""good morning...uh..sorry I mean afternoon"" to him. I guess inaccurate time perception is similarly contagious to yawning.

Lol, I haven't even gotten to the food yet. 

My sandwich was prepared and I set off on my trek home. I dig into the bag and pull out this beauty. 

It was wrapped snuggly but I was disappointed in its size. Wouldn't be the first time. Amiright?

Size aside, it was magnificent and warm. I separated the two halves and the cheese was still melty like on commercials. Holy shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit. 

The eggs were cooked to PERFECTION. The bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The pepperjack was barely noticeable. I doused that shit with valentina EXXtra hot and went to work. 

The sandwich was spectacular. I devoured it like an animal. 

Only problem was the size (ugh, classic). I was still hungry afterwards. Perhaps I should hve ordered a bagel or more stuff in it. Maybe it really is my fault."
930,pickler-new-york,2019-06-25,1.0,Have had sandwiches here before but never as disappointing as today. I ordered the chicken salad on toasted multi grain and since they didn't toast the bread at the same time the sandwich sat... and soaked. It was a total mess and really bummer since it's a $9 sandwich. I feel they should be better about those details. Probably will go elsewhere for chicken salad from now on.
930,pickler-new-york,2017-04-24,4.0,"Stopped in this morning for breakfast around 9am before work. There were a few people in here but it wasn't crowded at all which was a nice surprise. There was a small breakfast menu by the register which was nice to see the options but made me feel under pressure trying to go through all the options with the cashier staring at me. I wish it was in other places too so I could have decided earlier. 

I decided on getting a classic bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel. Everything was delicious except some pieces of bacon weren't as crispy as the others. That's my only real complaint about the food. They have salt, pepper, mustard, and ketchup packets where you collect your food which I like can then you can put it on yourself! Overall the sandwich was pretty good and i'll probably be back for breakfast again if I'm ever running early to work."

930,pickler-new-york,2016-07-20,1.0,"Extremely disappointed at my Experience and Order yesterday (July 19th ~12:15pm)

I came in before a rush, only several people there, but within 10 minutes there were 10-12 ppl. They ALL received their food before me, even though I ordered first, waited more than 15min. Terrible service. I ignored it because I remembered the food was excellent last time.. 

Ordered a GF Chicken Finger Wrap with Goat Cheese, Red Pepper Jelly, and Arugula $10. A ""Simple"" Order, no way to mess it up:
- FORGOT the red pepper jelly
- FORGOT the Arugula, I got a scant leaf of something else
- 2 goat cheese morsels were packed in on the ENDS of the wrap (?????)
- APPALLED at the portion I received - it was barely bigger than the size of 2 mustard packets, the entire thing fit in the palm of my hand, barely had any chicken

I was left starving and had to buy a second lunch that day. I seldom give 1 star. What a downgrade from last time.
------------------------------

UPDATE: The owner contacted me and I was made aware that the Gluten Free Wrap is a smaller size than their normal wraps. That makes it a clearer but still doesn't excuse the slow service and a wrap that forgot a few items I ordered. Like he told me, these are very rare slip-ups. My 1st time here was stellar, so you can trust the high reviews from Pickler & Co."

Conveniently located near Grand Central, Pickler & Co is a great spot for  a quick grab-and-go lunch! It was packed when I came by on a Wednesday around 12:30pm. Thankfully, I didn't have to wait because I ordered ahead.

The Grilled Cheese & Avocado sandwich comes with pepper jack cheese, avocado, tomato, and mayo on multigrain bread. Trust me, they don't skimp out on the avocado and the sandwich was such a great combination of flavors. I was definitely reminded of my childhood.

yes! didnt you know that everything that taste really good is always really good for you? They are so tasty and creamy and have so much flavor without being so overpowering.

The only reason I'm giving this a 4-star instead of a 5 is because there isn't enough seating areas for me to sit down and just enjoy my pastry. Other then that I would definitely come back and grab a few to go since there's not enough room to just relex there. I also think you should eat like 10 or more a day! Jokeing. But definitely stop by and try one especially if you appreciate a good eclair..."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2020-02-06,5.0,"Wooo  these eclairs and variety of eclairs was amazing. Such a cute little place. This place is definitely pricey going for a whooping $5.75 per eclair but it was worth trying it I couldn't afford it everyday. 

I had the matcha green tea eclair and it was to die for. Biting into it and the feel of it feels cold and hard  but when you bite into it it's a whole other story. It has a nice oouter crunch and soft bite with creamy milky flavored filling inside. It was delicious! I also had a raspberry eclair which had fresh raspberries sitting on top. Presentation is nice and the taste is everything. I'd   Definitely give this place a try and  there was free ssamples of their chocolate chip cookies at the front counter. 
Who doesn't love that?! They were delicious as well."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2020-06-11,5.0,Excellent cakes. It was my first time here and I ordered the Wendy cake and it was a big hit at my moms birthday party. (She's french is a very picky with her french deserts and loved this) Excellent presentation and taste.  I will absolutely get another cake from here in the future and am excited to try out other baked goods.
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2020-01-17,2.0,"Came here as a short stop for some pastries in the afternoon due to the great ratings on yelp and unfortunately was disappointed with the bakery.

We ordered an almond croissant, pistachio eclair, raspberry panna cotta, and the crunchy. The desserts didn't taste fresh and felt like they had been sitting in the display box for a few days. The sweetness level of the pastries were good and not too sweet, other than the crunchy. I also ordered a cappuccino which was fine. 

Overall, eclair tasted like the other chain bakeries that I've been to. With so many different options in manhattan, I won't likely be back."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-12-06,3.0,"Bright and fancy patisserie specialized in all types of eclairs. I got the dark chocolate, hazelnut, almonds & caramel, duche de leche and raspberry. 

Although the fillings and toppings were decadent, I was not a fan of the dough, which tasted old and not crisp. Considering how much they charge, you'd expect better quality."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-12-07,4.0,"Pretty nice bakery if you're in the area. Despite the name, the eclairs aren't the best thing here (although the cream filling in the eclairs is great). Believe it or not, when king cake is in season, it's really amazing.

The croissants are pretty good too, if you get there when they're fresh.

Service can be hit or miss depending on who's behind the counter, but it's good more often than not."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-10-21,5.0,"A very cute cafe with brightly lit seating areas! There are some outlets spread out if you choose to do some work at this cafe, noise and crowd levels are at a minimum. There's more seating at the back of the cafe which should be even more quiet. I like to judge cafes based on what's on their menu as well as the environment - how spacious, clean, and comforting it is.

Overall it's a nice place to do some work and relax, catch up with friends, and everything looks delicious! I'm not the biggest fans of eclair but I tried the matcha one and it wasn't too bad. Coffee was good too. Some things are slightly overpriced however, definitely on the pricier end which is why I didn't order any cakes even though they looked gorgeous"

The other side of the store is where they do their baking. 

We had a few goodies! Blondie, Nutty eclair, and a Nutella tiger. All was delic!"
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,Yummy! This is a cute patisserie that looks like you're in Paris. Very cute. They have a great selection of coffee and drinks and eclairs. I had the pistachio eclair and it was so perfect. Very light and not too sweet. Just the perfect place to have a little me time.
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-12-29,5.0,"Cool place, much bigger inside than it appears on the outside. We had a Blondie which was way better than I thought it would be, a delicious almond crunch eclair, and 
a tiger Nutella which is Nutella surrounded by a chocolate chip cake. Bright, neat, and clean. Definitely will be back when I'm in the area."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-11-25,4.0,"UPDATE** 

THE BEST PUMPKIN PIE EVER! Make sure to order some for thanksgiving! They now say they have silverware, just ask for it at the front when eating in! Don't waste the plastic :) Very friendly service and consistently good baked goods and open late! 



Congrats on the new space! Lots of room for sitting in and they will start serving quiches, sandwiches, and salads soon. Their fresh baguettes are wonderful and the panna cotta I had was the best I've ever had! So delicious, not too sweet, nice vanilla bean flavor, and tart raspberry preserve on the bottom, topped with fresh raspberries. The small latte I got was delicious as well but the cup was huge, perhaps they can start having smaller cups. Also I hope they add silverware to the sit in area, much more sustainable and saves resources, more pleasant to eat with, and doesn't create unnecessary waste. Highly recommend you check this place out if you haven't stopped by"
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-10-28,5.0,"Omg everything is so good! The desserts are all too pretty to eat, but you obviously can't resist and have to eat them haha. I also love getting hot chocolate from here. I live a few blocks away so it's my go-to when I'm craving something sweet!"
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-12-17,5.0,"I stumbled upon this bakery- upon the arrival of my sweet tooth. I am a big eclair fan, usually from wegman's or a local store. I tried 3 different flavors and was absolutely wowed. A bakery centered around eclairs?! Incredible. The service, also wow. They were accustomed to speed. I'm sure they're used to a long line. Although the line was reasonable, they were masters at helping 3 people at a time, while remembering what you ordered. I even got a free large coffee out of the visit. Great experience, and so so delicious. Only drawback- you're in NYC so no surprise... it was a bit pricey."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-04-10,5.0,"Happened across this little bakery on saturday morning, while walking through a neighborhood I'm rarely in. This is the best thing about just aimlessly walking in our fair city with no itinerary in mind- happy accidental discoveries. 

A taped sign on the door caught my eye, and I was intrigued.  It advertised a boxed assortment of eclairs for 50% off.  It lured me into its pastel colored interior.  I basically stared at the vast selection for several minutes.  I debated internally - should I just get 2 eclairs - one for me, one to share?  But that would cost almost as much as the boxed assortment, which seemed perfect for a party, but a little excessive for spontaneous snack. The box won out (I mean, who can argue with a dozen minis for $12.50?)  I ended up giving a few to a friend at brunch later in the afternoon, and brought the rest home to my dutiful bf who had just finished caulking the tub. 

My only regret was that I did not take note of what flavors the box contained.  I really should have taken a photo of the display case, so that I could figure out which flavors I was eating."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-12-11,5.0,"This bakery is amazing! I randomly got a cake here years ago for a friends bday and still remember the taste of it to this day. I get a few pasties every time I pass it and can never pick because they're all soo good. Really, just pick anything!!

The vibe is so french and just a great place to hang out."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-04-28,5.0,"A must if you are in the area. The eclairs are amazing and will leave you wanting more.  You should try them all, you will not regret. The other items are equally as good.
The blonde is ridiculously good!"
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-09-25,4.0,"I love the decor of this bakery. As per their name, they specialize in eclairs ($5.95 ea) with a 12-mini-eclair-sampler going for $25.

I always marvel (Read: DROOL) at the wonderful desserts in the display case but usually end up getting some eclairs. I definitely need to come back in the near future to start trying their other sweets.

-1 for the service from the women behind the counter. When asking legitimate questions about the flavors of the eclairs, I get unhelpful responses and negative attitude. It seems like they really do not enjoy their job, which is a HUGE no-no in the service industry. As a manager, I would look into the hiring process - even a simple SMILE does not happen (nor a WELCOME - the store was empty, so they weren't busy, just loitering).

PRO TIP: groupon has a cash back deal for this place, just add it to your credit card, and you can get a small discount on your purchase."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-03-09,4.0,"Eclairs done well! Loved the selections too, at about $5 a piece, worth the price!

We made a short trip to check out this lovely bakery, initially when we approached the shop, exterior was very basic, outdated and unimaginative. The interior was very simple but could also do with a bit of a makeover, nonetheless there was decent seating (for 12-15 people), the sofa-type seating was actually quite comfortable.

Walking up to the counter, to the side just before the baked goods display, they have some pre-made baguette sandwiches and snack foods alongside where the drinks were. There were a lot of baked goods I've also not seen in other bakeries too, such as pecan croissants. But I came for the eclairs :D 

From what I remember, they had matcha, dulche de leche, hazelnut, blackberry mascarpone, almond crunch, cheesecake, pistachio, original and a few others. I went with matcha, almond crunch and cheesecake (as well as one of their Nutella donuts, $2.50)....the verdict:

Cheesecake- I just wanted to drown in those perfectly shaped cheesecake peaks adorned on an eclair shell base, the fresh raspberries on top gives it a nice tanginess that cuts the density of the cream cheese. They didn't add too much sugar to the cream cheese which was great as it was but I appreciated the light dusting of icing sugar on the eclair. Only thing I would say as a minor issue (for all 3 eclairs I purchased) was that I felt the choux pastry a little too firm which can happen if left in refrigeration too long (residual moisture gets into the 'pores' of the pastry) or over-baked. My favourite of the 3, definitely $5 well spent!!! :D

Matcha - had a great ratio of filling to pastry, the matcha being very evident throughout the whole eclair without being bitter. The consistency of the filling was like silk and deliciously creamy!

Almond crunch- loved the textural crunch factor of the almonds, as with the other eclairs, the almond crunch eclair had that delectable creaminess that was perfectly silky. 

Nutella donut - for American standards, it's quite small. Don't like Nutella? They had strawberry jam one too. There was ample amounts of Nutella but the donut tasted like it had been there for a day or 2, not super fresh.

This place gets quite busy too, but the aunties behind the counter handled it like pros, getting to everyone's order in a timely manner. The bakery doesn't have a restroom and I can't say it's suitable for children/babies nor groups larger than 3. Not stroller or wheelchair accessible."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-09-30,5.0,"Decided to stop by for coffee and desserts after dinner. It was my first time here. The place was so clean and beautiful! I loved the decor. They have gelato's for $5, a variety of desserts and of course coffee and tea. Prices were reasonable. The gentleman (Hispanic guy) that helped us was super nice and helpful. The lady (which I didn't get her name) seemed moody. She was not nice at all. Regardless, I loved the place. I ordered a latte which wasn't the best I've had but it was okay. My friend got a latte too and he loved his. The chocolate chip cookie was amazing!!! So thick and delicious!!! If I'm ever back in NY, I'll visit here again."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2020-03-28,4.0,"nice modern, casual spot in midtown east. good selection of pastries and definitely enjoyed the classic eclair. decent amount of seating. Give them a try."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-09-13,5.0,"Fantastic eclairs. Felt like I was Paris with the French music playing and endless choices of baked goods. Eclairs are $6 each and the sample testers (of all their 12 flavors) are $25.

The place was super clean, and mostly empty because it was a Friday night! The transparent kitchen behind the kiosk was cool to see. Everything gets made from scratch here, no wonder it tastes so delicious!! From the fresh heavy cream to the buttery flaky donut exterior that melts in your mouth, mmm I am in love. It was to die for"
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2018-12-14,5.0,"Oui oui!

These Eclair Bakery eclairs are awesome!  Having sampled a few different versions I honestly can't say there is one I didn't like.  My absolute favorite has to be the almond chocolate crusted version but the traditional, matcha, cheesecake, chocolate,...  all really good as well.

This is definitely on the list to revisit for eclairs for sure!"
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2018-10-10,4.0,"I got the raspberry cheesecake eclair and overall really liked it, but thought it was extremely sweet so definitely come with a sweet tooth. The presentation is really nice, and I like how the cheesecake creme on top was more on the firmer side making it neat to eat. 

The place wasn't too crowded when we went on a Saturday night around 8pm which was nice since the bakery itself is pretty small. There are a few tables, but the place could easily get cramped if more than 20 or so people are there.

Overall a cute spot to catch up with a friend while sharing something sweet."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-06-16,5.0,"Amazing coffee, macaroons, and delicious eclairs. Tons of choices to choose from, along with abundant seating. There are also seats that face the front, where it is an open window to people watch or enjoy the warmth.

Definitely a must visit when you're in the mood for baked goods or an iced coffee on a hot day."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-10-22,5.0,"Love love love ALL pastries, cakes and eclairs! As an Eastern European daughter, I grew up enjoying home made bread, cakes etc, so that makes me a very picky eater. Thank you Eclair for living up to that tough competition :) 
If you are in the mood for croissant (almond chocolate my favorite), eclair ( almond with gold dust) or trio (chocolate mousse), and wait PUMPKIN PIE, you name it. Super fresh and yummy!"
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2018-09-10,4.0,"Came on a rainy Sunday night and was ecstatic to find that their tasting box of eclairs was half off! Glad I got to try 12 flavors instead of 1 or 2.

They were all unique though my favorites were the hazelnut (also beautiful with the golden flecks on top) and the raspberry! Now I know which ones to get when I return. 

Looking forward to trying the range of pastries they have beyond eclairs as well. It's a cute little spot on 53rd, a bit away from the avenue so it's not too loud. Great place for a date or get together"
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-03-24,5.0,"YUM YUMM YUMM!  Excellent selection eclairs and various desserts but I opted for the King Cake, which was absolutely delicious.  Very friendly staff and a nice calm environment to enjoy coffee with a dessert or two ... or three."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-09-01,1.0,"Love this place! Great coffee, pastries; especially the Mini donuts. HOWEVER: 

The absolute negative, snarky, rude service from the women behind the counter is unacceptable! 
Joking around, laughing, carrying on leaves a very bitter taste when I left. This is not one incident of terrible customer service. 

The worst part is, I have seen many reviews and reports of this ongoing issue, and yet management or the chef owner has yet to respond.

I'll find a better bakery in the area."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-09-16,5.0,"You can never go wrong with trusting Stephane for making a great surprise Bday cake. We were celebrating three different generations turning a landmark bday and we needed something in the Bee theme. I had told Stephane roughly all that I needed and I left the rest to him. Let me tell you! The cake was AMAZING! From the presentation and detail to the taste. It was a wendy cake for 20 people, with yellow topping and lots of bees. If I can I'll attach a picture of it. You must get your next cake or sweet catering needs from him. You'll wow everyone! Thanks, Stephane !"
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-12-13,5.0,"I placed an order online for the mini eclairs tasting box. Perfect size and amount to share with coworkers! Not to mention they are beautifully decorated.  All the flavors were on point and just the right amount of sweetness and the cream wasn't too heavy at all. The cashier was kind enough to write out all of the flavors for me which I really appreciated. 

I also got a chai latte and it was really good as well. The chai was strong without overwhelming the drink and the perfect amount of sweetness too. Highly highly recommend this place!"
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-03-31,5.0,"I went to Eclair Bakery after dinner and loved it! When I walked in I was amazed by the adorable and large space, especially with the ample seating in the back. I split a chocolate chip cookie and almond eclair with my friend. The chocolate chip cookie was so rich and tasted like straight cookie dough. The almond eclair was great as well and I really want to return and try the other types. This place is such a hidden gem and I will definitely be coming back."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-08-20,5.0,"Discovered this bakery, on a trip to the city but only got a chance to grab a latte at this place (which was phenomenal)! When I stepped in and saw all the goods, I knew I had to make a trip back! So this time around, I was proactive about making my way over! Grabbed some coffee and then started the difficult decision making process of what I wanted to splurge on! All of the eclairs looked amazing and the macarons seemed very very fresh! In the end, I opted for the box of mini eclairs so I could sample a bit of all of them. The chocolate eclairs were all amazing! The pistachio and matcha minis were very flavorful and refreshing to try! All of the eclairs has something great to offer! This is definitely going to be a place I stop every time I come into the city! Next time, I hope I can try the other goods but I feel like I'm going to get pulled towards the eclairs again! The inside of the bakery was brightly designed and the staff was warm and welcoming! There was ample space to sit down and chat with people! Discovered a quiet gem in midst of this city!"
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-01-19,5.0,"We had a king cake, a dolce de leche eclair,  and a canelé. The kind cake was extremely flaky and the almond past I side was not sweet at all. It was a little messy to eat, but we enjoyed it. The dolce de leche eclair was very light and not overly sweet. It was topped with caremalized slivered almonds. I'm glad that I got to sample the canelé, because I didnt get a chance to try it on my trip to paris. It was caremalized on the outside, and had a custard-like consistency on the inside. I would definatly order it again if I'm back. We washed it down with delicious cappuccinos. This place serves traditional french desserts made the right way. Their desserts are more in line with something that you would get in Paris."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2018-06-20,5.0,"They have different type of eclairs and many varieties of French desserts. We ordered the tiramisu and lemon tart. My friend and I liked the lemon tart more than the tiramisu. The lemon tart was not overwhelming citrusy and tasted very fresh. They both were delicious and not over sweet. It is actually a very good French dessert. We were there at 7:30 pm after dinner, it was not busy and there were tables lining next to the wall. Decor was simple, but I liked because the main attraction was dessert. There was a calm music in the background too. Prices were regular compare to other famous dessert places. 

I will definitely come back and try more of their goodies.
Bon appetit."
931,eclair-bakery-new-york,2019-02-27,5.0,Their eclairs is just awesome. You can pick any and it should be good. Hazelnut and almond crunch were my favorites. Pistachio was good too. But in general any eclairs here is good. There are some seats in the store to sit and enjoy the eclairs and may be a coffee.

It came to a point where I asked my employer if we have any corporate discounts for Coco (answer was no), followed by asking the manager how much I can buy this location for (answer was no, I can't because I have nowhere near the $$$ needed). I might as well send my direct deposits to this place."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2020-01-21,5.0,"I know a Boba place that will drive you LOCO
Although it may give you more gas than SUNOCO
And if you buy too many drinks, it may make you a BROKE HO
But you won't mind because you'll love the milk tea at COCO

Almost as delicious as Ice T's COCO
Even more delicious than Sheldon's Kaley CUOCO
Your waistline will hate you like Lennon's fans hated YOKO
But you won't care once you taste the milk tea at COCO

Better than every single Boba place in SOHO
Makes a lot of Boba stores just vanish like a DODO
More popular in NYC than f**king POKEMON GO
Come and get a milk tea of perfection from COCO

What to get: Bubble Milk Tea Hot or Cold
What else: Katy Perry did a song called Hot n Cold
What else: Katy Perry is hot but her response to my proposition to her was Cold

A very long time ago I was very fortunate to discover the Wonder of Coco. Great Neck was the very first location I ever tried and I fell madly in love with the bubble tea drinks here.

I actually think this place was so good, that it was one of the reasons I became obsessed with Bubble Tea in the first place. I've probably had 3,500 of the things since then. But not all from this location. Most, but not all.

This is a tiny little location which I like a lot. I come here whenever I'm on the East side of Midtown.

It's wonderfully close to Grand Central Station, and this cute little Coco store gets it done for me, and when I say little I mean really really little. It's just a tiny little room, but they make great milk tea and have nice service too.

It's a cute little hangout and one of the few boba shops around Grand Central that I come to regularly.

If you're near the station and you want Bubble Tea than this is one of your best options.

And now for some more rap.

The Boba here is Lennon, others are Yoko ONO
Others are Imagine Dragons, this Boba's BONO
Popular with college kids, so watch out for MONO
Don't drink Buffalo water, you'll get HASHIMOTO
Hope it doesn't disappear like brains and the DODO
Hope it doesn't rebrand with a poop in the LOGO
Hope it doesn't start selling hot coffee and COCOA
Hope that when I'm here, I run into Ice's COCO
Hope they let me watch him put his Marco in her POLO
Hope that Trump doesn't try to kill CUOMO
Hope that hipsters don't try to imitate Perry COMO
Tastes so good I have to drink it in SLOMO
I pick Boba here like the Giants picked off ROMO
If you went without me then I would get FOMO
If Coco Boba were a boy then I would be a HOMO
The best Milk Tea in NYC is called COCO!

932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-12-06,2.0,"I LOVE CoCo.. when it is good, it's like it's raining straight from heaven. When it's bad.. it's BAD. This was one of the main things I was looking forward to when visiting New York, but this location was such a disappointment. 

Got 2 large milk teas. Did not finish either of them. I would normally never throw away a drink, but this one left such an unpleasant, powdery aftertaste it was honestly more pleasant to get rid of it than keep tasting it. 

2 stars only because I love CoCo as a franchise. Hopefully this was a fluke and it's not normally this bad here."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-08-14,4.0,"I love milk tea and I've been to many places and so far I'm comparing pretty much every tea/milk tea places. Now I know every place is different but the drink base is pretty much the same which is Tea. 

I think this place is just average nothing that pops up and making you want to come here just to get milk tea or tea drinks. If you happen to be in the area and wanted to get milk tea then this would be your only choice. I mean it's not bad.

I order Sago Mango Green Tea and they ran out of sago and its only 5pm.. how can you ran out of one of your main ingredient that is in the drink and on the title of the drink and on top of that they have many sago drink in the menu.. come on, stuck up especially when it's summer time.

Drink wise, I like it because I'm Green tea lover sometimes I add mango taste to it, make it refreshing green tea drink."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2020-01-08,4.0,"CoCo makes good drinks, and the servers are friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that I wish they had more milk options. I was asking if they had any plant-based milk alternatives (such as oat or nut milk), which they do not. Apparently most (or all?) of their milk drinks are actually made with Coffee Mate, which I was really surprised to learn. (Coffee Mate is lactose-free, but does contain caseinate, a milk derivative). CoCo is a staple in the NYC bubble tea scene, and I'll probably keep going for the fruit-based teas and their deliciously tender tapioca pearls, but honestly, it's 2020 - can't we have some options when it comes to milk products?"

But...what am I if not helpful to the yelp community?

CoCo has jumped on the bandwagon for the new craze in bubble tea / boba: black sugar pearls in milk. It's all over China/Taiwan/HK and instagram. They started offering this on Monday (3/18/19).

They're calling it the Lava Pearl Latte - and they're made in batches while supplies last. They have only one size (M) and it goes for $5. The bubbles are made in this smoky black sugar and fresh milk is poured over it. Makes for a perfectly instagrammable photo that actually tastes good.

Never fear - the drink isn't as sweet as it sounds. Comparable to approximately 50% sweet give or take on their regular drinks. You can't adjust the sweetness or ice levels for this drink.

Please don't all line up and take away my new snack! (Or go when I'm not around)."

My friend ordered the 3 Guys drink which is their house milk tea with Tapioca, Pudding and Grass Jelly. The Milk tea tastes great with 70% sweetened. However, the topping is a little too much. It is like a full meal, very fulfilling. I would definitely recommend this boba tea place if you want to check out a great Milk Boba Tea place!!"

All four of us were indecisive in what we wanted to order, and because we were taking a while, the staff member gave us a blank stare, like she was done dealing with us. However, it was a Saturday night, and I wouldn't call working at Coco my kind of Saturday night. After much contemplating, I ordered the mango green tea. 

The mango green tea was refreshingly sweet! It didn't taste powdery at all; rather it tasted freshly authentic. The Coco staff member put in a lot of boba in our drink, which I appreciated! The boba was chewy and sweet, although not as sweet as places such as Boba Guys's. 

Even with this drink being my third boba tea this day, it was still great to drink! From one boba addict to the others out there, this Coco has my vote!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-04-20,5.0,I usually get the regular bubble tea but decided to try their limited time Lava Pearl Latte. I wasn't disappointed. It has the right sweetness to bitterness ratio that I like. The place is clean and convenient walking distance from the Grand Central Terminal.
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-07-18,4.0,"Stopped in for a boba tea today.  I really liked how you could choose different levels of sugar and ice.  I had the berry party tea (summer special) with 70% sugar and less ice.  I don't like a lot of ice in bubble tea because the boba get trapped under the ice cubes, but the drink wasn't as cold as I would've liked due to ordering less ice.  The tea was really tasty with chunks of real strawberries in it, just a little awkward having the berries and boba come through the straw altogether.  I'd definitely go here again and try other menu items because the boba was the perfect texture!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-10-05,1.0,"My friend and I were very excited to come to Coco for a bubble tea. The moment we went in, the server was cleaning. We kept calling her with no response. She seems very annoyed at her job or something. But we were unhappy with our experience. RUDE ATTITUDE!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2020-01-28,5.0,Wanted a quick bubble tea before I left NY and this  quenched my craving. I had the Hoji bubble Milk tea on ice and it was delish. Price is your typical bubble tea.
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-01-01,3.0,"Loved my drink (matcha milk tea with cream) but the service confused me.

I thought I was being perfectly pleasant ordering my drink but the girl at the register literally snapped at me when the drink I first ordered wasn't available. Ok that's fine, no need to be angry? Ordered something else and I wanted less sugar and yet again, she continues the hostility by cutting me off and saying that they have different scales for sugar adjustments. Off day? I enjoyed my drink tho so I guess I'll be back if in the area."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-08-19,1.0,So coco... their sizes unless I'm tripping have dropped over the years. Also a medium yakult is almost 7 dollars. That is so ridiculously expensive and for a not even full cup!? I used to love this place but now I'm just annoyed. I'll frequent my usual boba shops
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-01-09,4.0,"The place very clean and although there's a line, the wait isn't long. I think the main reason is because the staffs are efficient and makes the drink pretty fast. I saw a sign which says Brandy milk tea and Brandy Hot Chocolate so I wanted to try the milk tea. That's right, It's Brandy - the alcohol lol. It says it will consist of 0.5% alcohol so not too bad. For these two drinks, they only have it for one size - medium and it must be hot. So I ordered the Brandy milk tea and when I start sipping my drink, I can really taste the Brandy. It didn't taste like it only consist of 0.5% alcohol but the good thing is I didnt really feel the alcohol (thank god since i was at work lol). The taste is pretty interesting and I would recommend to give it a try just for fun . The taste is not bad and it's pretty special. I may try the Brandy Chocolate next time."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-09-24,1.0,"Ordered myself a large green tea with aloe & noticed something else was floating in my drink. As I took a closer look, I was shocked to see I got an ""additional bonus topping"" - found this little bug floating in it. It is funny how as I was standing on line waiting to order, a lady from the Department of Health made a surprise visit & headed back behind the counter. Looks like I won't be going back to this place again, unless you like to get an ""additional bonus topping""!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-06-24,4.0,"My Go-To bubbletea place near work. 

Whenever I'm at work and I crave bubbletea, I would visit Coco. For the past two visits , I have ordered the lava pearl latte! The drink is pretty good and flavorful. 

However, for anyone who needs to head back to their desk ASAP, this drink may not be for you. When the batch of tapioca runs out, you would need to wait 10-15 minutes for the next batch as it is made fresh. 

Overall, it's a great place to get bubbletea! 

Food insta: Fooodies.United w/ 3 o's"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-01-23,5.0,"I have been a regular since they opened. Great authentic tea they brew at the store. They have a variety of tea choices, toppings and also slushes.

Some people like fruity teas with sweet toppings like bubbles and jellies but I usually go for plain black milk tea. Classic is the best to me. If I want a bit of twist to it, they started this salted foam that is fantastic that I usually put on top of my milk tea. It may give a bit of oil things later on top but it is similar to whip cream but less creamier. 

They always have friendly service here so although I think it's a bit expensive, I keep on coming back."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2018-08-11,5.0,The juice here is always good and they give an adequate amount of fresh boba. There's really no point in me leaving a review but I felt obliged to because the guy working this past Thursday (08/09) was literally the nicest person ever. It was a super hot day and a couple of people came in to ask if they sold water- the guy said no but still went to fill up a large cup with ice and water. No questions asked. Yes I know this is a very minute act of kindness but it's NYC- pretty rare when everyone's in a rush and rude (holistically speaking)! I'm just glad they tipped him.
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2018-10-04,5.0,"Cute little shop! I got the jasmine milk tea with bubbles and the medium was perfect size. Wasn't too floral like most jasmine teas

You can easily customize the sweetness and amount of ice they add as well. 
It was pretty busy when I was in there but the staff got drinks out very quickly!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-06-25,4.0,"Good experience! Came here after work; will definitely be coming back. 

Service is prompt and quality is pretty good; was happy with that. I got a passion fruit black tea with grass jelly, 50% sugar, and less ice; taste of the tea was good, and the grass jelly very much did not disappoint. 

If you're looking for a date spot, this should be a decent one; they have some seating, and I saw a really cute couple in there. Just some boba on your way to Grand Central? Here's good as well; they'll get you your boba consistently and quickly. 

The only reason I'm leaving 4 instead of 5 is that I was disappointed that their menu of fruit tea was less extensive than those of the Coco's in China; I've missed that. Still better than most boba places though; check it out!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2020-02-26,1.0,Straws are too small for the bubbles?
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-02-02,5.0,I was walking around the block one day and stumbled across this cute little tea/slushy bar.  The logo itself definitely attracted my attention.  I got myself a taro boba tea and can I say?? It was delicious! The staff there were friendly as well. I would love to go back and try the other stuff on the menu.
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-04-26,5.0,"The workers there are super friendly and fast!!! My order was ready before I even finished paying. The bubble tea (reg.) is really good and isn't too bitter or too sweet. Although there aren't a lot of tables to work on, there is a good amount of seating. Again, the workers are really friendly and nice!!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2018-06-08,5.0,"Delicious bubble tea! I only wish they used real passion fruit like they do in Asia. Great flavor even without it though 

My favorite bubbles of all time! Bouncy, just the right amount of chewiness and sweet flavor"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-09-15,5.0,"This is my go to bubble tea place, and though it's a little far from my house, I would say the reward for my journey makes it worth it. Though the store is small, there's a little seating and the options are good. They also have never messed up my drink, and I've been numerous times (and I always order something different). Good customer service and your drink is made pretty quick."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-08-08,1.0,"Staff is friendly but the products are terrible. Just paid $7 for something called a berry sparkle which is really sprite, water, ice and some fruit confit = disgusting. This place is basically a sugar water factory pumping artificial sweeteners, syrups, and sugars into your drinks. 

There is absolutely nothing beneficial about adding boba (tapioca) to your drinks. It's a scam. If anything, it contributes to weight gain."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2018-06-15,4.0,"I wish they would stop raising the prices, because pretty soon I won't be able to afford to have one a week. Other than that, Coco is definitely my go to bubble tea place. 

I like the 2 ladies and passion fruit green tea. Ordering with no sugar is the right amount of sugar, as the sweetness of the tapioca offsets the regular tea. 

Another things I have to commend them for is their speed and efficiency. It can get busy, but never end up just waiting."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-02-27,5.0,"My milk tea was delicious, I was able to control the sweetness and that was a shocker! No other tea place has ever asked me that and I was pleased. Thank y'all!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2018-12-26,5.0,"Haven't left a review in a while but I've been to Coco so many times I felt obligated to :)

They make the drinks super duper fast and it always tastes great. If they mess up the order, which sometimes happens with new staff, they'll remake it immediately if you just let them know. 

My absolute favs are 1) the Cloud Black Tea with bubbles - 50% sugar, less ice, less bubbles - and 2) Grapefruit Yakult with lychee jellies - 30% sugar, less ice. Both super yummy. The Cloud Black Tea is a newer item, basically plain black tea with a layer of whipped cream on top that you shake to integrate before you drink. Basically it tastes like a milk tea but silkier, so good!!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2018-10-10,5.0,In a beautiful day like this I went with my boyfriend to grab tea here cuz I love bubble tea. I got ginger tea with bubble in it and it was good as always. My boyfriend for peach tea which was also great. This place is small but very spacious cuz it is not busy nor crowded. They have varieties of tea and the prices are manhattan prices. Good for hot summer days when you are tired and thirsty go grab some tea.
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2018-09-21,4.0,"If your near grand central this is your place to get some bubble tea. It's small inside, but the staff is on point. They'll get your drinks made in record speed to have you on your merry way!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2019-01-04,5.0,"My hot boba milk tea fantasties have been fulfilled!!!! I only  knew a handful of places that served hot milk tea so I was in heaven when I saw this on the menu. It was served in a coffee cup but sealed on top so I could drink It like regular boba. It was the perfect drink for the cold Winter weather!!!! The service was quick and the boba was delicious. My friend got it with grass jelly instead of boba, which I tried and was also good.....Will definitely be back!!!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2018-06-03,4.0,"Classic bubble milk tea, with pudding. Around $5.
Quiet place and spacious. great taste, two thumbs up."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2018-01-13,4.0,"Not the best milk tea and boba I have ever had, but still good enough to fulfill my boba cravings while in NYC. Staff was friendly and they made my drink super fast! They also don't load my milk tea with a bunch of ice so it wouldn't taste watered down after a while - I appreciate that. This location is in a great spot near Grand Central Station which is where I was coming from. Their cups are also so cute and designed to appear taller than usual."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2018-10-12,4.0,"During the time I came here, their boba was a tad over sweet but it made the taro milk tea still enjoyable. They use the taro milk tea powder that I really like- good quality kind. Would definitely come back. One of my favorite boba tea franchises."
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2016-07-11,5.0,"One of the best bubble tea spots in NYC! I usually get the taro tea, their best seller (a milk based tea with the tapioca bubbles). 

Today, I decided to try the mango green tea with the tapioca bubbles ($4 for a medium + $.50 for the bubbles added). So refreshing and yummy! Perfect for a nice hot day!"
932,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-2,2018-07-07,5.0,"I've been a big fan of the CoCo chain ever since I tried it in Manila. They have great quality boba and a huge variety of drink flavors! From classic milk tea to Yakult, there's something for everyone. 

I tried the Hoji milk tea at this location and loved its roasted flavor. It might be limited edition but I highly recommend it if available!  Service was quick and friendly even though the small shop had a high influx of new customers."
933,2beans-new-york,2019-12-23,5.0,"Needed good wifi, a space to work out of, and a cup of coffee & this place was it! Service was great, never with a side eye or snarkiness... Love it."
933,2beans-new-york,2019-08-30,5.0,"My favorite place in the city, conveniently located close to grand central. I wish they didnt close so early but I love stopping by here for a quick oat snack, a mocha, or some pastries. Although they have changed the food and seating a lot. I used to love when they had different chocolates out for display because I used to take some home for my family. And they were all different flavors. But either way its a great cafe to spend time with friends for a quick drink and bite."
933,2beans-new-york,2018-07-06,5.0,"I had the chance to try this 2Beans location in midtown while catching up with a friend who was visiting the city. I've walked by it a handful of times but never had the opportunity to step inside until this experience. I was always enticed by the idea that they served coffee beverages at what looked like a typical bar seating arrangement. Regardless, I took the chance and told my friend to meet me there even though it was my first time trying out the spot. I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed.

My friend and I walked in around 5:45 PM on a Thursday afternoon. It was fairly dead at the bar on their first floor and while we were there only one other party ended up walking into the space. They also had an interesting set up in which they allowed us to sit at the bar and order our drinks there before paying for them. This was definitely a more casual bar-esq setting than most coffee shops in the city claim to be.

My friend and I both ordered their ice coffee ($4.45) which was presented to us on a tray with accompanying water and a small chocolate. So surprising! It's definitely the small things that count at restaurants and cafes and even though this wasn't too monumental of a gesture it definitely was appreciated.

The space itself is actually two floors with a small main bar on the first and additional seating on the second. They have an array of coffee products placed throughout the first floor that you're able to buy as well.

The service was great here too! The barista's were extremely friendly and didn't hesitate to answer any questions we had. I'd definitely recommend the spot if you're looking for a more unique place to grab coffee with a friend at. They also have alcoholic beverages that you can order as well if you're in the mood for something with a little bit more kick than your average cup of joe."
933,2beans-new-york,2019-01-11,5.0,"This is a great spot to gather for a business meeting or a casual cup of coffee before you catch your train. I came here prior to catching a train and had a very pleasant experience. The lady at the counter was very friendly and allowed me to sample some of their menu items. I ended up getting the sipping chocolate and a banana muffin. Both were fresh and warm, great for a cold day!"
933,2beans-new-york,2019-12-17,5.0,"My personal bucket list included getting some hot chocolate during the winter time in NYC.  Boyfriend and I were on the way to ice skate in Bryant Park and stopped by for a hot drink to sip on while we walked there... I ordered the ""sipping chocolate,"" which is basically their version of hot chocolate.  Now, this isn't your typical hot chocolate powder mix that's incorporated into a cup of steaming milk, or worse, hot water.  No, this is a sublime experience... you are literally just sipping on melted chocolate.  I should have known it would be delicious, because when you walk in, you'll see glass cases of delicately made chocolates, which almost looks like gems.  Chocolate shops don't play around... especially when it comes to hot chocolate.  The drink itself was so luscious, rich, and warming.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any marshmallows available for me to have with it, but maybe that was better... so that I could appreciate the chocolate in this decadent form."
933,2beans-new-york,2019-08-28,5.0,"Amazing atmosphere
Took an espresso with ritual app, and expect(as usual) the worth, but so far this is my beat experience with coffee shops in New York. 
Perfect crema, perfectly thick espresso with nice aftertaste. Most important thing (attention readers) - it's non acidic at all. I know that usually in order to lower the price of a beverage owners using cheap coffee beans or over-roast it. 
In this case everything was just perfect(no shaking hands or twitchy eye ). Couldn't start my morning better 
Thank you, barista-girl and cashier-girl 
Wish you to have only smiley costumers today 
You made my day"
933,2beans-new-york,2019-07-08,4.0,"I was super excited when I got here, I've been wanting to try 2beans for a while and it's one of the few places in midtown with a decent amount of seating so it seemed like I could work/study while enjoying a hot cocoa.
Anyway, walked in, and there was space both downstairs and upstairs so I decided to go up. I ordered three pastries and a piece of chocolate (for home) and a hot chocolate to enjoy, and headed upstairs to the mezzanine. I was surprised my hot cocoa was in a cup and not in the ceramic like it was in so many yelp photos, but no worries. Went up, tried my hot chocolate and saw that it was super sweet, so I left my stuff and went back down to ""water it down"" with a bit of milk. While I had been gone for ten seconds, one of the staff had put two menus on my table and told me the second floor is table service only. She implied I needed to buy something else. I told her that I didn't see the sign that was apparently near the stairs (instead of, I dunno, near the entrance so I could see it before I ordered?). I also emphasized that I'd bought at least $15-20 worth of goods and that I'd be careful next time.
I'll be back because the overall atmosphere is nice, but it was a little irritating to be honest. I'm really great about following directions and noting details like this in advance, so I'm a little disappointed by the direction, but I'll just remember for next time. Otherwise the rest of the staff were really nice.
-1 for the cavity-in-liquid-form hot chocolate and for the poorly placed sign re: ""table service only"" by the dark stairs out of sight of the register."
933,2beans-new-york,2019-06-10,4.0,"Nice little coffee shop tucked out of the way that used to be my afternoon escape. Great space to interact -- my favorite  was a sunny little nook, where I could sip coffee and have the free little chocolate with my girl. It's sitting in a great location, too, without tons of traffic--auto or pedestrian--off if what we called the ""hottest block in Manhattan,"" owing to the lack of buildings that would normally block the sun.

In winter, the upstairs was a haven, and the wine special was decent. They've redone the layout downstairs to make more space for seating and less for chocolate, but they still have a decent selection. Oh--and the coffee is great!"
933,2beans-new-york,2019-09-18,2.0,"Decent coffee, but service is poor and wait staff are pretty rude :("
933,2beans-new-york,2019-08-23,3.0,"I came here on a Friday around 1PM. It was pretty quiet, but once 2PM hit, tons of people came in and the place became very loud. There is an upstairs area that is great for working (has tables and chairs and free wi-fi). The only issue is... lots of people are holding meetings, chatting it up with friends. Not a great place to get work done if you're looking for a semi-quiet area. 

The matcha latte was very good and the croissant was decent (likely would have been better in the morning). Together it cost $9, which is typical of NYC prices."
933,2beans-new-york,2017-12-06,5.0,"Alex the Goddess of how to make you feel like your the only girl in the world, barista is so en pointe! 

Heyyyy Lavona....How you doin'? Love yo' nails


For presentations alone I'd give 2Beans five stars. I am a sucker for all things orderly and clean and this place reeks of OCD notes. The extensive chocolate collection is impressive and museum worthy in it's own right.

There is counter service and drinks are delivered on a silver tray with a share of toffee milk chocolate and a shot of water. They serve up NY accents as if we're traveling the world right from our seats and I applaud the diversity #2beans got it going on... for real dough!

They're located on the south side of Grand Central Station, behind Pershing Square...Pssst... I'm not 109% certain it's the south side I just like sounding like I know. Makes me feel like a rogue news reporter, hear what I'm saying?

Enjoy the Honey & Cinnamon Latte, on me. Tell 'em to put it on my tab!

Yours,

933,2beans-new-york,2018-01-13,4.0,"Absolutely amazing selection of chocolates! Literally 5 bookcases full of small batch chocolate from all over the world.  Worth a visit for any sweet tooth.  

Giving 4/5 stars only because they don't have coconut milk at the cafe (soy & almond taste like chalk!)"
933,2beans-new-york,2018-11-10,3.0,"Beautifully presented latte in a nice white mug with little dark chocolate. However the taste was lacking. Also, on Saturday, when we visited, there was no milk out if you need to add extra. The place is beautiful with nice tables alongside the wall, by the windows and in upstairs area."
933,2beans-new-york,2016-10-27,5.0,"We stopped by here to get world famous bean-to-bar chocolate that we never tried.

Trustworthy  his taste and knowledge.
My client from Japan also love here, and it's proved must go place in the city"
933,2beans-new-york,2019-02-01,5.0,"I love this place, they have a nice selection of wine and the server Amanda is really nice and friendly."
933,2beans-new-york,2016-06-08,4.0,"After a morning at Starbucks, I decided to have a change of scenery and moved down the street from the mainstream to a nice cafe recommended by my sister's manager. 2Beans not only specializes in coffee, but also in chocolates. Here to study and grab a coffee? Why not also get a few chocolates? Many people were here for meetings or just meeting up on a date.

There are no outlets upstairs, which meant my time would be cut short when my computer died.  There's quite a bit of seating upstairs, while there is nearly no seating downstairs. You aren't allowed to use your laptop at the bar counter, which means there are only two tables you can use your laptop.

I placed an order of a rosewater latte with the server that took so long, that eventually, she also brought me a complimentary raspberry dessert to make up for the slow service. It was pretty nice of her, although I wasn't a huge fan of the cake. I did enjoy the complimentary 2Beans chocolate that each beverage came with. 

The rosewater latte was tasty, although as others have mentioned, the rosewater is pretty subtle. But I'm glad, because I'm sure that a strong rose flavor may have come across as soapy. I stayed for a couple of hours, so I ended up ordering a cappuccino, as well. 

Although 2Beans isn't your usual Starbucks atmosphere, busy working remote kind of stop, it's still a change of pace, especially if you're stopping in for more than just studying or grinding out some work."
933,2beans-new-york,2016-04-24,5.0,"A hidden gem near Grand Central Terminal! It is a chocolate shop with a coffee bar. It is not your everyday fast-paced take out coffee spot. Take-out is an option is available but if you have some time to spare, take a seat and let the barista take care of you. 

Whether it is before work or after work, I like to stop by 2Beans for a cup of latte. I tried a number of different ones but here are my favorites - Lavender Mint Latte, Matcha Latte, and the Rosewater Latte.

Lavender Mint Latte has a nice, gentle floral aroma with a mint following. It has just the perfect amount of sweetness. I love to have this drink when I am stressing out at work, it helps calm my mind down.

Matcha Latte. It uses Ito En's matcha powder, a Japanese tea brand. Its bitter-sweetness is just the perfect combination for my taste buds.

Rosewater Latte. This is probably my ultimate favorite drink here - hot or iced. Perfect amount of fruity sweetness for my taste buds. A must-try! 

There are coffee bar seats and tables located in the back. If you want table service, you may go upstairs. Either way, you are enjoying some real good drinks here!"
933,2beans-new-york,2018-01-13,4.0,"This place is clean, vibrant, interesting, and bigger than it seems. I ordered a carrot cake, which wasn't too bad, and a matcha latte. The matcha latte is very strong compared to what I am used to, but otherwise, this isn't a bad place to go to.

I will say that this place is a bit pricier than a Starbucks, but it has an elegant feel to the location. This is a great spot for meetups and a place to relax and chill. It seems like large groups of people like to come here to relax and hang out with other people, since there were a bunch of people with name tags were pretty much taking over most of the top floor.

Ultimately, this place is a spot that is definitely worth to try out!"
933,2beans-new-york,2018-01-15,5.0,"This is one of our favorite coffee places in Nyc. They have a great area upstairs to read your newspapers or just to hang out and chat. You will see lots of people holding meetings, like when we were there a group of kids that speaks mandarin were there. 
They are great for lattes, coffee, chocolates huge variety of chocolates to enjoy or take with you. And they carry the great coffee illy. It's very well located near grand central station and it's very cozy."
933,2beans-new-york,2017-04-30,4.0,"2Beans is both a chocolate/sweets/coffee store as well as a small cafe upstairs that serves everything.

I came here last week for the first time because my mom had a Living Social coupon for two glasses of wine, a chocolate sampler, and a $5 gift card. We had a great time and I would definitely return if we got that deal again -- it's on the pricey side without a discount, but it's a cute place in an otherwise pretty corporate neighborhood.

If you do the Living Social coupon, you can choose glasses of any white/red/rose wine and you get a chocolate sampler, which is five pieces for the two people to split. They asked if we had any allergies, and since we didn't, they brought us their classic sampler (chocolates with hazelnut, ginger, passion fruit, etc.), as well as a knife so that we could split ones that we both wanted to try. They were delicious!

The chocolate selection downstairs is awesome -- a huge cabinet full of truffles in super unique flavors as well as a long wall with various types of interesting bars of chocolates, some $3 and some $20 or more. This is a great place to go if you're looking for a little present for a chocolate lover, a chocolate stocking stuffer, etc. Wide range of brands and price points -- cheapest is 2Beans brand chocolate bars, which are just under $3 each.

Upstairs is their cafe area with waiter service. We were there at 6pm on a weekday (they close at 7pm), it was about half full, and service was fast."
933,2beans-new-york,2017-03-23,4.0,Dangerous place for chocolate lovers.  Their hot chocolate is literally like a cup of melted chocolate.   Maze of cacao products line the walls of this tiny cafe.  I'm in love.
933,2beans-new-york,2018-01-06,4.0,Fancy and  friendly place with great selection of coffee and chocolate. Not as crowded today probably because of the cold but seems to be a good cozy place to hang out and enjoy.
933,2beans-new-york,2017-07-20,4.0,"Very nice cafe with free wifi. Clean, new interior and it seems suitable for casual meeting. I like the location as a cafe very much but the upstairs space is too busy and loud. 
Chocolates are constantly good here, recommended for gifts :) 
They have many good chocolate drinks, gelato, pastries. 
They also have morning pairing (like croissant and drink), afternoon pairing(like sandwich and drink) and evening pairing(chocolate samplers and wine) at affordable price. 
I should come back to try the wine and chocolate pairing...!!"
933,2beans-new-york,2014-07-20,4.0,"As part of my commute home, I've walked past 2beans barely noticing what it was until one day I looked closer and saw it was a cafe, so I decided to try it.

When I walked in I knew this place was inappropriately named as their abundant chocolate selections take up nearly half the 1st floor!  I'm thinking to myself...get ready for something tasty.

I decided to forgo the retail store section which is filled with many different chocolate bars, chocolate pastries, and chocolate candies, and head to the cafe section.


I ordered a regular large cup of coffee and one of the multitude of delicious looking fresh pastries in the form of a nutella tart.

Shockingly I've never tasted illy coffee and after tasting it I couldn't help but be a little sad in realizing what I was missing for most of my life.  It was great coffee; a very nice mild soothing blend that calmed my caffeine cravings.

I had the nutella tart and it was an perfect accouplement to the illy coffee; not too sweet, nice outer crust, and just large enough to satisfy most people.


A really nice touch as part of the eat-in service is that 2beans supplies a nice complimentary cinnamon crumble bar and a small glass of water with orders.  The water really helps clear your palette after a cup of coffee; something I do normally anyways.


Speaking of the eat-in service, you have the choice of eating at the ""bar"" counter or going to the 2nd floor.  I suggest the 2nd floor as it was nicely decorated in simple modern comfy furniture (love-seats and comfy couches) and neutral colors; think of it as an upscale IKEA look.


Prices weren't too bad considering 2beans is located in midtown Manhattan adjacent to many financial and law firms.  2beans has plenty of competition though considering the prolific number of cafes and Starbucks in the area (yes, hedge fund gurus and attorneys crave caffeine)."
933,2beans-new-york,2014-06-30,4.0,"ADORABLE coffee shop that seems out of place for midtown (which i associate with chain restaurants and nothing special)... its ALL OF THE FOLLOWING: a chocolate shop, a convenience store, and a coffee counter with a quiet open seating area upstairs equipped with couches, tables, and fireplace

if you stay to enjoy your drink, they serve your drink on a tray with a shot of palate cleansing water PLUS a piece of 2beans chocolate (Mine was dark 72%) MMmm
---iced/hot coffee: standard

i'd def come back to study or catch up with a friend!!

NOTE: FREE soy milk at the counter!"
933,2beans-new-york,2016-05-06,4.0,"Probably 2Beans is a bit lack of the hipster feeling that I was generally looking for in a typical coffee shop; however the great coffee selection really made that up.

Two things on menu interested me the most - lavender mint latte and rosewater, and I tried the latter. Still thought the vanilla flavor dominated the rose, which actually I was looking for a bit more. 

Lots of seating areas on the second floor, and good for grabbing some snacks."
933,2beans-new-york,2016-10-20,5.0,"They made a coffee-chocolate hybrid store, which interesting to look at. A relatively mild hot chocolate based makes the pumpkin flavor of the pumpkin hot chocolate stand out."
933,2beans-new-york,2017-10-11,4.0,"Clean, bright, spacious with the upstairs space. A great place to meet near Grand Central. I've had the hot chocolate, which is basically a liquified bar of dark and rich chocolate (i.e. awesome). Comes with a glass of water, which is essential to wash it down."
933,2beans-new-york,2016-04-23,5.0,"What a BRILLIANT idea.
2Beans combines my two favorite things, coffee and chocolate, in one spot.
There's a full coffee bar, plus a massive selection of unique chocolates (spicy, bacon, banana, etc).
You can get coffee to go or there's a full service area upstairs with seating.
I opted for a to go iced coffee, which was delicious and reasonably priced.
I can't wait to return."
933,2beans-new-york,2018-02-06,5.0,"Great atmosphere, staff is very friendly!  I had the matcha latte with almond milk, it was really good!"
933,2beans-new-york,2016-03-03,5.0,"Update 3/4/16 
This morning when I came in to purchase chocolate I met the operations manager and he was really nice. I found everything I was looking for! Again great service. Will be back for more goodies. 


Really cute chocolate bar right by grand central terminal. Lots of chocolate to choose from. Very friendly staff. Can be overwhelming. Price ranges."
933,2beans-new-york,2018-02-13,4.0,"Came here to study with my friend; there's an upstairs seating area. It's table service; so I ordered a drip coffee (yay for illy) which was mmm and a brownie. Skip the brownie though...I found it too oily and the texture weird. Service and cafe itself was nice--they sell other great drink options and chocolates. However, it got loud really quick so I just recommend this as a place to hang out. Also, wifi is limited and then they charge you."
933,2beans-new-york,2019-03-12,5.0,Right off the plane-took a bus to Grand Central Station and found this gem for breakfast. Really quick service! Coffee was AMAZING. Staff polite and made sure I got dairy free items. Lox- defiantly recommend. It's beautiful inside!
933,2beans-new-york,2017-04-10,5.0,My favorite coffee spot in the am.  The girls are fabulous!  Alex and Maral are so attentive and just the best!!  They always put a smiley face in my capuchino!  Ask for Alex and a happy face when you get here! You will love being pampered - a great place to meet for coffee!  Ahhhhh and dont forget to ask for a glass of wine in the pm!
933,2beans-new-york,2017-07-03,5.0,"This has good coffee and some decent wines, it has a good coffee bar downstairs and nice lounge upstairs. Open kind of late as well and Saturday's."
933,2beans-new-york,2017-03-15,5.0,"This is truly a GREAT chocolate store! They not only have a wide selection of chocolate bars, and chocolate covered items (pretzels, nuts, etc) but their chocolate truffles are always changing! I've tried green tea truffles, champagne, caramel and even fruity ones here. I used to come with my boyfriend every week for a few months to try the new varieties! I've also purchased some hot chocolate here which is my family's new favorite!

The espresso bar upstairs is also lovely. You can order a delicious hot chocolate (really very decadent) or a nice espresso drink to have with your chocolates. Their selection of teas is also lovely, with many imported teas and companies you've never heard of (mostly swiss and european). Really very delicious on all fronts!

A must-try for tourists, sweet-lovers and New Yorkers!"
933,2beans-new-york,2019-02-27,5.0,Don't just come and buy a coffee to go... walk up stair sit down and enjoy your coffee... very friendly and great staff...
933,2beans-new-york,2016-12-16,4.0,"One day I was around Park Ave and stumbled upon this chocolate/coffee shop, and I absolutely loved it! I thought it was like a Starbucks kinda coffee shop where you order your coffee and serve yourself, but when the cashier asked me if it was for here or to go, I said, ""For here."" Then, I found out there was a whole other floor above this shop. It has a clean, modern layout with a variety of table sizes and chairs. Some seats were comfy, cushiony sofas, but I opted for a seat against the ledge and ordered a macchiato while I studied my GRE. 

Surprisingly, there were quite a large flow sitting in around 7/8am. Many seemed like corporate workers with suits and ties while some looked like tourists or travelers as they had a carry on luggage. I mean 2Beans is conveniently located by Grand Central Terminal.

I ordered a macchiato that was served in a sleet, clear glass with a piece of chocolate. It was about $6 with tax and tip. I'd say it's a little more on the pricier side since (I think) coffee is about $4/5 on average in NYC. But the beautiful environment and attentive service definitely made it worthwhile."
933,2beans-new-york,2018-10-11,5.0,"In love with new concept/design, I feel like I'm in a European cafe...whether I'm grabbing my espresso at the standing high-tops or having a sit down cappuccino with a colleague, this is my go-to place for my caffeine fix. The change to For Five coffee was a good move, much better and smoother taste.  Also doesn't hurt to mention that the new jean apron/uniforms are super trendy and fun!"
933,2beans-new-york,2017-03-17,5.0,"Delicious!!!!!!! Great coffee, lovely aroma from all the goodies being made, and friendly staff. My boyfriend said he'd have to start buying my chocolate from there because I was googly-eyed at all of the goodness.... The coffee is strong, so if you're sensitive to caffeine later in the day like I am, go with the small (3 shots of expresso); I had it at 1pm and couldn't fall asleep until 12:45am... be warned! It's a really nice please and I'm excited to go back."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2020-02-21,5.0,"Never ever disappoints. I've been to other locations, but really like this one. It's really spacious and wasn't too busy when I came in. I tried the hazelnut flavor for the first time and REALLY REALLY enjoyed it. Love this place so much! And service is always remarkable, at every location. Very patient and happy staff members! 

Always a must to stop by after some dinner in the city."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2020-04-01,3.0,"Service: Great! I am so indecisive and it make is it so difficult to go to gelato shops and pick out flavors. There are so many I haven't tried before which made it even more difficult for me to pick. The people behind the counter were very sweet and let me sample anything that I wanted. They also let me know of their favorite flavor combinations to try out.

Food:
Dulce de Leche - Nice and sweet, I would have enjoyed some with a deeper flavor next time.

Stracciatella - Classic! You cant go wrong with this flavor.

Marcarpone & Fig - If you don't like fig, this is not for you! I had a sample without the fig and I liked it. I ordered this with the fig fragments in it and found that I do not like figs.

On to my next food adventure..."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2020-03-31,4.0,"Fino Alla Prossima Volta (Thank you Google translation). 

The staff was very efficient in getting through the long lines. Please be patient so that the staff is able to make you a pretty rose-shaped gelato.  

Definitely a high quality gelato spot with very unique flavors (vegan and vegetarian options). Plenty of seating towards the back of the store. Excellent service with patient & friendly staff. Pricey gelato but for the quality and taste of it, I'd say it's worth it. #treatyoself 

Highly recommend."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2020-03-28,4.0,"My boyfriend and I came here many times during our first New York trip, since it's very close to Times Square on 8th St. We love the beautiful presentation of the rose-shaped gelatos. When I came to New York alone, I decided to swing by here once during my last couple of days in New York for old time's sake, even though I wasn't supposed to eat sweets. Thank goodness for the nutrition facts sheet that they have up on the wall!

I indulged in a small gelato arranged into a rose on a cone, topped with a macaron right around when they were closing shop at midnight. I enjoyed every bite."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2020-01-09,4.0,"Gelato that reminds me of Italy. Finally real gelato found in the states. The hot chocolate is especially good also but a lil expensive. (7.00) 
Get the cone as they shape your flavor choices like flower and don't miss out on the macaroon on top."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-09-29,5.0,"If you come at the right time (when the line isn't crazy long) you're going to have a good ass time.

We dropped in on our way to Port Authority thinking we'd be in and out in a couple minutes. Nope. We missed our bus instead because we were dilly dallying.

First off, special shoutout to Sarah who helped us. She was so nice and friendly. It almost felt like we were hanging out with a friend. Because we were the last in line and there wasn't anyone behind us, she was kind enough to let my friend taste whatever she wanted to sample. Literally everything they have is great. It's like you're tasting the actual fruit. It's hard to recommend a flavor. They're all equally tasty. My personal favorite however was the caramel, or yogurt, or dulce de leche. LOL.

I loved it here so much, I came back the next day with my nephew. He of course loved it."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-10-11,5.0,"Of course I had to visit Amorino for the beautiful gelato roses I had been seeing on my instagram for years. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it and it did not disappoint!

The first thing you do when you get in line is choose your size of cup or cone and pay. You can still get the rose in a cup! I wish I had know that when I ordered, as I find cones to be generally messy. 

Then you get to look at all the available flavors and sample whatever you like. No matter what size you choose, you are allowed to pick however many flavors you want! I got the smallest size cone and I was still able to fit like 6 different flavors. The gelato artist didn't even bat an eyelash and I could have probably added more but I didn't want the flavors to clash.

It was fascinating to watch them build the rose petals from the gelato. My artist was very meticulous and I saw him discard petals over and over until he was able to make me a perfect flower. 

The gelato itself is also pretty delicious and there are a lot of flavors to choose from. Amorino is definitely worth checking out!"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-09-15,5.0,"The first time I had this gelato was in Italy so I was thrilled to see it in NYC! This is right in theTheater District. The decor is the same as Italy-modern with  wood accents to bring some warmth. Coffee and tea are available as well as pastries. The pastries looked good. There are several coffee variations including affogato. The real star is the gelato! It's creamy but light. I had the small with 3 flavors-vanilla, chocolate and amarena cherry. All were yummy! The amarena had cherries, the vanilla tasted tasted like it was made with vanilla bean and the chocolate was decadent! You can get a cone or cup. I highly recommend the cone because it's shaped like a flower! You can even add a macaroon!
The store was clean. There were some tables in the back. You go to the counter and pay. You order your flavors when it's being scooped. The line was long but moved fast. Highly recommend!!"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-08-26,5.0,"All the reviews are right this place was great.  Excellent service, good gelato and stylish.  It's really expensive and they don't give you a lot so probably bad if you have boys 10-18.  

But we loved it"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-09-17,4.0,"C'est magnifique!

Review of an Italian gelato place and I choose to start with a French phrase lol.

Got the classic sized amorino rose with 3 flavors and the macaroon- the works(description in the caption for attached photo).

Design is beautiful and it tastes good too. The only downside is that you gotta eat it quick, the rose melts pretty quickly.

9/10 would go back again!"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-08-28,5.0,"Simply amazing. 

You first pick your cup or cone size. Then you can choose as many flavors as you'd like..the most I saw was 4. You can also add a macaroon and chose the flavor of it, too!

I got the blueberry cheesecake, coffee and mint chocolate chip. My boyfriend got pistachio. They were all high-quality with amazing flavor. We added macaroons, which was a nice compliment.

The design of their cones is beautiful. I'm definitely coming back here next time I visit NYC. Great gelato!"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2020-01-14,5.0,"Came here for a sweet treat after seeing a broadway show. We were intrigued by the vegan and non-vegan options. 

My family and I ordered various gelatos, cookies, and cheesecakes. I had the vegan chocolate sorbet and it was excellent. Very rich, chocolatey, and creamy. I really enjoyed it. 

My mom had their regular chocolate + mint chocolate gelato and loved it as well! For a small and a classic size it came out to be around $13, so it is a little pricey but this is Times Square NYC after all."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-07-29,5.0,"Gelati and sorbetto arranged in a cute little flower on a cone complete with a macaron on top? Everything here is so instagrammable and for me, it was love at first sight. 

On the recommendation of a staff memeber, I got a large cone with tiramisu / caramel gelati and the coconut / mango sorbetto with a chocolate macaron on top.  The flavor profile was amazing; rich and decadent, yet light and fruity at the same time. I thoroughly enjoyed each lick, and the macaron on top was a nice treat too. 

Overall, my experience at Amorino Gelato was lovely, everybody in the NYC area has to give this place a try at least once in their life."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-08-04,4.0,"Amorino Gelato is a popular chain. There's one in Atlanta (Buckhead). I was a big fan of it. My friend never had it and she loves gelato so we stopped in.

I remember how beautiful the presentation is since they're all about making it so pretty like a flower.

You pay up front first and give the ticket to the gelato person. In Atlanta, it's pay after you get your gelato. Just like Atlanta, you could get as many samples as you want and flavors. I stuck to mint choco.

Service was great! Line is long too!! Bathroom needs a code to use!

159/2019"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-11-22,2.0,"I can't disagree more with most of the reviews here. 

I didn't like their gelato. It wasn't creamy, rich or flavorful. It was crumbling when scooped with the spoon. The dark chocolate was so weak it could have been frozen yogurt. A friend of mine left half inside his cup and it didn't fully melt until 40 minutes later... which simply should not happen. 

They may have multiple locations around the world, but their ""gelato"" is forgettable and outrageously expensive. Never again."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-05-27,5.0,"I came here once before many years ago (when I was in high school) and the memory of the rose shaped ice cream still remained with me, which is why I decided to come here again!

I got the small cone ($6) and they allow you to choose up to 2-3 different flavors to form the rose petals. I got the Lychee, Passionfruit, and Raspberry gelato and it was delicious.... seriously SO worth it because you never get sick of different flavors and it's so aesthetically pleasing!!

Line is long but it's worth waiting for-- trust me!"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-12-27,5.0,"Hallmark of good gelato is that it doesn't weigh you down and you are off to finding the next good one. Creamy light natural flavors with very less sugar. Pistachio and vanilla was the best. The cone one is a gimmick like a rose, but get the cup and enjoy mixing the flavors together"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-12-21,5.0,"Came to to try out gelato in strawberry, basil, and mango flavor. Topped with macaron. It was great and I would recommend coming here."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-06-22,4.0,"I would have given 5 stars but here's why I deducted 1 star: service sucked. The lady at the cash register was rude. And... I ordered the hazelnut gelato, which wasn't enough for my scoop but the lady serving the gelato couldn't care less and gave me a half served cone. I was too tired to complain. 

The gelato itself was AMAZINGGGGGGG.. I got the mango one and hazelnut one.. both were sooooo good!! And the presentation was cute! 

The pic I attach is not what I was served but one that my friend was."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-11-12,5.0,I love this place with all my heart. I once reached a point where I'd get Amorino AT LEAST once a week. I get the cone with 5-6 flavors because they have no limit on the number of flavors you can get for the same price!
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-10-12,5.0,"This was the perfect end of my night. 

When my party and I arrived there was no line which allowed hs a few seconds to walk through and check out all the flavors. You have to walk into the restaurant to order at the cashier first ( a mistake many people made). After ordering you get a receipt to give to another staff member who will put the order together. The gelato flowers are definitely the main dish here. They recommend you get 2-3 flavors minimum for the flower. Since I got a small cone I got 3 flavors. I would suggest 3 for aesthetics lol. It was beyond delicious. Especially the macaroon!!!! I wish I got a case of the macaroons!"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-12-02,4.0,"This place is a hidden gem with affordable after dinner sweet bites. They offer a variety of flavors and when you get a cone, they will place your second flavor to look like petals of a flower. For a kids cone, you can try two flavors. So affordable for what you get and the quality of the gelato."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-03-14,2.0,"I prefer Danmarino to Amorino and so should you. Even if you don't like Dolphins. Wait, no, everyone likes Dolphins. I mean The Miami Dolphins. Right. Not even people in Miami like those Dolphins now do they.

Probably the most overpriced overrated gelato shop in the world. This isn't real Italian gelato but just some American knock off and they're all about Instagram and the cute heart-shaped whatever to post in your pictures, while the product itself is really mediocre...

And the reason people love it so much is because people just cannot tell the difference. If you were Italian you'd get it. You're not, so you don't. Not if you like Amorino, anyway.

If you can't tell the difference between gelato and ice cream and good stuff and bad stuff you probably shouldn't be on Yelp - but that's what Yelp is - it gives everybody a voice and that's why this place comes across as really popular when it's really crap."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-03-20,5.0,"What's there not to like about this shop? NOTHING! 

This is one of THE best gelato shops I've ever been to. First, the vibe: the inside is bright and very welcoming. When you walk in, the gelato and sorbet cases are on the right and there are about 8-ish tables in the shop. Most of the tables seat 2-3 people, but a lot of people just take out their gelato anyways. 

The gelato and sorbet: it's AMAZING. The presentation is just so cute! If you get your gelato in a cone, they'll make it in a rose shape and you can add a macaron on top. You can even get three different flavors! I got organic chocolate sorbet, coffee gelato, and coconut gelato with a vanilla macaron for mine and all flavors were unique and flavorful. They aren't too overpoweringly sweet either. I love this place :D"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-11-17,3.0,Average. Tasted more like ice cream than galeto. The waiter was not helpful and not patient. The flower shape looked so average.
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-05-08,5.0,"Stopped in to try their latte on my way to work. This latte was one of the worst I think I've tried thus far. It's got an odd nutty flavor. And the foam was disappointing too. It's nice they have milk alternatives; I ordered an almond milk latte. The employee then told me as she was making it that they were out of almond milk but she can use soy milk. Not my preference but tried it anyway. Great menu opt I will stop back in to update my review, but I certainly will not order a latte again. I'll give their gelato a try.

UPDATE 5-7-19 three star latte but five star gelato!!
Stopped in before work to try their gelato. There was a line but it moves pretty quickly. Ordered a medium cone gelato rose. I love that you can choose unlimited flavors and they all sound soooo good!! The medium cone gelato total with tax was $7.35. It's a bit pricey but worth it for how delicious the gelato is. And I love that the cone is not that sweet. It perfectly compliments the gelato. I ordered mine without the macaron. The flavors I ordered were lychee, mascarpone and fig, and the blueberry cheesecake. They all went well together and each one was delicious! As far as American gelato goes. :)   They filled the cone nicely with the lychee one too. I'll be back to try more flavors and bring my boyfriend. Excellent!"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-08-13,4.0,"Delicious gelato. When it comes down to ice cream or gelato, I'm team gelato. The Stracciatella flavor was decadent. The coffee flavor was really good as well. The consistency was perfect. Highly recommend Amorino for quality gelato."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2020-03-02,5.0,"Loved it. They have a very nice variety of gelato and ice cream. Gelato was delicious and the ambiance was nice. They make beautiful roses made of ice cream when you get it on a cone. Seating was comfortable. My favorite flavor from the ones I tried was the mango sorbet, it was sooo good."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-07-30,4.0,"Rolled over after dinner at Ippudo, it was packed! Prepare to wait for a long time, line was and the door and wound around the store. But it was worth it, gelato was satisfying and who doesn't love the grammable flower cones. The macaroon was really fresh too. All the gelato I got was delicious. I (real talk) should probably stay away, it's dangerously good. The cone was huge, the flower shape though beautiful, was very messy. I had to throw away some of it because my hands couldn't take the dribble. I did have an issue with the bathrooms, they were kinda nasty... maybe clean more often with the amount of customers coming in after dinner."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-09-07,5.0,"While waking down the Manhattan streets with friends , saw this shop in side and the way it was looking and people waiting in line felt like give a try. And I must say it's good I stop by. It's one of the best gelato I had. It's good , different and natural ingredients . I must say you should give a try.  Lot of flavors and choices to make."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-09-09,4.0,Finally got to check this off my list! It was good! And obvi pretty but the price at whopping $11 hmmm more like try it once and move on.
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2020-01-23,5.0,"Went here yesterday after dinner with a friend. The servers were so nice and the gelatos were amazing. They have macaroons too and those were amazing! They have so many options and flavors. I got the coffee, chocolate hazelnut and the blueberry cheesecake flavors. I'll definitely be coming back for the gelatos or their italian hot chocolate!"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-01-01,4.0,"Just like their other locations, great quality gelato, nice presentation and the service is very individualized and attentive, despite being busy.
As a vegan, I love the sorbet options. I always recommend chocolate sorbets because most gelato places do a very creamy, naturally dairy free dessert.
All of the fruit flavors were good, but it does get sweet after a while so I would need to share it."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2020-01-25,5.0,"My family and I went here after a night in the city. We had mint chocolate gelato, coffee, macaron, and strawberry sorbet drink. 

Each of us really enjoyed what we had. My son eats macaroons a lot and he said these were some of his favorites. 

There were many flavors that looked good. Next time I'm in Times Square, I will definitely come back here. They had a blueberry cheesecake flavor that looked amazing!"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-08-18,5.0,"On a recommendation we stopped in to have a cool treat on a hot humid day. With refreshing gelato and amazing Sorbetto you can relax, unwind and reboot before facing the busy streets of NY. The raspberry paired with the lime and basil was divine and a perfect stop on our weekend away."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2020-01-02,5.0,This place is a full experience. The ice cream sitting on top of the cone forms a beautiful open rose. You can mix up to 3 flavors in a small ice cream cup. If you enjoy caffeine I strongly recommend the expresso frappe! Service was welcoming and plenty of indoor seating. I can't wait to visit again and try the rest of their flavors.
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2020-02-03,1.0,"Tastes more like ice milk not even ice cream let alone gelato. Also the temperature was too cold for gelato so it was rock hard and not what you expect for gelato. There were four employees and they seemed more interested in talking to each other, doing their hair, checking their phones, eating the gelato and drinking the coffee they helped themselves to from the espresso machine. When I complained about the consistency and taste of the gelato, they barely acknowledged me nor did they apologize. Finally, after using their restroom, they chastised their patrons, blaming them for any paper on the floor, while it was clearly in need of being cleaned. The number of public health violations including the employee eating gelato, drinking coffee and then not changing her gloves, the  unsanitary bathrooms and unprofessional staff, combined with the awful ""gelato"" lead me to one star."
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2018-12-26,5.0,"I finally tried Amorino!! 
Boxing day 7:15pm less than 10ppl wait 

You order the size cup or cone before choosing flavors. I like how cup or cone is the same price. They make such pretty roses. Pretty sure you can order as many flavors as you want but I'd say 8-10 is like max where they can give you one petal per flavor plus a center. Small cone is quite sufficient imo $5.5 + tax = $5.99
Lines can get long cuz the servers take a new scoop whenever they scoop a petal even from the same flavor. They take their time to fit a lot and make it look pretty despite your tiny cone!! 

I got four flavors: hazelnut, Amorino chocolate, coconut, passionfruit 
I was wondering about tiramisu and lime and lemon and mandarin orange too 

Hazelnut 
No I didn't want nutella flavor so didn't go for chocolate hazelnut. I like eating the nut inside Ferrero Rocher so I know I'll like hazelnut. Turns out I liked this the LEAST. It did have the earthy nut flavor but it was TOO sweet. This flavor stuck to me the most, this is what my burps smelled like afterwards 
I know this is gelato but I think it'd taste better creamier, someone make hazelnut ice cream? 

Coconut 
I like yet I kinda don't like the chunky bits. Maybe it was too much?? I still liked it for its overpoweringness. It went well with the chocolate when I ate it together.

Amorino chocolate. 
Originally I wanted the Ecuador chocolate. I didn't know the difference when I ordered but just guessed Ecuador one darker and I was right. Too bad they ran out. Amorino chocolate is basically milk chocolate. I said ok to it cuz I wanted chocolate but deep down I was afraid it would be too sweet but turns out not at all, well balanced. 

Passionfruit 
Ah a refresher the bitter undertones. Do I wish it was brighter? Maybe. That will be a job for the citruses through. 

4.5* because I haven't found THE flavor or THE combination yet but I applaud the flavors and presentation and value"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2018-11-11,5.0,"After eating dinner I decided to walk around and see what was for dessert. I looked up ice cream and found Amorino. 

Upon walking in the first thing I noticed was it was very clean, a ton of gelato choice and pastries.
The choices are so numerous they all sounded great.

The great thing is you can order a 1/2 and 1/2 so you can have two flavors and have double the enjoyment.

I had a small scoop consisting of Coffee Gelato and Dark Chocolate Gelato. It was like having your dark chocolate cake and coffee all with each bite. 

The gelato is made with 100% all natural ingredients and they even have some sorbet choices.  I tasted about 4 gelatos and all were consistently smooth and creamy.

Staff were very friendly and pricing is reasonable. I found nothing to deduct from a 5 star experience here.

5 stars"
934,amorino-gelato-new-york-6,2019-06-21,4.0,"Small crowded but decent taste. They have a lot of flavours and they have a good presentation too
Price is reasonless enough . Quality is great.
Staff are so active and friendly ."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-12-10,5.0,"My expectations were low for this Grand Central coffee shop. However, I was blown away by one of the best coffees I've had in Manhattan thus far. I finished it so quick it didn't even make it back to my office. 

If your looking for a quality cup of coffee in Grand Central this is the best you'll fine there."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-10-25,4.0,I really liked this coffee located in the GC area. The service was fast and the coffee tasted fresh. The price was reasonable too. I didn't get anything else besides my coffee but this place was highly recommended to me.
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-07-06,4.0,Went to the Joes stand in Bryant Park and ordered a small black coffee. Super quick service with piping hot coffee. Pretty decent dark roast that doesn't need sugar to add flavor.
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-01-23,3.0,"This review is for the new location downstairs in the food court area. First, I would like to say that I am usually a big fan of Joe coffee and I've been to most of their locations in the city. I was eagerly awaiting for them to reopen in Grand Central. However the new location is not the best. It's by the tracks not too far from the bathroom and everything is completely open to the elements. I guess I could overlook that if the coffee was good but my latte didn't taste at all like the usual latte at Joe. Overall I was hugely disappointed and I am not planning to go back."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2018-03-16,5.0,"My number 1 coffee spot in GC area. Fast service. Excellent coffee, decent price. 

Love this spot!!!!"
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-04-28,4.0,"Sometimes I'm in the mood for a fresh Doughnut Plant doughnuts , and I'm not able to go down to say the 23rd Street store, So what I somethings do is go to Joe Coffee, inside Grand Central Terminal because they gets a fresh Doughnut Plant mix doughnuts delivery everyday.

This Joe Coffee is in the Gray Wing Hall. It's out side and parallel to the Grand Central Food Market near Lexington Ave. It you're not used to Grand Central then be warned that during rush hour the people stream in and out like mindless cattle so put down your phone and just walk around them.

Joe Coffee has a store where you can get lattes, ice coffees, Doughnut Plant doughnuts and other lite morning food items like croissants and it usually has a short line,  Then they all have a cart right outside were you pay and pour your own cup of coffee and also have the Doughnut Plant doughnuts too.

Joe coffees are descent Colombian medium blends but has no tables, stools, chairs or anything to lounge on so you need to take and go. Joe gets 4 stars from me all because of the doughnuts."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-02-01,3.0,"Latte and cappuccino are very flavorful and creamy. The strength of the caffeine at Joe's cafe will wake you up instantly. And staff is pretty friendly. 

The only thing I don't like about them is that there are no seats inside. None."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-25,5.0,"Delicious iced coffee, I didn't expect it to be this good. The price was reasonable too.  Didn't try any of the baked goods."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2015-05-29,4.0,"I love the Joe bar coffee shops. When I found out there was one on the way of my walk to work, I knew I had to find. It's hidden and Grand Central can definitely be overwhelming. 

This is the trick----you go uptown on Lexington---you pass the Grand Central Market -- enter the doors on the left---Joe will be on your left, both the cart and the shop. 

Joe got smart and set up a cart for those who know they want that drip and get to work. You walk up, order, get a punch on your card of course, serve yourself one of the two caffeinated types of coffee. I guess if you are a little nutty--there is decaf. Also there are some treats. I highly recommend the Pistachio Cardamom Bread. It has become a recent obsession of mine. That pistachio flavor is amazing. It always leaves a lovely little oil mark on the bag so it's most definitely a naughty treat but so worth the gym time. There are also croissants, cookies and Doughnut Plant doughnuts. One day I will grab a doughnut but I see that more in the fall. 

I waited in the coffee shop line this week. And I literally got one of my top five iced lattes of my life. It might have also been the fact that I didn't ask for non fat milk. There was the creaminess of the cold milk with the roasted, deep flavor of the espresso. Nothing could really beat grabbing the coffee and cutting through Grand Central on my way to work. I felt like I was truly in a NY movie! 

I will say there are no tables, stools, chairs or anything to lounge. This makes them lose the extra star. The location in the Village is still a favorite mine for lounging purposes and cuteness. But Grand Central is a great back drop and this morning there was even an impromptu jazz band playing right across the coffee shop."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2018-03-23,1.0,"I have really enjoyed their coffee. I come here every AM prior to boarding the train. Staff is always very friendly and helpful. Until this AM. And it will be my last time coming here to buy coffee. That's why I'm rating this a 1 Star.

I ordered a Cortado. Usually they fill it about half way in a small cup. I just asked the girl to tip it off a little higher with a little extra milk. The girl behind the counter (wearing a red shirt this AM) proceeds to charge me about .40 cents more telling me that's a small latte. It's not a small latte that's not what I asked for. She proceeds to try and talk to me like I'm some uneducated person and yelling st me. I asked you to fill a little more milk and you're going to charge me .40 more ...OK ....I'm just going to take my business elsewhere now that's all.

I didn't appreciate this employee's attitude this AM. While the coffee may be good, I'm not going to sit here and be overcharged, bait and switched, while I have to hear you talk down on me over a half inch more of coffee in my cup to prove a point.


There's plenty of places to choose from in Grand Central where I can receive better service. Cross off this and Zaros on your list. I won't be back here."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2017-02-21,5.0,"#Ikeepitreal... My colleague asked me to stop and pick her up a coffee, I wanted to try a new place. I came across Joe Coffee Shop and was like Ill try this place, it smells good! The smell of freshly ground coffee is amazing! There was no line, I ordered a capp and a almond milk latte. I loved how they had almond milk, you would think its commonplace for a coffee shop to have almond milk, but some dont which is sad. 

Both coffees came out looking really pretty! My colleague and I agreed the coffee was really really good! The staff was very nice. Im very happy to say there was nothing to complain about!

I would come here again in a heartbeat, im glad I stumbled upon this place!!  Thank you Joe!"
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2015-04-03,4.0,"A very impressive coffee spot inside of Grand Central Terminal. Their fresh brew coffee aroma is hard to resist. Needless to say, there is almost always a line here especially in the morning! There are no seatings and it is meant to be a grab and go spot.

When trying any new coffee spot, cappuccino is how they can make their first impression on me. I say so for sure, it's pretty good here. Well-balanced amount of milk and coffee. Not to mention, neat latte art puts a smile on my face. Get it!

Cold Brew is respectable. Excellent drip coffee here. Bold taste and refreshing. 

A huge selection variety of coffee beans from different parts of the world if you would like to bring some home as well. Overall, a solid coffee shop for the morning or for the afternoon."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-08-08,4.0,"Joe is now officially becoming my my third favorite coffee chains, ranked after Stumptown and caffe vita. It has a very clear taste and sipping their espresso is always like having a refreshment. 

This tiny little shop is secretly hidden inside GCT and I almost missed it - you would like to follow the track 11-17 route until you almost reach the lex exit. But one sec, don't rush into the shop yet, coz there is also a cute cart just steps away selling Joe's coffee as well. Grab a cup there!

This Joe is the only one opens up at 6:30am in the morning, might want to take advantage of it."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2017-01-11,4.0,"If you are in GCT and have the urge for coffee then definitely check these guys out. The only reason for four stars instead of five is due to its small size and long lines. However, if you enjoy great coffee it's worth the wait. The sweets are decent as well.
Tip: wait in the line on the right to order...then move over to the left line to wait for your coffee."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-07-03,4.0,"Great coffee priced at a very reasonable rate given the premium location! ($4 for small cold brew latte). 

The cold brew latte is bold but not overwhelming. A delicious drink to start a perfect day.

Would like to come back and try their expressos with latte art!"
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2017-04-30,5.0,"Great coffee at a very convenient location. Staff is friendly and efficient. On a Sunday morning, the line is not too long. Loved our cappuccino and mocha!"
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2013-11-23,5.0,"Came by the other day to get a small mocha for $4. This place is cash only.

Their small espresso beverages are merely 8 oz. Perfect in my book!

The espresso was smooth and the mocha wasn't too sweet, similar to Blue Bottle Coffee.

Convenient location inside Grand Central Station too!"
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2015-12-10,4.0,"My early morning fix in Grand Central Station! One of my fav coffee shops in the area, I usually go for a Moca which is absolutely delicious. Sometimes the temperature is a bit too cold for me but it is still so damn good :)

They also have a good variety of Doughnut Plant doughnuts and other pastries. 

There's almost always a line but it moves quickly. There's no seating which is ok most customers in Grand Central are on the go. 

I'm not an iced coffee kinda guy but my friend tells me the iced coffees are good as well.  

Oh yeah I love Starbucks and go there quite often mostly because they are every where in the city but, Starbucks has got nothing on Joe's!"
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2013-12-03,5.0,"I came here today after a fail trip to the Apple store. The people at this place are simply the friendliest people around. They helped pick up my less than ideal day. I got a warm apple cider which they say is a seasonal item. It was quite honestly delicious. 

The place itself is a bit difficult to find in the maze that is Grand Central. There aren't any seats either but it's perfect to get something on the go or to warm you up on your way out into the cold. 

I would definitely recommend this place to others and am coming back for sure."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2015-06-26,4.0,"There's nothing like a cup of Joe in the morning to wake you up before you head on over to work. 

I usually get a cold brew and the occasional donut. I prefer the coffee here compared to Starbucks and Gregory's, which are also located in Grand Central, but I like to switch it up from time to time so I rotate between the three. Joe's is my favorite at the moment, though.

The flavor is nice and round, none of that over acidic stuff that reminds me of burnt coffee beans that Starbucks serves. I also really like that they have simple syrup on the counter next to the milk because there's nothing worse than sugar granules that won't dissolve in an iced beverage.

It's not the kind of place you sit and lounge. It's strictly for people on the go, you go in, order and walk right back out. Perfect when you're on the run."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2017-03-20,4.0,"Tried Joe Coffee for the first time while on a trip to NYC. I've heard a lot about this place, and the comments have been nothing but good, so I decided to try this place out! The shop is located deep inside GCT. It took my a while to find it, since it's tucked so deep inside GCT. I almost missed it, but it's right near the Lexington exit. I bought a few different coffees to brew at home, and all were pretty good. In my opinion, it's definitely a step up from chains like Starbucks. They offer a LOT of different brews, so you won't be bored with them any time soon. If you are a coffee snob like me, then you'll appreciate Joe Coffee!"
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-03-17,5.0,"Such great coffee! I hadn't heard of this place but passed it and needed to try it. 

I had a large mocha- and it was amazing. The service was fast and friendly. I would definitely stop by here again."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-12-25,2.0,"I skimmed the other reviews and many of them have the keyword ""coffee snob"" - yes, those so-called coffee connoisseurs who simply want to sound edgy....

The coffee is not terrible, like Grumpy's but I'd grade it the second worst coffee in grand central. They don' take cards or apple pay - so you better be a cash carrying hipster wannabe attempting to assume the title of a ""coffee snob"" to add some spice to your boring high-rent city life."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-12-06,4.0,I've frequented various Joe locations over the years. The espresso drinks are good and they usually carry Doughnut Plant or Underwest Donuts which I love. I've gotten my morning latte at the Grand Central shop more often since I started committing via Metro North but when they do have really long lines I tend to go over to Grumpy instead.
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2015-06-03,5.0,"I'm in love!!! Simply hooked with the intoxicating aroma and taste of the most amazing espresso in New York hands down!! 

I have traveled throughout the city in search of the best coffee and finally found it!  Grand Central Joe's is the place to go when in dire need of a shot of espresso or a deliciously prepared cortado.  The staff is super friendly and just the best, they always greet you with a smile!  You will definitely love this place!"
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2013-10-03,5.0,"5 stars for the yummy latte!
We came here with friends who we're visiting from California while we were touring them around grand central station.
It's located on the main floor - NOT in the dining cafeteria below. 
It's a small shop - NO SITTING SPACE.  I wish they did cause it's nice to sit while enjoying my latte.  The staff is friendly and efficient as it seems that most people who came by were  dressed in suits and wanting to get the coffee and head straight for the office. 
Anyway... Try their raspberry doughnut from doughnut planet and remember ... It's CASH ONLY..."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2017-01-27,5.0,I cannot get enough of their cortado! My coworkers and I make any excuse to grab coffee during the day when meetings are tearing our eye balls out. A plus is that Joe's carry Donut Plant treats too!
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2015-03-07,3.0,"My wife and I wanted to try another new local spot in NY for coffee so we found Joes. Very small place, holds about 5-10 people max and there is no sitting area.

Cashier provided excellent service, very informative, and made sure to explain the sizes and how much coffee came in. 

Good coffee, strong and rich full."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2015-05-25,4.0,"Great coffee with a smile in the morning for the grumpy. I really don't like how it's cash only though, since then I have to deal with change.

I'd never regularly commuted by Joe until recently. The coffee cart concept is brilliant -- I've pretty much weaned off of Starbucks (for convenience purposes) and the awful coffee at the deli below my office. You pay and then it's somewhat self-serve. Two thumbs up for having almond milk. Sadly there aren't any healthy breakfast options but they have an impressive selection of Ovenly and Doughnut Plant goodies.

Areas for improvement: 
- Ipad payment or app payment.
- The lid, straw, milk, sugar area gets really dirty or bottlenecked. You could be waiting for a lid but someone's monopolizing the entire area. Make this area longer or larger slash more streamlined?"
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2014-10-22,5.0,"Another very efficient location. Even though there is a line out the door everyday, it goes by really quickly. If you're in a real hurry, they also have a kiosk outside for grab and go coffee.

The coffee here is strong and the portions are small ( this is a good thing for a coffee place).

But what I love most is that the people here genuinely seem like they like each other and their jobs. 

They only accept cash here. Next time you go, notice what happens when you forget to bring cash. 

That's pretty gravy, baby."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-07-19,3.0,Decent coffee spot inside of Grand Central Terminal. it's a little tucked away in the corner so it can be hard to find. Also they do not have anywhere to sit so you have to take your coffee to go
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2017-09-13,3.0,"A perfectly worthwhile midtown coffee experience. It's particularly useful as a neutral meeting site for, say, returning a book you have kept for far too long. The proximity to all major train lines makes for great ease of exit in even the most unideal exchanges."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-06-22,3.0,"I've been coming here for my morning coffee since 2011 and I still consider their coffee to be top notch. However, the recent staff changes has gotten me a little disappointed. What happened to the quirky yet friendly crew? The people that used to work there always had cheery smiles on their faces, which made my mornings a little brighter. The new staff now look like they haven't slept for days and they obviously hate their jobs. Hate to bring down their rating but this review is primarily for their staff changes."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-09-25,3.0,I am giving three stars because my last latte here was v good. Today it was bitter and mediocre. Took one bite of croissant and had to toss it! Dry and tasteless. Better at Northern Food Hall.
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2014-04-20,4.0,"Had a really good mocha coffee here.   Always a crazy long line in the mornings.
I was like a kid in a candy store when I shouted out - They have Ring Dings!  Look just like the old kind wrapped in the tin foil but they are much smaller.  Taste was pretty similar, not as good but not as artificial tasting either.  Problem was the price.  Crazy expensive.. I think $3.50 or maybe it was.  Too bad these are such a rip off, I won't be getting one again."
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-02-03,5.0,"If you want real coffee go here!!
This is not for your 2nd and 3rdcup! This is for your one and only!!!  You have been warned! The line us like a methadone clinic 
They need it!!  
Don't have more then 2 you will get lockjaw 
Enjoy! 
The coffee taste is strong not burnt very bitter but in a good way"
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2016-04-28,4.0,"They accept the Dollop App, code PXWRXP

I have a 2 hr commute to work, so I needed a quick wake up boost one morning. I asked the barista for a recommendation and she knew exactly what I needed. The coffee was so smooth that for the first time in my life, it didn't upset my stomach. And very flavorful! Now, I don't board the train in the morning without my Joe cup of coffee. And the staff is super friendly and efficient! Something hard to do at 6:30 am. I'm in and out of the shop in 3-5 mins. Great if you don't want to miss your train to upstate NY. :)"
935,joe-coffee-new-york-8,2013-11-07,3.0,Kind of tastes like Blue Bottle. Too watery and acidic for my taste.
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2020-04-05,5.0,I'm so happy this place is still open during this whole coronavirus shutdown. I need my macadamia latte before my shift at work !! I love that the place is right across my job. It's my picker upper in the morning. I love the macadamia latte with either caramel or vanilla. Genesis is a sweetheart. Please don't ever close down - i don't know what I would do without my coffee in the morning.
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2020-02-27,5.0,"The cutest coffee shop servicing quality coffee and delicious pastries. I've gone two days in row mainly because of the amazing lattes! The place plays really nice music but not too loud which is really nice, so lots of people are in there doing work and studying. I love the trendy, earthy, natural decor and the bear figures all over. 

The first time I went (yesterday lol) I had a slice of blueberry loaf cake with a vanilla latte. The cake was really good but the latte was glorious! Today, I had the almond croissant with a caramel latte. The almond croissant was flaky on the outside but soft and buttery on the inside with what seemed like hints of coconut flavoring which was rather delightful. My caramel latte though really good was not as amazing as the vanilla latte the day before. 

Both time the baristas were extremely friendly, so they get a A+ for customer service! Definitely a dope spot to enjoy a good hot or cold expresso beverage and chill."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2020-02-05,4.0,"I love cute coffee shops, and stumbled upon this one on a rainy day. It seems like the perfect place to get some work done or catch up with a friend. On that particular day, I was ravenous and I downed a warmed, flaky, buttery, almond croissant. Staff were very friendly and even alerted me to the discount for NYU employees and students. Be sure to ask if that applies to you :) 

I would definitely come back if I'm looking to kill some time in the area or in need of a caffeine fix."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-08-15,4.0,"Trendy coffee shop in near Bellevue. Offers a variety of coffee types, cold brew. 

Unique is the macadamia nut milk which is not as sweet as almond milk but has that subtle nutty flavor. 

The staff are very welcoming and helpful to suggestion. Love the decor of the shop, ample seating arrangements to get some work done, and they sell their own beans. 

The prices are standard city prices for boutique type coffee. That being said, the coffee is good, but not the best I've had. The cold brew was tasty and smooth, but again I've had better. 

I have and will continue to visit this place because it's unique to the area, offers macadamia nut milk which I enjoy, and priced accordingly. That being said, you can find better coffee so no need to travel out of your way."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-11-06,5.0,"So I did write a review back when this cafe opened up, but I felt like I should do a quick update now that I've been here so often!

Now that classes have started back up, I've found myself essentially caffeinating myself here in the mornings through the Ritual app, which I've had really good experiences with! My drinks are always made on time, and the staff are really nice. 

The friendly staff is probably the main reason why I come back aside from the convenience -everyone's actually genuinely interested in how your day is, and they remember faces easily. Genesis in particular, I feel, has always been so cheerful and accommodating! She essentially remembered my name and order after having met me a couple of times, and she makes a mean macchiato and hot chocolate.

I'm really glad that Proof opened here, and that they've been doing so well! Definitely come by if you're in the area!"
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-10-07,5.0,"You can find some high quality coffee here. The drip coffee was amazing! The only downside to this place was that the WIFI did not work for me, but the staff was really kind and gave me connection to their private WIFI - I really appreciated that. So, I'm still giving this place 5 stars because of the coffee and top-notch service. The menu seems to have some interesting options, so I'll have to come back soon!"
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-08-23,5.0,"Good coffee, better service. The cashier was so nice to my friend and me and we sat down for a while to chat after we ordered our coffees. I got a cold brew, and it was pretty strong. I can see the place getting crowded with college students in the fall, but over the summer there was good WiFi and ample study space."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-07-24,5.0,I absolutely loved the aesthetics of this coffee shop. It's located in a quieter part of the neighborhood and the shop itself isn't too bustling which allows for a nice study area or calm environment. I got the cold brew and was instantly blown away by the amazing quality of the coffee. With my first sip I could detect a slight chocolate-y taste and the smooth roast that was lower in acidity. One of the best cold brews I've had in town so far
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2020-03-30,5.0,By far favorite coffee in the neighborhood. Well worth the walk and extremely polite and friendly staff!
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-05-07,5.0,"Proof has some of the best coffee I've tried since coming to NYC two years ago. It is always aromatic, never overly bitter, and very smooth. My go to drink here is the oat milk latte and it has hasn't let me down yet. 

The service is also always friendly and welcoming. Today, Damian, or as he called himself, ""The Master"" of brewing, made my drink and again, it was top notch. I'll definitely be coming back and I encourage people to try this place as well; it's great!

Also, remember to get 10% off with your student ID or if you're a hospital employee!"
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-04-23,4.0,"I returned a couple of times since the owner commented on my first review below is my updated review:

The good:

-Hospital employee discount
-The staff is pretty nice and efficient and they play good music!
-The last few times I have gone there has been two staff which means wait time has been reduced
-Their matcha and chai lattes are good
- Cool decor
- Their quiches are yummy

The so-so:
Their actual coffee (I usually get lattes) is too strong and somewhat bitter.  Everyone has their preference on coffee but this is just not mine.

The bad: None

Final Verdict: Will continue to frequent this business when in the mood for match or chai."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2018-10-12,5.0,"So glad I found this place right near school! It's pretty tucked in this courtyard at 27th and 1st Ave, so it might be hard to find at first. Cafe itself is very cutely decorated with bear motifs here and there and a decent amount of tables for seating. I always see people there studying or chatting with friends. 

Their lattes and mochas are very delicious (rated in the highest tier of Manhattan coffee spots imo), especially their lattes with oat milk. My only complaint is that the prices for some of their drinks, especially the specialty ones, will run you at least $6. Service is friendly...there's a worker there who's almost always there each time and he is so endearingly grumpy. 

If you're associated with NYU, definitely show your ID to get 10% off!"
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-03-29,5.0,"Best coffee shop in the area!  A hot-spot for local med students and residents alike, PROOF is a coffee shop that uses their own beans to create sustainably-sourced and delicious cups of joe.  Not too busy depending on when you go, and there's a plethora of seating options depending on what you want: bar seating, large communal table, or small two-person table.  Often they're playing rumba music, which is a fun, upbeat chance of pace.  Decent prices and a variety of food options too if you're looking for breakfast, lunch, or a snack.  Will be back!"
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-09-09,4.0,Very cozy and quiet place. The staff is extremely welcoming and friendly. They take their time with each cup of coffee and you can taste the difference.
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-12-25,4.0,"While running  around the 20ish streets of Manhattan I stopped inside proof coffee roasters before making my way back to work and glad I did. This location is much bigger and eat in friendly compared to my main spot which is smaller then a broom closet . Hot and cold beverages , pastries including the donuts that are as heavy as major league baseballs , soups , salads , sandwiches , etc. I only do the morning visits and it's a Cappy and donut as always today and I found a table just for me . Friendly staff , good donut , good Cappy and my morning is off to a good start .The interior is set up nicely so you can enjoy your food and drink without feeling cramped and I like the comfy feeling of being able to take my sweet time before heading to work ."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-10-13,5.0,"I drink a lot of coffee and this coffee shop is tied for the best coffee place I've been to in NYC. The roasts are great, and cafe is well decorated, and they have a specialty macadamia nut latte that is absolutely delicious!

My roommate and I brew our own espresso as well and purchased some beans here, Damien (the baristo) was extremely helpful in picking out what blends we wanted and was a fun guy to talk to as well. 

I can't recommend this place enough!"
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2018-06-20,4.0,"Quite possibly the best espresso I've ever had. Super delicious and the staff here is exceptional. They take customer service to a whole new level and it's refreshing because you really don't see that everywhere. The cafe is right in the middle of a park area so you have to go out of your way to find it. Right near Bellevue Hospital and NYU it's definitely a spot frequented by employees at both institutions. It's pretty nice because you can sit on the benches right outside the cafe or inside. Seating is a bit limited in here, it's small. They have a few tables, some seating in the window, high top bar seating along the wall, facing the wall and a little couch/chair type thing. The place is decorated so nicely, it's really relaxing in there, lots of greenery and cool decor to look at. Kind of a bear mountain theme. 

Anyways, their coffee is great, they have specialty drinks that sound delicious like iced nutella drinks and other yummy things. They have some food, cafe type food, some KIND bars, etc. They have non-dairy creamers too. To be honest, the place is expensive. For example a large decaf americano is $4.20. Steep you know? Worth it because it's delicious, but steep. Last time I came in, one of the baristas came around with water glasses for everyone in the place as it was a really warm day outside. Like I said, exceptional service. NYU employees receive 10% off, which is a nice incentive. The atmosphere in here will keep me coming back. It's an ideal place to come on your lunch break to just relax and enjoy really tasty coffee. Outlets everywhere too!"
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-05-30,5.0,"I was with my hubby and I wanted to drink a great cup of coffee. So we decided to stop here & I am really glad we did! I asked Stephanie for a Capuccino, and I wanted it strong. I was pleasantly surprised! Lots of coffee shops make it more milky tasting. She was very pleasant to speak to and had a positive attitude! I let her know that I was pleased!  I spoke to the manager and let him know that she was a great employee! 

We will definitely return & recommend this place to anyone!"
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-06-19,5.0,Such an amazing little coffee shop with stellar baristas and service! The coffee is also excellent and they have a variety of pastry options as well. It is a nice space for meet ups or working- right next to NYU hospital/dental schools so plenty of people sitting and getting work done as well as a few coming in and out! (they have discounts for NYU students!) I will be frequenting this place and am excited to try everything off the menu
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-06-12,5.0,Nice new coffee shop. Tables were available during lunch time. Iced americano was good. Barista was very nice. We ordered using Ritual app. Order was ready in 2 min and pick up was easy.
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-09-29,5.0,"Just moved to the area and stopped by to check out the coffee shop. It is very adorable, smaller but has everything you need for a quick bite. The girl behind the counter was very kind and made the best macadamia nut latte. They also has vegan muffins, along with other assortments of pastries, essentia waters and Spindrift."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-10-04,4.0,"Solid coffeeshop near Bellevue Hospital. Spacious, bright and clean. Friendly service. Overpriced but decent coffee. Good environment to do laptop work or read."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-02-16,5.0,"Hands down the best best coffee in New York. And I am serious about my coffee! The pour overs are the smoothest most delish. My husband and I jump out of bed on the weekend to get coffee :) also, try the macadamia nut milk - holy moly.

The vibe has a lot of doctors and med students since near the hospital so you can also meet really nice smart people.

Damian always makes our coffee special and knows our order. A true pleasure and you can taste his passion for the coffee."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-03-13,5.0,Nice and cozy cafe to study if youre a student at nyu. We all know it can get so crowded at the building so this is a nice quiet place to sit down and study away. Coffee beans are great and the pastries are delicious. New go to study spot!
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-09-01,5.0,Phenomenal coffee and super friendly women who clearly has the customer in mind. She made our coffee experience really special. Will be back! Looks like a great study spot with natural light too.
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-11-14,5.0,Friendly staff! the coffe and Apple chicken brie sandwich was amazing. Perfect study spot
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-02-18,5.0,"As an RN I know coffee and this place has fantastic coffee. Hands down the best coffee within a 10 minute walk of Bellevue. Highly suggest walking down the random side street to check it out, and also it's an excellent place to study. Two lattes up for proof!"
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-01-05,4.0,"Proof makes their own coffee and sells it in premade packs. I've had an double espresso, americano and flat white on various occasions which were solid in flavor and quantity. It is on the more bitter, smoky side but not burnt like Starbucks. They also have some breakfast and lunch items available - oatmeal, sandwiches, pastries, etc - and an oven for warming or roasting. 

Its located between 27 and 26 streets (2nd & 1st Avenues) inside a residential complex and across the street from a park. Theres lots of seating options including a bench with coffee bag pillows. It's never super busy either and they do have wi-fi for those who want to monopolize their study/work time over coffee. Nearby hospital row on 1st & 2nd Avenues so you'll see people coming in their scrubs. 

Overall it's a nice coffee shop nestled in a quiet area with not a lot of tourists and reasonable prices. Customer service is superb and they are always welcoming with positive vibes."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-11-08,5.0,Cozy coffee shop slightly hidden in middle of park. Muffins and coffee were great. Cashier was charming. Great spot near NYU hospital if you want somewhere mellow to recharge. +they have good wifi and a couple outlets for chargers.
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-03-06,5.0,"This is what people have in mind when they say they want to open up a coffee shop one day.  Baristas are great and it's never crowded in here, but also not so empty it makes you nervous they're about to close lol"
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-09-25,5.0,"WOW! the baristas at PROOF are coffee angels here on earth. i literally never write reviews, rarely write positive ones, but the service here deserves all the recognition it can get. PROOF was an amazing way to start my morning, plus they heat up the almond croissants."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2018-05-05,5.0,"I am always happy to hear about new coffee shops in my neighborhood, therefore decided to check out Proof on a Friday morning. After a breezy and leisurely stroll through  the small park by NYU, I walked into a cute and bright coffee shop. The decor is minimalistic and modern, consisting mostly of light neutrals and wooden accents. The vibe is inviting indeed. 

I ordered a cold brew and waffle to go with it. As many on here have mentioned, the cold brew was super smooth and easy to drink - it would be especially good on a hot day! The barista also toasted the waffle for several minutes before serving it, which really enhanced the flavor and texture. 

I appreciate the abundance of natural sunlight and can see it being a great place to chill out or study/write. I will definitely be coming back to try some of their other drinks and snacks."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-08-19,5.0,I love this little gem.  I discovered iced coffee with macadamia milk mixed with a little whole milk. Delicious.  Everyone who works there is super friendly.
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-10-13,5.0,"The coffee here is exceptional! I had the macadamia latte which had a pleasant flavor and was very smooth. 

I also had a great conversation with the barista, Damien about espresso and the different flavor profiles of the roasts they carry."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-09-30,5.0,"Delicious coffee and friendly service. Just keep in mind it is a very small seating area in an office building rather than a coffee shop to sit in. Still, they make the little seating area nice."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-10-16,5.0,"Great coffee, warm staff, decent seating for individual work/study.  Easily the best coffee shop in the surrounding 4-5 block area."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-06-20,5.0,Service here was amazing and quick.  Brandon made me a fantastic iced mocha. It was not too sweet and the shop carries Oat Milk.  I would strongly recommend coming here if you also want a nice place to have some good drinks and WiFi to get some work or studying done.
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-08-10,5.0,"A perfect coffee shop! I love that there's finally a place in my neighborhood to sit and do work. The cold brew is fantastic, and there is always plenty of room (and power outlets & wifi) to get work done. The staff is friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this place (and the sweet bread)."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2018-05-31,4.0,"I got a matcha latte here, and it was pretty good. I came on a rainy Thursday afternoon to get some schoolwork done, and this place had to perfect vibe for that. It was really cozy and the decor was really minimal/industrial-chic (which I'm really into). 

The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is that they don't have a public restroom, which is pretty out of the norm for a coffee shop. I ended up having to leave and rush to a friend's place to pee."
936,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york-5,2019-06-24,5.0,"Amazing coffee / study / meetup spot to post up at. Great coffee with good variety of drinks. Recommend the Iced Nutella Latte if you're feeling a dessert drink that'll wake you up. Prime location right across Bellevue Hospital. Extremely friendly service, special shout out to Brandon for being one of the friendliest, attentive, cool baristas I've ever met. I come here multiple times a week and usually stay for hours because of how nice the space is and people are. Also, the music is LIT!"
937,ground-central-new-york,2020-03-31,5.0,"This might be my new favorite coffee shop/ work cafe. Love Love Loved my experience here. Great music, Good coffee, Amazing pastries, Spacious and the Staff, friendly! The internet was a bit shaky at first, but that was soon troubleshooted. The music did get too loud at times, but that was ok. (The staff listens to the request of their costumers and does the best they can to accommodate them). 

If Ground Central was not far from where I live, I would probably be here daily. (Note: the lunch hour rush is crazy!)"
937,ground-central-new-york,2020-03-28,4.0,"Cool trendy coffee shop on the East side.  They have high tops in front and more lounge style chairs in the back. It is kind of tight in here with low ceilings.  The area in the back is really tight and feels like my Mom's living room when all my cousins are over. They do have Good wifi and service if you want to get work done.  I would definitely come back. They also have small pastries including cannelle's which are always a unique treat to see.  I will be sure to try these next time I am in. 

Although it gets busy you can be in and out pretty quick here.  The coffees come out fast and the service is on point. They have a small bathroom in the back too if you need it. I do like the place and recommend it if you need a coffee and to get some work done."
937,ground-central-new-york,2020-03-23,2.0,"A while back, I came here to have a nice coffee while reading. I thought the environment would be good for that since there is a room in the back with cozy seating, relaxing lighting, and shelves full of books. However, one of the employees was sooo loud the entire time and had absolutely no filter, which seems more appropriate for a casual bar setting, not a coffee shop. No matter where I sat in the coffee shop, I could hear everything she said, including all of her personal business. Just don't come here and expect to be able to focus easily on anything. Also, they told me all the food on the menu, except the food on display, was sold out.. On a positive note, the drink I ordered was delicious!"
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-10-01,5.0,"This coffee bar is a hidden gem in the city of New York. I enjoyed it when the baristas take the time to make a design with the foam. Is it necessary no but it's a touch that adds value and care to each cup and starts my morning off right. 

I normally order a hazelnut latte and it's delicious. When I first walk in the bar has a weird smell but then it's gone. In the back is a nice seating area."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-09-10,5.0,"Wow. This is a hidden gem. Swung by Ground Central while wandering through Midtown -- in desperate search of a coffee -- and quickly fell in love.

I went with the Nutella Brioche and Cold Brew, then popped a squat in the back library area for some studying. The ambience is perfect for getting serious work done without disturbances. Strongly suggest students and professionals checking this spot out.

937,ground-central-new-york,2019-08-06,5.0,"Super polite, they were getting ready to close when I walked in but treated me like the first customer of the day. Made me welcome and were extremely eager to make my coffee. Either they are paid really well and are happy to work here or they are just excellent employees. Maybe both, who knows! They were even having some funny banter but incorporated me into the conversation as opposed to continuing in a manner that would have made a customer feel like we're interrupting them. 

I wasnt 100 sure what I wanted. I just needed caffeine, he read my face well and made some suggestions and made me a perfect caramel macchiato with a double shot. I have a sweet tooth. Sue me. 

They have a great little seating area in the back that screams coffee shop lounge. I loved it. 

I'll definitely be making this a common stop on my way to smoke a cigar nearby."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-11-28,5.0,We came here following the Macy's day parade and were pleasantly surprised by the amazing ambience. There was a cool lounge area in the back with lots of seating options and a great book selection.  We ordered mint tea and Malbec...both were very good. Customer service here was phenomenal as well! I highly recommend just coming here to relax and chill
937,ground-central-new-york,2020-03-13,2.0,"Rude staff, cute place. Went in with a friend for tea. Loved the lemon ginger tea. Sat in the back where they have comfortable couches. They would have gotten 2 more stars if it wasn't for the rude girl who took our order and was even more rude when she came to tell us they're closing and we needed to leave."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-08-30,4.0,"Spent several mornings here as I occasionally need to get some computer work done. Arrived around 8:00 am.
Observations:
- Music is really loud and depending on the station, the music can really obnoxious and distracting.
- Coffee...really good.
- They say you get free WIFI, but could NEVER establish connection to it.  So I end up connecting to the ""Link NYC-Free Wifi"" which works really well!!
- Dimmly lit to keep a ""cool vibe"", I guess.  Not preferred for me.  
- My order is taken and made promptly.  I guess it has to do with the time I get here.

Ground Central is not my preferred spot to do computer work.  But, for a quick meet-up with friends, its a thumbs up!  
But, I still think the music is just turned up wayyyy too loud.

Price point:  $4.25 + tax (4.63) for a small latte.  Pastries range from $3 - 6."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-03-11,5.0,"Ground Central is a small cafe in the busy streets of NY, but is truly a delightful find. The coffee was tasteful with its authenticity bursting through every sip. 
The front portion of the cafe is busy with people conversing, but the portion towards the back is secluded, giving it the perfect study vibe- especially if you're into the quiet dim lit study atmosphere. 
The coffee prices are reasonable, with exquisite flavors such as Banana syrup to add to your coffees. They also have a wide variety of hot and iced drinks, which I truly appreciated. 
Whether you want to grab a quick coffee, pop in to catch up with a friend, or even to spend a few studious hours, this is the place for you!"
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-09-28,5.0,"Visiting from out of town, looking for a quick coffee around the corner... found it! Ordered a a cappuccino for stay and it was made properly and with care! I sneaked in the back room which has a quiet nook filled with books. Relaxed and enjoyed my coffee in a cool spot. The baristas are quick and have a cool edgy vibe to them, love it. Definitely worth the time! Wish they took Apple Pay though!"
937,ground-central-new-york,2020-01-03,5.0,Very excellent little coffee joint. Superb flat white. Excellent croissants. Ridiculous chocolate chip cookie. Very cool space. Good customer service. Nice little shop near the UN.
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-09-13,5.0,Just finished a 7am visit for my usual double espresso. Love the vibe here. Place has a unique vibe as it doubles as a bar. Why the 5 stars? The service was that good. I came in with my infant and kid and they treated them extra special. I really appreciated going above the usual.
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-06-22,4.0,"This is probably one of my favorite coffee shops in the city. Despite being in the center of manhattan, the feel of the interior gives off a secluded ambiance that allows you to be in your own world. The service is quite fast and you never have to wait for a long time to get your coffee like at Starbucks. 

As for the taste of the coffee, the house blend has a coarse taste that would positively surprise anyone from coffee connoisseurs to the average Joe. 

Also, if you are a reader, at the end of the hallway of the coffee shop, you'll find an area where you have several couches and books. So that's unique too!"
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-08-23,4.0,"I love exploring new coffee shops and came upon this place while walking home from my internship one day! I told myself I'd come back and do so on a weekend with my book :) it's a little dark in there but they have a cute spot in the back with some book shelves and it's a nice spot to do some work or read - and of course, have some coffee :)"
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-08-07,3.0,"Returned here at a different time in hopes of grabbing a couch seat and doing some audio editing before heading to an appointment. 12:30- 2:30pm on a Wednesday turned out to be the wrong time to do this. Place was loud, rowdy and packed with suits. No seating available in back. Plus the cashier this time seemed a bit pushy, rushing me to place my order as soon as I walked in the door. Here, you have to be on your toes, know exactly what you want and not keep people waiting.  

Reasons why I still gave three stars: 

The staff was more playful and engaging this time so I'll give them that. And they made me laugh. 

Points for a fabulous oat milk iced latte!"
937,ground-central-new-york,2018-11-14,5.0,"As my last review for Ground Central was over 4 years ago, and I'm still a regular at this local coffee powerhouse, it was time for an update. 

When I first ""discovered"" this cozy, loungy coffeeshop in the heart of Midtown East, little did I know I'd be working around the corner a few years later.  Today, it's my regular go-to and I'm there almost daily.  

You may have noticed above that I called Ground Central a ""coffee powerhouse.""  That's because they *know* the midtown workday grind and they get you thru the line fast.  Quick service with a smile in the morning or afternoon, or even on the weekends, the staff and coffee there never disappoints.  Serving La Colombe beans for the coffee drinks, Jacques Torres chocolate for mochas, DOUGH for doughnuts and Jacques Torres chocolate chip cookies baked on premises, not to mention other pastries and sandwiches, there really is something for everyone. (Yes, they have Oat Milk, too!) 

Although the front of the shop can feel a bit rushed and loud at times, step into the back area for a quieter, more relaxed nook with plenty of seats."
937,ground-central-new-york,2020-01-05,5.0,"I travel the country as an airline crew member and I am always checking out local coffee joints. Ground Central is by far the top of the list! (Nation wide!) The music, the atmosphere, the library lounge in the back, not to mention awesome drinks and service by Siam (hope I spelled that right) all differentiates this place from the ho-hum average independent cafe. Don't take my word for it though. Wanna know if I'm right? Only one way to find out!"

Good music 
Good internet / free
Great coffee 

Definitely recommend for a good working session jn an ideal coffee shop setting."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-04-10,4.0,"Really cool, hip, coffee shop. NOT a great place for a work meeting though.

I chose to meet someone here for a work meeting, as many yelpers have noted the many seats that are available in this coffee shop. I arrived to my meeting 30 minutes early, which was a great idea, as it was very crowded in there at 4:30 pm. I was able to grab a small two top table on the right side of the coffee shop. For my order, I went with an almond milk latte which was very good and frothy. My guest went with a regular latte and she really enjoyed it. I really love the decor in here and enjoyed the music. However, the music isn't great if you're trying to have a conversation with someone who is soft spoken and it's for work purposes. Maybe it depends on your job, but that was my experience. Overall, I personally loved this place and would visit again for personal reasons, but I probably wouldn't come again for another work meeting."
937,ground-central-new-york,2020-01-29,5.0,"A gem in the otherwise crowded coffee scene. The baristas and the owners  are incredibly kind, cool, and welcoming. I literally went here one time six months ago and fell in love right away. One of the best coffee shops I've been too, and the beans they selll are phenomenal as well!"
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-05-30,4.0,"Cute cafe with lots of seating compared to other coffee shops in the area. There is WiFi but this place is not the best working environment since they play music so loudly. Fun environment to catch up with friends though.

Oat milk latte 5/5 
I didn't see oat milk on the menu but they do have it for an extra 75 cents. Unsure why they charge 25 cents more for oat milk versus other milk substitutes (soy, almond, coconut) but the latte was delicious! Super creamy and I would come back just to order this again.

Almond croissant 3/5 
It was okay. The croissant was not the flakiest and it barely had any almonds on it. Would not recommend ordering."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-12-20,1.0,Fabulous Place! Don't ask for the crossiant to be toasted or Johnny will throw it at you!
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-07-27,1.0,"Wanna twiddle your thumbs and wait forever while the baristas make you feel like a moron? You've found your soulmate in New York coffee shops. Been here dozens of times because it's close to where I work but always regret it. Coffee isn't special. Baristas ALWAYS are confused and disorganized. 

But yo, if you consider yourself helplessly confused and have have hours of dispensable time on your hands, go for it. But in New York, people tend to have somewhere to be with a time crunch."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-09-21,4.0,A great cup and a nice respite from midtown. My go to spot in the area when you want more than coffee as sustenance with a good way to kill some time. It's pretty loud so maybe don't have your 10:10 here.
937,ground-central-new-york,2020-01-24,2.0,"Hilariously bad customer service. After attempting to double charge me on purpose (covering up register with hand to try to make it so I didn't catch the $14 coffee charge), the barista refused to heat up my egg sandwich. When I told him I wouldn't get it any longer, he said ""fine, but it'll be 10 minutes""....ended up being one of the driest sandwiches I've ever had. While it's a cool vibe and has decent coffee, definitely don't go expecting to be treated like a human"
937,ground-central-new-york,2018-05-01,5.0,"This is my favorite midtown cafe. There is a workspace in the front of the shop with occasional cute guys (that don't talk to you but hey eye candy) and a cozy space in back to enjoy your coffee offerings. The cold brew is less acidic than say the big green chains coffee and it's a smooth drink. They also have chocolate offerings.

I came here for a special Gilmore girls event a few
years ago not for the first time and enjoyed pretending ground central was Luke's.

So far I haven't had a bad cup of coffee here. Let me know when you do. But I doubt it."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-08-07,5.0,"Very cool spot! Great music, good drinks, and fun staff. I really like the layout, dark, long and very art deco area in the back for hanging out. My youngest daughter really liked the Matcha Green Tea there and she tried different locations throughout N.Y. She had to have Central Ground. Met up with my cousin there and really enjoyed the place. Looks great joint for locals and tourist. If you are in the area check them out."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-10-29,5.0,Their oat milk chai latte us off the charts delicious. I also recommend their croissants...be sure to request that they warm it up. The atmosphere here is fun and trendy....haven't found anything to equal it in Manhattan
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-11-17,3.0,"Great cappuccino, friendly staff, and respectful people. It's very cool and comfortable, but it's SO DARK. This place made me too sleepy to actually focus on my work. If they added more light in here this would easily be my go-to place."
937,ground-central-new-york,2018-11-23,4.0,"Good place for coffee, pretty chill environment. In ordered cappuccino. I love the smooth cream on the top and the fresh  coffee in the bottom."
937,ground-central-new-york,2020-01-03,2.0,"I was really disappointed by my experience here, especially after reading so many great reviews. I needed a quite place to work in midtown, and the moment I walked in I questioned if this was the right spot for me. The music was SO loud for 2:00 in the afternoon in a cafe in Midtown East, and it was electronic music. Didn't fit the space. The staff were so indifferent, and they spent 90% of my time at the counter complaining about their manager, and how its illegal to not pay staff during a voluntary meeting? I stayed because I'd ordered a coffee, but deeply regretted it. Listening to the staff yell at each other full volume across the cafe as if they were in their apartment?  I will not be back."
937,ground-central-new-york,2018-09-06,4.0,"I'm a local place kind of guy. When I travel, I prefer to avoid chains. Usually happy when I do. This is certainly no exception. 

Ground Central. Great name to go with quality coffee and really good space. Got some work done too. Work & tourism kind of go hand in hand for me. 

All I had was a simple black coffee. It was flavorful without going over the top. Definitely had the NYC vibe. Give it a try."
937,ground-central-new-york,2018-09-11,4.0,"There are so many coffee shops in the city and we happened to come across this little shop. Super cute set-up! Traditional cramped entrance with little room to sit but if you walk all the way to the back, it opens ip to this library like area. Very cozy but was very packed so we opted to get our coffee and chai tea and head out. We got a chocolate chip cookie which was really big and super moist."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-05-26,5.0,This place was conveniently around the corner from our hotel and the easy access was amazing. The sandwiches are really good and the coffee is amazing. The cappuccino was perfect they even had iced chocolate for my sister who is not a coffee fan. Both times I visited they were playing oldschool jams and it was awesome  Definitely make it in if you're on that side of the city!
937,ground-central-new-york,2017-10-18,3.0,"Good spot to work out of.. they have some comfy seating in the back (though not many outlets) and a communal table up front. They also have free WiFi and I was impressed with how clean and odor free the bathroom was despite all the people in an out (you'll need a password for the door)

I only wish they had better food choices ... pastries didn't look appealing and I didn't want a salad or sandwich. 

I also found the couches in the back to be quite smelly (and many of the seating was worn). They really ought to take a febreeze to them daily because people's body odors have been embedded in the fabric."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-11-16,5.0,"Really nice coffee, especially cappuccino !!! Also I like reading area decorated with books ! So classy! Also that's not far from my place , so now I am a regular customer !"
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-12-18,5.0,Great coffee !!!!! Amazing music and vibe ! Super friendly baristas making the drinks ! I live coming here !
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-05-05,5.0,"Stopped in on a rainy day for a coffee and a snack. I got a cappuccino and a spinach, feta, and tomato turnover. Both were good, the turnover would've been better warm but no complaints. It's a cute little place, make sure to use your nose to lead you to the door. Great playlist!!! There's a small cozy area all the way in the back, WiFi, tables and a window bar. The baristas were both super friendly. 10/10 recommend."
937,ground-central-new-york,2019-01-16,1.0,"I wasn't a fan of this place. I was looking for a coffee shop where I could go do my work on my laptop. While the coffee was okay - nothing mind blowing but not bad either - it was extremely dark and the music was blasting so loud I was uncomfortable. I would even have hated the music if I wasn't trying to concentrate. I won't come back to study, or have coffee- I'll just go to Starbucks next time if I'm in the area."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2020-04-18,5.0,"OMG! the beat bakery in NYC
 The black n whites are so fresh. That's a big deal for this Jewish woman!
I love the green olive breadsticks and their sticky bun. I could seriously have one of every baked item in this place! It's small and you might just walk by it on 8th Avenue (btwn 46/47) but if you see it..
go in and treat yourself! There is seating in the back too"
938,amys-bread-new-york,2020-02-22,4.0,"Fantastic and unique baked goods such as their bread twists with savory and sweet flavors such as olive and chocolate chip. They also have delicious layer cakes they serve whole or by the slice. The hot beverage options and cozy seating area in the back make it a nice place to sit for a while if you are lucky enough to find an opening. IMHO this place has lost a star for me over the years because of the sometimes brusque service that makes it seem as though the staff is annoyed by their customers. Overall though, a neighborhood gem and I hope it stays around.

A word of warning that some of their other locations do not at all live up to this original (see my review of Brooklyn Heights location)"
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-09-02,4.0,"I wandered Amylessly around Manhattan until I found Amy's Bread, and I have to say, it was pretty good.

Cute little bread shop in the Midtown area and extremely popular. I came here on a very rainy day and got a couple of pastries that the woman here recommended that I try. To be honest, I wasn't blown away and I think the reviews might be overblowing the quality and deliciousnessand uniqueness a little bit, but in Manhattan there's a lot of bad overpriced stuff, and this is certainly the ""real deal"" and better than most bakeries, and more innovative too.

Also, the service was nicem even if prices were a little higher than they should be (even by NYC standards), the treats weren't bad at all."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-07-08,3.0,"I had a major Brownie craving and researching NYC's best offerings, Amy's Bread popped up several times as one of the city's best.

Deviating from the traditional square shape, Amy's version is round and resembled a large Reese's Peanut Butter cup, complete with a pleated outer edge.

It had the required slightly crisp outer layer and also nestled inside was the expected slightly chewy moist texture.

My gripe was I felt the chocolate flavor needed to be intensified. Amy'
s Brownie had a very light milk chocolate flavor, and personally, I prefer a darker and deeper chocolate flavor.


A solid Brownie but one of the best in NYC...........that I find doubtful."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-08-31,5.0,"I wanted to make a sandwich, and bf suggested we get fresh bread from Amy's bread. We got the ciabatta roll and holy crap. It's. So. Good. It has a perfect crunchy exterior and super soft/pillowy center. 

Also, I was tempted by their baked sweets. Got their sticky buns (a must) and carrot cake. Which to my surprise, I really enjoyed because their frosting wasn't too sweet. 

It's definitely more crowded on the weekends so I'd suggest taking your heavenly bag of carbs back home."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-12-06,5.0,"I think I'm addicted to everything I've tried here. 
Berry scones. Tangy, rosemary, and olive sourdoughs. Carrot cake. Everything tastes so fresh and it's actually a great place to sit and read or do some work in the back. Next door you'll also find some great bagel sandwiches during breakfast hours (they run out on the weekend around 1pm usually)."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-09-25,4.0,"The products here are excellent! Service is lacking a bit. I've never had anything from here I didn't love from the breakfast sandwiches to the cakes to the croissants to the cupcakes to the coffee. I'm a big fan. I would love to see an improvement in the service because in the morning, they move so slow and never have enough people working, and on top of that, they are usually a bit rude. It's sort of off putting but maybe it's worth It for how good it is. ‍ you decide! The chocolate croissants are delicious!"
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-02-10,4.0,"So left with the decision of the major Starbucks brand or the local Amy's Bread cafe, I obviously went with the smaller option which turned out to be the better choice in the end. 

Thankfully Amy's Bread was not too far of a jaunt from my hotel, so it mad it an even easier choice when looking for my morning caffeine fix. The shop itself is pretty small, but surprisingly not too filled during peak coffee hours due to many grabbing to go's. Amy's Bread as the title suggests offers a fair share of bread, both sweet and savory at a reasonable price point. I grabbed a plain croissant, and while I am not croissant connoisseur, I felt like it was on point in terms of quality and taste and price! The coffee was not too bad as well and according to the super friendly staff, it is a local blend. 

I can see why there is such a cult following as Amy's Bread really delivers to those watching time go by enjoying breakfast and the others who are on the go and need a great option to do so with."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-09-20,4.0,"I went by this several times before deciding to get in line one morning.

Lines move fast as long as you know what you keen on. It's not easy to browse the wide selection during peak hours so check out their website to speed up your decision making before you get in.

Small seating area with counters that you can stand at if you so choose.

The bagels and sticky bun was good.

Next door is The Pantry that touts artisanal products and coffee. Not sure if they allow seating when you buy from the main shop."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-08-17,3.0,"We went on a Friday evening, it was pretty empty. We ordered some lattes and cakes to stay. We said we wanted the order to the stay but yet the barista asked if we wanted the drinks in a paper cup or mug. Why would you give the lattes in a paper cup if the mugs are for the to stay option?? I thought that was really weird. The attitude of the cashiers were lackluster, they seemed annoyed. The cheesecake was ok, it was on the hardier side. Nothing special about the bakery."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-01-29,4.0,"There are not many good reasons to eat in Hell's Kitchen. Fortunately, Amy's Bread is one of them. They make seriously high quality baked goods and bread. 

The sticky bun is top notch, although I will admit it wasn't as outstanding as people make it out to be. I was pleasantly surprised by their cake doughnuts which are delicious (pumpkin pecan and triple chocolate). The almond brioche toast is was ok. It's basically soft toast with some marzipan flavor. I will be back for more baked goods like the croissant twists.

Also, the staff is great. Near Thanksgiving I was given an entire bag of fresh bread loaves for no reason. I was speechless."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-09-06,5.0,"There are a lot of delicious things at Amy's Bread, but their Black & White Cake is what I keep coming back for. Hands down the best cake in NYC! My only complaint is I wish there was more seating as it gets crowded occasionally."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-11-05,3.0,"Amy's stale pastries. They need a fridge or something because for the price this is a bit of an insult. Coffee was good, hense the 3 stars.
I'm sure the bread is great. I guess I'll check it out later."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-09-10,4.0,"I come here often, i love the pastries. However a certain barista/counter person is very rude all the time. Always feels like he's annoyed and last night just drops what i ordered on that brown paperbag, not doing it gently or in a respectful manner. Didn't want to say anything as i don't want to make things awkward everytime i go there, But the lady behind me said something to the counter person about her colleague being rude and said he's scary. I overheard the conversation as i was fixing my bag and i just agreed that yes he's rude. The lady(counterperson) who's always nice, called the guy to probably calm down.

Anyways, the Coconut Dream bar is a must try!
I also love the double chocolate brownie"
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-04-28,5.0,This place was smaller than I thought it was. There were some tables in the back of the store. There is no restroom though. The sticky bun was really good. Black and white cookie was also really good. I also loved the almond brioche toast. Cardamom bread was a special item the day I went. And it was just ok.
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-10-15,5.0,"Amazing cakes, cookies, cupcakes and more. Yes, they have bread but they also have things that are made with bread: muffins, rolls, focaccia, etc. The place is small but the amount of sweet and savory goodies that they pack in there make it really tough to choose. I tried the pumpkin doughnut which was truly perfect in every way."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-02-26,4.0,"Bakery with lots to love. 
They make a delicious sticky bun.
The curried cauliflower and sweet potato salad with cannellini beans made for a quick, light and healthy lunch."
938,amys-bread-new-york,2020-01-13,1.0,I don't understand why the people behind the counter have to be so damn rude. 5 stars for the carrot cake and 1 for the attitude. Love your baked goods but don't love all your employees.
938,amys-bread-new-york,2020-04-26,5.0,Normally only get bread here for special occasions and ended up stopping by for something sweet during this corona nightmare.  Had a blueberry muffin and a cookie and they were delicious!
938,amys-bread-new-york,2019-10-10,5.0,"Whenever I need a birthday cake, I come here. So far I've tried the carrot cake and velvet cake; absolutely delicious. Its probably the best of each cake I've ever had. They are so rich and tasty. It's the perfect level of sweet. A lot of cakes that I have had lately were overly sweet, these have been perfect. 

I haven't tried anything else here, but if it's anything like the cakes it must be delicious."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2019-05-13,5.0,"Ground Central is located further away from my office, but I decided to take a morning stroll since reviews of this coffee shop are generally positive. 

Upon arrival, the coffee shop is very cozy with friendly staff members and  a fridge on the side with parfaits and bottled drinks. I ordered a flat white with the ham & cheese croissant.

I got my flat white almost instantly. It was sleek and velvety in texture. The creaminess does not overpower the double shot espresso, so I'm still able to taste the coffee. Croissant took a while to heat up, but it was quite delicious. The pastry is toasted and flaky, while the cheese is melted onto the ham. It was a great savory breakfast and kept me full all morning.

Overall, I liked Ground Central and will definitely be back when I'm in NY."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2019-08-21,4.0,"When I got here it was next to empty and quiet- I don't know how that happened, but I was grateful. I got a mocha, nabbed a bench, and enjoyed the peace. The ambience is awesome, and I love that the seating looks like the inside of a train terminal. I'm kicking myself for not picking up a bag of their coffee- definitely will next time. The mocha was not overly sweet so it actually tasted like chocolate and coffee, not like syrup, which I really appreciate.

Yes, it's small, no there aren't a lot of seating options, but I love that it is a small oasis where you can nab a good local roast only a few minutes walk from GCT."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-07-31,5.0,"This is the cutest coffee place in midtown! 

I came by this spot twice now and love it. The first time I had the chai with almond milk, which was delicious. Today I had the Nutella brioche and it was amazing too! It's a really small place with tiny tables but is super cute and cozy! I'll definitely be back."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2019-10-20,5.0,Great service and love the cozy atmosphere m. Ordered my drink ahead of time on the app. Staff was very nice and informative. They also have a reward system. Many vegan options. Highly recommend!
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2019-05-05,5.0,Coffee here is amazing. Its always freshly brewed and full of flavor. I love their cold brews. They even sell bags of coffee to take home and brew on your own.
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2019-08-22,2.0,"The coffee is good - I will give it that. The customer service has always been a toss up for me and today, was the final straw. I went in to order an iced macchiato and for some reason, the bartender and cashier (both men) felt the need to explain to me what a macchiato was and then told me I was getting a latte. As an avid coffee drinker and as a woman, this was so insulting. The gentlemen who was making the drinks is usually curt and not friendly - but today, he was just an a*s. I wonder how many other women he feels the need to explain their coffee orders to."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-12-14,4.0,"This coffee shop is cool and all but it's small, real small. The seats along the wall don't offer much room in terms of personal space. The tables are right next to each other so I was pretty much touching hips with the girl sitting at the table next to me and the seating is bench seating so if you don't mind cozying up next to a stranger while sipping your brew, this is your spot. The coffee was good, not the best cup I've had in the city but good. I liked their decor, books on the shelves that I'm assuming you could just pick up and read if you wanted to, not sure but that's my assumption. They had some food in their cooler and some healthy drinks, I just stuck to coffee. It's not cheap, $3.50 or so for a medium. The thing that irks me about this shop and many many other coffee shops is that there is no bathroom in here. That's an issue for me. If I'm posted up here doing work or relaxing with a book, chances are pretty good that at some point I'll have to use the bathroom being that coffee and tea are diuretics and all. So, what then? I'm not sure and luckily I haven't had to find out. But just a heads up, pee before you come here and then leave before you have the urge to go again."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2017-04-28,4.0,"Ground Central is a modestly sized cafe that, as its name indicates, is not too far from Grand Central (I'm kind of embarrassed at how long it took me to realize that pun!).  We decided to stop in while I was looking for a caffeine fix, and I thought the coffee was good.  I tried their Americano and thought that the espresso was not overly acidic or bitter.  The staff was friendly and approachable, and if I worked or lived in the area, I could see this cafe becoming one of my standbys.  

There's not a lot of seating, so I'm not sure if this would be ideal for a work spot/extended reading cafe (though I think you could make it work).  They do offer a selection of baked goods from local bakeries (though the doughnut I got was a tad stale)."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2019-08-09,4.0,"Great coffee with attentive staff. The only downside is the noise, I wanted to have a work phone call here but the music was so loud that I had to find another place. Three people next to me were having a conversation about work, seemed like some informational interview, and they were yelling to each other. Maybe is a tactic to stop people lingering and using this place as an office? You never know :)"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2016-12-13,5.0,"Bf and I desperately needed a hot drink to warm up our hands because it was such a cold and windy afternoon.
Bf got a soy chai latte and I got the Almond Mocha.

I wanted to steal his chai latte because it was so good.  It's one of the best chai lattes I've had in the city.  There was just enough cinnamon and a decent amount of ginger spicy goodness.  It was a bit sweet, but the sweetness didn't deter us away from the quality of the drink. 

The Almond milk mocha was delicious.  I felt like I was drinking quality dark chocolate.  No additional sugar was added or needed.  The drink was very smooth and the shot of espresso was just what I needed.

On another note, the barista was very nice.  I throughly enjoyed chatting with her as she was making the drinks."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2017-11-08,5.0,"EXCELLENT. I really don't have much else to say. My supervisor recommended this place to me, and I am SO glad that he did. I love it! The coffee is AMAZING. Unfortunately, the coffee is quite expensive, but I'd say it's worth it to treat yourself every once in a while!

This particular Ground Central location is quite small and doesn't have much seating, so that's a bit of an issue especially if you're trying to meet someone there...but not to worry! If the weather permits, there's a little park nearby that you can walk to and enjoy your coffee at!!"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-01-13,5.0,"The aroma of the coffee lured me in, searching for that morning fix but bought a hot chocolate instead. You average neighborhood coffee shop with bold industrial styling complimented with dark earthy colors throughout. 

It was pleasing to see that the staff remembers 4 out of 5 orders from their regulars that came in. I'll be sure to stop by when in the area."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2019-11-22,5.0,"Always incredibly fast and delicious. It's nice that they remember my order, too. Highly recommend, specifically the peanut butter latte."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-05-11,5.0,Discovered Oat milk here!  how can I ever have anything other than Oat milk now?!? Tried a chai tea latte with Oat milk and OMGEEEEEE IT WAS DEEEELICIOUS! Now I gotta go alllll the way back to NC and find Oat milk! Luckily this spot was less than a block from my hotel so I can had a nice (early) night cap!
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2017-01-05,4.0,"Ground central has become my go-to morning coffee place. The staff in there are always nice and super efficient during the work week.  

Highly recommend their house coffee, the pumpkin chai!, their lattes, and their iced coffee!"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-07-14,5.0,"They make an excellent cortado! Came in on a Saturday morning to be greeted with oldies playing in the background, friendly workers, and an overall welcoming atmosphere. This was exactly where I wanted to be to start my day.

Will return again when my work sends me out here."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-03-28,4.0,"A solid choice for non-traditional chain coffee. The staff probably serves hundreds of people a day, with the United Nations and Grand Central being in close proximity, but still takes the time to remember your order. I'm amazed because I only come in maybe once or twice a week. A coworker of mine, even less, and they remembered her drink, as well. The baked goods are just as good as the coffee and although small, if you get an opportunity to sit down and relax before you start the crazy work day, I highly recommend it."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2019-07-26,4.0,"The coffee is good and they have a good selection of baked goods. However, you feel very rushed. I understand they're trying to keep the line down, but I have felt like I haven't actually had time to look at the food choices by the register before they're barking at me to tell them what I want. It's as if you should know exactly what you want before arriving. Also, they've given me the wrong drink two times now because they are so rushed. Slow it down by 20 seconds."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-03-07,4.0,"Fantastic chai latte and great friendly service. It's a little pricey for my taste but better alternative to Starbucks! The space is small inside, just FYI!"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-01-06,5.0,Boyfriend loves the strong espressos here.  I enjoy the chai lattes and very fresh lemon loafs. The service is always very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is small and cozy. There's another location in the fifties that is bigger and has much more seating room. But this is a solid choice. Prices are steep but I always feel better consuming goods from here than Starbucks or Dunkins. PS. They also have mugs and tumblers for sale. Great option for a drink to go.
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2017-11-24,5.0,Love their iced coffee! Very small and cute coffee shop close to Grand Central. Reasonably priced coffee with lots of pastry options. Sometimes they have gluten free cookies. They have gluten free oatmeal and gluten free granola too!
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2016-12-09,5.0,"This is my neighborhoods spot for a coffee fix and a big respite from the usual chain-run coffee places. I especially love the vibe of this place and that they have some of the best roast that I have had.
I usually get the cappuccino but today the ""chai latte"" compelled me to write a review- which is probably the best i have had in the city, in terms of the level of sweetness and the overall flavor. Initially i couldn't decide if I wanted chai latte or black tea and the man behind the counter was kind enough to go through every tea flavor with me along with his own personal inputs on it. Loved the personal attention! 
They have some really good baked goodies , muffins and scones are especially nice!
Also, if you download and order via the ""cups"" app which is an app to promote the local roasters in town, you get 15% off every order over here!"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2017-08-21,5.0,"Come here if you are craving for a delicious, artisan bread type treats but hate the greasy, saran-wrapped pastries sold at Starbucks. 

Cheese brioche, ham and cheese croissant,  egg frittata sandwich were all excellent and warmed to perfection. Flavorful yet not greasy. 

Staff are all smiles and are eager to serve you. 

Really cute and cozy. I'll come back very soon!"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2016-05-19,5.0,"My new go to coffee spot!

Delicious cold brew. Finally non-watered down coffee!!!

I use the cups app so the price is reasonable. 

Also love the decor."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2017-05-02,5.0,"I drink iced coffee religiously as my religion.

And Ground Central has the best iced coffee I've had in the United States of America.

The end."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2017-12-07,5.0,"Ground Central is my go-to for coffee, baked goods, and incredible service despite the fact that there's coffee in my office and there are two coffee shops in my building. Everyone behind the counter is exceptionally friendly and happy to accommodate questions or make recommendations, and the coffee is perfect every time whether I'm in the mood for an Americano or a cold brew.

The space is smallish but still comfortably accommodates small groups for a casual conversation. I decided to finally write a review today because I tried the cheddar chive biscuit and loved it! It's fresh and buttery and flaky but not crumbly, and the deliciously cheesy chive flavor comes through with the perfect hint of mild spiciness."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2017-07-13,5.0,"If you are around the area, work near UN etc, you have to choose this place for coffee. The reason is the people who works there. The ladies are amazing including the owner who are all there every single morning to work, smile and greet us. I also tried their lunch sandwiches for the first time (PBA) and I loved it! 

I am pretty sad right now since I am moving to NJ and would have to miss this neighborhood coffee shop regularly. But you should not miss this coffee shop. Thank you again for everything ladies of Ground Central! See you all soon!"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2019-03-21,5.0,Popped in to Ground Central while waiting for my boyfriend in surgery next door and was pleasantly surprised with their extensive bakery selection and great coffee. The baristas working were very kind and happy to make food recommendations. Will definitely stop by next time I'm in the neighborhood!
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2016-03-02,4.0,"I seldom find myself in this area but I found this place that has seats and wifi so I decided to head in to get some work done and order some coffee.

First of I really love the decor on the wall. I should have known that good cafe usually has limited seats but I managed to find myself a table.. I ordered the mocha with almond milk.. Hands down one of the best mocha that I have ever had and I love coffee art on my coffee.. The espresso was strong but not over as if as I am gonna run a marathon.. It was also not as sweet (unlike Starbucks).. That's how I love the coffee.. I usually order cappuccino or latte but I need some sugar kick so I love adding chocolate to my coffee which means mocha but I absolutely dislike sweet chocolate syrup..

The wifi wasn't working for me but i don't really need it so I did not bother asking for the password.. 

I don't think I will come by often but if I find myself in this area I will definitely come to ground central again and order the flat white since that's what everyone is talking about!"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-02-28,5.0,Love the ambience and the aroma of coffee in the air! Will try the pastries next time! Let's see how quick!!
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2017-08-21,4.0,"Quality coffee, and fast service. Came here last Thursday for a quick bite and some caffeine before meetings at the plaza. Staff were friendly and fast. I came during the morning rush, and was rung up quickly but my sandwich was forgotten for 5 or 10 minutes and cold in the middle. The spot is also quite small with minimal seating; may be better served by stools and a small bar on the walls instead of the two sad tables. 

Other than  that this was a solid spot and the sandwich and coffee themselves were tasty, filling, and energizing. Will definitely stop here again next time I have a meeting in the area."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2017-11-17,5.0,"Great coffee. Always looking for options to Starbucks when in midtown for a meeting. Was looking for someplace with a good pour over option, but their drip coffee is as good as all that. 

The place is small and very busy in the morning, so be prepared with your order and payment and you will get out fine. 

And with great coffee!"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-08-23,5.0,"Although a small place, it's got wonderful coffee and incredible room-decoration (with a lot of books on the shelf!)"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2015-10-19,5.0,"Great spot! I found this coffee shop on yelp while staying in Midtown East. This place really stands out in an area saturated with Starbucks and dunks. I tried the flat white and my boyfriend had an iced latte, which were both some of the best we've ever had! We also each had a croissant. They were light, buttery, flakey, and better than most french bakeries.

The staff was welcoming and tried to get to know everyone that came in. I loved this spot so much I came back every morning and even purchased a mug!"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2015-06-24,5.0,"Finally- a great vibe coffee cafe in this area I want to keep returning to!
Super friendly service, great music and loved the art on the wall.
Chocolate croissant had a good, buttery taste- chocolate could have been more and better quality, but it was good.  Very generous pumpkin muffin samples!
The best thing was the latte -- think this was the best latte I have had in the city.  Not a hint of bitterness, perfectly smooth.  Served with a heart! :)"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-04-11,4.0,"Cute, cozy coffee shop. Not that big though. There's like two benches and a small table. We were still able to fit our stroller since it wasn't busy. Decent coffee with lots of non diary milk option. Nice wall mural."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2016-08-15,5.0,"Heh, i'm a sucker for clever naming.

But other than their brilliant name, their coffee is excellent. I usually never drink black coffee, but they recommended it and i slurped up every last drop. 

Good place to work/ study"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2018-06-23,2.0,"I ordered a matcha latte and cheddar chive biscuit here. I could not taste the matcha in the latte, and it was remade. The second one was just as disappointing as the first. Also, I asked the server to heat up the biscuit and it was returned to me cold. Extremely disappointing."
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2015-01-27,5.0,"Had a very rough day popped into this spot and it changed my mood completely. 
Heavy traffic outside but this place is a safe haven. Lots of speciality drinks inside. Cute for girls and college students on break"
939,ground-central-new-york-3,2016-11-08,4.0,Great latte and cozy dark interior.  They had a yummy assortment of pastries and sweets available too.  A few tables and seating inside too.  I'd pass on Dunkin Donuts and come here any day.
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2020-05-29,5.0,i went today to get a large chocolate sample gift box. due to covid-19. you cannot go inside of a store and navigate but the worker there can help you to explain everything you need. You will be standing outside of the store for the purchase. The worker there today was very helpful and friendly. He also gave me extra chocolate with no charge. hope to visit there soon after covid-19 and try other stuff as well.

940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2020-01-31,5.0,"Us Americans are largely unfamiliar with the Hotel Chocolat brand because it's British; this is on one hand unfortunate because the chocolate is amazing, but on the other pretty great because it remains sort of a cool secret. I believe this is the company's first U.S. location, and it's been open since 2018.

Hotel Chocolat owns their own cacao plantation in St. Lucia; actually, I became aware of the brand after visiting the plantation a couple of years ago. It's an amazing property, and you can tell immediately that it is a labor of love -oops, I'm sure they would spell it ""labour""- and that the company is committed to quality, sustainability, and employee experience. Taking a class there really made me think about where chocolate comes from and how much skill goes into making it.

The NYC shop has the same vibe about it, with friendly and passionate employees. You can definitely feel good about buying your chocolate here. They also serve coffee and chocolate-infused teas, and there's a small seating area. The hot chocolate is to die for, but beware- once you have it you'll never want to drink the run-of-the-mill instant stuff again. Also, don't even think about saying no to the chocolate whipped cream."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-12-14,5.0,"I love this place!

It was my first time visiting but it is so worth it! If you LOVE chocolate you have to go visit and get yourself some chocolate or a hot chocolate to go! It's delicious and a must try!

For Christmas they have advent calendars up. 

They also have a cute sculpture on display made from chocolate of ""Make Chocolate Not War""

This place is a must visit! I will definitely be back to try all of their various drinks!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-11-01,4.0,"They got so many flavor of chocolate!
Too difficult to decide what to get, wish I can just get all of them haha!
I tried their soft serve, its milk flavor with hint of coca taste. Not very creamy, but taste really good!
But that day was bit cold so I decide to get hot chocolate instead.
I tell them it's for stay. They put sooooo much chocolate whipped cream on the top. It taste super good. Not too sweet at all. And when you drink together. Perfect balance between cream and hot chocolate! Love it!
But actually I only can eat half of the whipped  cream, because they really give A LOT! 
so I ask for cup lid and bring together with me to go!

Definitely coming back to get the icecream or other flavor of beverage!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-10-13,5.0,"Chocolate. On. Chocolate. 

This is a gem of a spot for two reasons. One the chocolate is amazing. Two. The staff are just delightful. 

1. The chocolate here is so well balanced. My favorites are the ginger dark chocolate truffle. Gotta love me some ginger and the lemon shortbread chocolate made with white chocolate. 

Everything is so well balanced. Even the amazing blood orange drink. Look how cute and SPOOKY that orange chocolate stick is. The whipped cream is even infused with CHOCOLATE. Yum. 

Finally a big thanks to Sam and Tatiana and their entire staff who are so friendly. I loved learning about how chocolate is not the only product they sell. They even have beauty products. What? Yes. They smell amazing too!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-09-17,5.0,"My friend got me the cutest 150g chocolate puppy figure for my birthday and I just had to check out where it came from! 

Hotel Chocolat is a British fine chocolate company that really emphasizes their key differentiator from thousands other chocolatiers in the city. ""More cocoa, less sugar""--so far from trying just a few pieces of their chocolate confections I have to admit they're somewhat less saccharine than their competitors'. The milk chocolate is my favorite in general, and Hotel Chocolat's milk chocolate creations are worth the splurge!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-06-24,4.0,"Well the Sun is out and the temperature is up, so I am out walking around to see what I miss and I bump into Hotel Chocolat, no rooms just wall to wall chocolates.

Yelpers like the Hot Chocolate but it's 80 degrees plus so I opt for  ""ice cream of the Gods"" in a the tub, sounds big but its a small little cup.  And at $4.50 the Gods are selling it cheap, but they only made us one flavor, these Gods are a lazy bunch I say.

It is soft serve ice cream and the super helpful counter lady says it's made with skim milk and nibbles of cacao and offered it with a drizzle of caramel. It's a must to indulge and only 125 calories per cup, I need to watch my weight since lately my Yelping beside adding more reviews has added a few pounds too ;O

The ice cream is good, cold and the caramel is a good match for it and it didn't give me a sugar rush. Is it for the Gods ? well maybe on a hot day."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"The service is excellent here. Very welcoming and helpful staff. Chocolate was excellent as well. Highly recommend the hot chocolate. They have a nice seating area. I sampled a piece of their darker chocolate. Very good. They have their own plantation in St Lucia. They have a philosopy of "" More Cocoa, Less sugar, "" and you can taste that. It turns out that some chocolates are really sweet because sugar is cheaper than cocoa, so their philosophy is a good thing. Learned something new."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-05-08,5.0,"I am not a chocolate lover but when I was pregnant with my son, I craved it like nobody's business. I had to have something chocolate almost every single day. After my kid was born, I went back to my old ways of not craving chocolate. But my son on the other hand loves all things chocolate. As a tradition on Mother's Day, my husband will get a box of the finest chocolates for me and my son to enjoy together. 

This year, my husband got us a box from Hotel Chocolat, a British chocolatier in the U.K. It is our first time trying it and although I am not an expert on chocolate candies, I enjoyed these very much. One of my favorite pieces in the box was the Raspberry Smoothie. Another piece that stood out for me was the Florentine Isabelle. The praline on top just melted in my mouth offering a salty and sweet combo flavor. My son loved the few pieces he tried so far and said the Caesar praline mousse is his fave so far.

The moment you open one of these boxes from Hotel Chocolat, you are wowed with the look of each piece. The clean lines and colors are beautifully done. As I eat one and my son eats three, my happiness is seeing him enjoy these candies.

Because they grow their own cocoa on their own plantation in Saint Luica, the company's mantra is: ""More Cocoa, Less Sugar"". A much healthier way to enjoy these chocolates. 

Happy Mother's Day!!!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-07-18,4.0,"The service was excellent here! Came in around 8 on a Wednesday night and there was only a short line. Immediately when we got to the front the cashier apologized for the wait and thanked us for our patience (even though we had only waited a few minutes!) by the time we were done with our complicated order there was a line to the door. Sorry!!!! 

We ordered 5 ice creams to go. We also wanted a few with cones so the cashier suggested we put the ice cream into a bigger cup in order to fit the cone on it upside down which was a great idea. We got different toppings for each and they were delicious! The only thing we wished is that there was a little bit more ice cream in the cup. It seemed like such a small amount, but maybe that's us being gluttonous ! Lol. 
IMO it's more worthwhile to get the sundae they promote - it comes in a larger container with lots of toppings and mix ins and is only about $1.50 more. Next time I come here I'll definitely be trying that. The ice cream was fantastic and so was the service! Will definitely be returning!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-12-14,4.0,Finally got around to come here and try the chilled drinking chocolate after seeing it trending on Instagram. It is pretty good but wish the chocolate taste is more intense. I got the 70% dark chocolate - May try 85% next time or the sundae ? So many choices. Note there's not much seating area.
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-05-07,5.0,"Their hot chocolate is out of this world and now they also serve ice cream ""ice cream of the Gods"" - skim milk and nibbles of cacao.  It's a must to indulge and only 125 calories per cup.  
Shimella has a great personality and always makes me feel welcome every time I am their shop.  Thanks, Shimella!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-10-18,5.0,"I had some time to kill so I came to check out this chocolate shop and boy am I glad to have discovered this place! 

The staff was so welcoming and friendly. Not pushy but readily available if you need assistance. 

SO MANY OPTIONS. There's an entire wall dedicated to varying chocolate bars, truffles, and pralines. I stood there for a good 10 minutes debating which flavor I should get (any 3 for $18). Ended up with a Passion Fruit white chocolate bar, Fruity Collection truffles (these were such a delight: sweet and tangy), and Liquor Collection No. 1. I haven't tried the bar and liquor truffles yet but definitely looking forward to it.

Keep an eye out for a few chocolate options in baskets that are discounted 30% off because they're close to best by date.

After shopping around, do try their hot chocolate. I had the Blood Orange one and it was amazing with the contrasting cold chocolate whipped cream. Not too sweet or rich but the perfect mouthfeel that satisfies your chocolate craving without feeling too heavy. Just reminiscing about it makes me want another cup and I had only just finished one a few hours earlier. Pick up a loyalty card if you're planning to drink more than one cup!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2020-01-22,5.0,"So much chocolate ! 

But my friend told me to try the sofa serve and it was so good. It looks like heavy chocolate  ice cream but it is more milky cream and a hint of coco. My chocolate  cravings  were  satisfied and the small size didn't make me feel  guilty."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-09-23,5.0,"What a fun store!  Hotel Chocolat is not your average chocolate shop, although there is certainly nothing wrong with being your average chocolate shop!  From the visual merchandising to the cocoa-based products like candles and soaps, I have been to this store quite a few times, made purchases, and never even tried the candy.  The staff is friendly but not overbearing.

We got my best friend a cocoa-vanilla candle for her birthday from there a few months ago and found out while visiting this weekend that it hasn't been lit yet despite being on prominent display in the den.  Why not?  Because it smells and looks so good that she doesn't want it run out!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-02-27,4.0,"The place is small, but packed with a lot of quality.  It's a British brand and it's the first flagship in New York.  The menu is simple and complex at the same time.  For example, I ordered the Milky 50% which essentially means half milk and half milk chocolate.  I complied with the addition of whipped cream (they only serve chocolate flavored).  It's made fresh daily onsite.  

I wasn't sure what to expect since I prefer regular whipped cream.  The hot chocolate was good, but not overly rich.  The chocolate whipped cream with shaved bits of chocolate tasted slightly bitter, but surprisingly nice.  The napkins have elegant designs and they provide a cute plastic spoon to dig in.  In one corner and right to the left of the register are about three tables for patrons.  Their chocolates look delicious and elegant against the wall to the right of the entrance.  In the farthest left corner are their body, lip care, and bags.  They have amazing scents for the body butter and body lotions. 

The service needs work though.  Both of the employees encountered weren't the most professional.  Also the first employee automatically charged me for the large hot cocoa.  I asked her if this was for the large and why she had decided to go ahead with that charge when I never requested a large.  I did enjoy sitting down for a few minutes though."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-10-30,5.0,"Quick treat after interview during summer.

I'm SOLD. Highly recommended. The customer service was some of the best I've experienced. The store manager was so friendly and kind accommodating my questions as they were about to close around 8pm. She even threw in a few complimentary chocolates to congratulate me on my interview. Love her vibration.

I ordered a chocolate shake that was real chocolate with no fillers. I can't really go back to Shake Shack shakes after this! And I'm THRILLED that they are opening a store in the Columbus Circle underground market. Winter weight... here I come!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-02-26,5.0,"Living in NY, your taste buds can be refined with all the options available to the point of being picky.

When I read about Hotel Chocolat, I couldn't wait to try their award winning hot chocolate made from all chocolate.  It is located on the East side and close to Grand Central!  It's so far away and yet so close.

As you walk in the store, it's a wall of chocolate products on the right and left side with merchandise along another wall by the entrance.

I talk to an employee who gave me a sample of the dark hot chocolate and white hot chocolate since I am concerned that the dark would be too bitter and white would be too sweet.  Actually, both were perfect by itself.  She suggest I try the salted caramel.  It is perfect in the beginning especially with the Chocolate whipped cream.  However, midway through drinking the hot chocolate became a bit too sweet for me (too much of a good thing too fast).

I can't wait to go back and try the hazelnut hot chocolate and the regular chocolate drinks.  If you love chocolate, definitely come here and try their chocolate!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-10-07,4.0,"I've been wanting to try the hot chocolate here for a while and finally stopped by on a recent chilly day! I tried the salted caramel drinking chocolate with chocolate whipped cream. First of all, the whipped cream is amazing. Always get the whipped cream. The caramel flavor wasn't very strong, but the drinking chocolate was still very tasty. My friend got the ice cream here and I tried a bite and I would definitely recommend that too."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2020-02-10,5.0,"Went to the Galentine's Day Event and tried their Valentine's Day special concoctions. The Love Potion was definitely my favorite! It was so rich and thick. Warmed me up inside and the raspberry pieces gave a new twist to the original. The SweetHeart Sundae was amazing as well. The berry syrup with the raspberry and white chocolate bits added great texture and flavor to the already amazing ""Ice Cream of the Gods"". Out of all the chocolates offered, the PassionFruit Truffles were my favorite!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2020-01-17,5.0,I walked by Hotel Chocolat just after lunch. A friendly staff greeted me and I decided to try a cup of hot chocolate. The dark hot chocolate was indeed phenomenal!! Not too strong and just the right  amount too. Oh and the chocolate whipped cream on top. I strongly recommend it even if you don't get whipped cream usually in a drink.  It's like a light ganache and it goes so well with the drink. I'm so excited that it's such a short walk from work!
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2020-02-26,4.0,"I was seriously crave some sweets. And I found this place. They are definitely not sweet as other chocolate stores around, which I really love about it. Ironically their chocolate cream(whipping cream..?) on top of hot chocolate is my favorite. If that is the base of chocolate milkshake, I will definitely try those when the weather is nice."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-10-21,5.0,This place is awesome! I can't emphasize enough how friendly service is here and the quality of the chocolate. I purchased a hot chocolate and a milk and white chocolate bar and was not disappointed!! Both the chocolate bar and hot chocolate were nothing short of delicious. All chocolate lovers beware of this special store!
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2020-01-13,5.0,"Oh. My. Gosh.  I came here because I wanted a chocolate sundae and I got one.  The billionaire's sundae was one of the best sundae's I have ever had in my whole entire life.  The shortbread truffle on top is life.  Be warned though, it's big, and it's rich, so I'd recommend doing what I did and only eating half and saving the other half for later, and def have a drink on hand because it's so so rich you'll need some water.  Can't believe I found this place, def a hidden gem around the corner from GCS."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,This place carries an amazing selection of chocolate. Their hot chocolate and shakes are divine. You can even choose how much cocoa you want such as 75% or 80%. The hot chocolate is hot but not scolding hot so you can enjoy it more quickly. They currently have a chocolate statue of Godzilla sharing hot chocolate with King Kong and it's beautifully rendered. The employees are also very nice and helpful. They make the drinks quickly and are always asking if you have any questions or need help. The place has a few tables so you can sit as well so that's nice.
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-02-20,4.0,"I walked by this shop and was immediately drawn to the cute decor. The wall of 3 for $15 chocolates immediately jumped out at me since it was right before Valentine's day. The service was super friendly and I was able to pick out three packs of chocolates for myself and friends. 

As for the chocolates themselves, I didn't like all the flavors all that much. I appreciate that there were so many white chocolate options since those are my favorite. My boyfriend and I both didn't like one chocolate in the white chocolate variety pack and the other packs weren't my favorites either.

I will definitely be back to try the hot chocolate instead since there seem to be more rave reviews about it. The service and ambiance definitely make this a place worth visiting."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-07-14,5.0,"Holy Moly this place is amazing!!! I usually stay in the Bronx or lower east side for vacations so I'm usually in that area just discovering things, however, I stayed in the upper east side this time around and came across this amazing place! My family, BF, and best friend went in and the lady was kind and gracious and said we could sample some things however we were on a busy schedule and said we would come back. I'm glad we did I had ordered the salted caramel blended frappe with their amazing chocolate whip cream. It was really good and the prices are amazing. They currently have a sale 3 for 15 on their collections of chocolates and bars which was great. If I went to a Godiva or other commercial chocolate store they would have easily charged 25 for the 6 pieces. Great service, chocolates, and taste! Hundred percent recommend!"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-06-03,3.0,"Are all British chocolates unsweetened?

We came here because this place had great reviews but found the Ice Cream of the Gods and the 70% Dark Hot Cocoa extremely underwhelming. 

We saw them put a scoop of chocolate in the drink, but couldn't really taste anything other than bitter water almost. Maybe the 70% dark isn't milk based? It wasn't really good... not rich nor sweet at all. 

The ice cream was just mediocre too. At first, I thought it was whiskey infused, but really it's just not chocolatey I guess. Definitely creamier than the drink but still was a huge let down and did not satisfy my ice cream craving. 

The people there were nice though... we got there about half hour before they closed on a rainy day and though they only took cash, they still let us order."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-03-29,5.0,"If you looking for chocolate drink that not too sweet. Come here!

I'm glad I found this place!!! It's REAL cacao, not sugar drink. It's worth what you paid and price is not too expensive compare to quality. 

They have 4 small table for 2 persons inside.

I got 85% dark $4.90. It's awesome ^^"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-03-04,4.0,"Hotel Chocolat is a welcome addition to the Grand Central area. They offer a huge (and unique) assortment of chocolates! They also have a cafe area serving drinks as well as a wall with chocolate themed hand/body care. I am anxiously awaiting the soft serve machine to be open :) 

I work in the area and happened to walk by after work. The assortment of 3 packs for $15 chocolates caught my eye. I bought 3 packs as a gift for a friend's birthday and 3 packs for myself. I would highly recommend the strawberry cheesecake, millionaire shortbread and caramels! The only thing I wish they had some samples out for people to try before they buy - that usually will sway me into purchasing all the sample flavors haha."

940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-12-01,5.0,If you have a huge sweet tooth like me then you'll also fall in love with Hotel Chocolat . Their high quality and delicious chocolates make for the perfect gifts this holiday season. We had an incredible time learning from Lisa about single origin chocolates and tasting a variety of dark- milk- white chocolates! She was so knowledgeable and fun to learn from. We loved all of the chocolates we tasted as well as the sea salted caramel pecan chocolate dip. They also have other chocolate and chocolate + cheese tasting events so we will definitely be back here again To this beautiful and delicious chocolate spot.
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-02-03,5.0,"My cozy aesthetic demands hot chocolate on a cold winter's day and Hotel Chocolat more than delivered. I got the Milk Chocolate sipping chocolate and was visibly upset when I finished my drink half a block down from Hotel Chocolat. 

It was that good. 

The sipping chocolate is rich, but not sickeningly rich. Wonderful chocolate flavor and the whipped cream is an absolute must!  It's so fluffy and rich, kind of like an airy chocolate mousse sitting on top of your chocolate.  Even the service was sweet (I'll see myself out...)! I am definitely going to stop by again before winter's over to get another cup and maybe try one of their interesting chocolate selections."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-03-23,5.0,"Welcome to town, Hotel Chocolat. I sure hope you stay a while!

A few months ago my British colleague came into my office bursting with excitement and bearing chocolate. This is literally exactly how I wish everyone would come into my office. On that day, she was there to tell me about the HC that just opened near work. And I was all wassat? She just sighed ""Americans..."" and then told me that it was all the rage in England. 

I can see what they're on about. Some of the best hot chocolate I've had and with so many options! The most popular is 70% dark+milk, and it does not disappoint. They also have such flavors as salted caramel and mint, if you're feeling frisky. 

Their chocolate options are also amazing, with little packs of everything from chocolate covered kirsch cherries to white chocolate with fruit and nuts. There are also seasonal items, like the cute as can be chocolate lambs, rabbits and bunnies for Easter, and fancy boxes for gift-giving."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2019-03-16,5.0,"Variety of hot chocolates, Cocoa falovored whip cream (strongly recommend to add whip cream too) and VERY friendly staff

One of the best hot chocolates I've had in NYC. You can choose how sweet you want by selecting what percent of Cocoa you want, and that's new for me 

They had wide selection of chocolates (liqueur and non-liqueur) too, but we haven't tried em"
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2020-01-02,3.0,"I think that the chocolate is good.  The company consistently does half off sales around the time the products are about to expire and this is the time to purchase it.  I have consumed a lot of excellent chocolate and I can't consider the chocolate this company makes as great.  Yet, paying 50% for decent chocolate wasn't a bad experience.  It is double AA baseball compared to Neuhaus chocolate that is triple A which is located in the same location.  Overall not bad chocolate that I didn't have to pay a lot of money for, I will probably be back but I will only buy during a sale."
940,hotel-chocolat-new-york,2020-01-01,5.0,"The best hot chocolate in New York is Hotel Chocolat. The place is sparkling clean and I feel lucky that its so close to my place. The chocolate quality is amazing. I think because of the name Hotel Chocolat and its location has so many hotels that people dont think it is coffee place and that is why I dont see a lot of people there. Starbucks should learn from them how to put whipped cream on the cup. The baristas and the cashiers provide excellent customer service. Trust me, you won't regret a visit to Hotel Chocolat"

Mac n cheese was sadly not listed on Seamless or Grubhub. We called and they added it to their online menu for availability. They later called us to apologize for a delay because they needed to get ingredients from the store to make to fresh. When our food was delivered (25 minutes earlier than estimated!) the Jeffrey staff member hand delivered our order, again apologizing for the delay. This customer service during COVID times (not to mention in the pouring rain) was outstanding. Glad to support a local UES business and look forward to being back soon! Thank you to the staff at the Jeffrey!"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-05-13,5.0,"I had my birthday party here with about ~30-40 people on the back patio back in September. The whole day was so easy and chill, exactly how I wanted it to be. People came and went, everyone had their own tab, the server was amazing. Highly recommend this place for a relaxed, outdoor space to hang during the day for a drink. Huge beer selection, food was super yummy, and the staff was seriously amazing. Such an unforgettable day!

My guess is there is an NYC regulation about this, but the only thing missing is music outside :)"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-03-14,4.0,"Neighborhood bar with a huge selection of beers on draft, delicious food, and a bottomless brunch. 

There are two entrances, both with bars, and their is table seating in a main dining room as well, however all of the seating is on high-too stools. It looks like they are in the process of creating a patio in the back as well. 

I came with lunch with my dad and I got a cheddar pretzel and a roast beef sandwich with chips. It was all very delicious

941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-02-12,3.0,"As the name suggests, their selection of craft beers is excellent. And many are local. Win-win. Came in to enjoy a draft after work with a couple of old friends. The place was packed but we managed to grab three seats at the bar. The restaurant is U-shaped so if you don't see anything right away, keep walking toward the back and you might get lucky. 

The prices for pours are comparable to others in the area. The service at the bar can be slow because it is quite a long distance from end to end for the bartenders to travel. 

We had some snacks, as well. The highlight was the French onion Mac and cheese they had on special that day. It was served in a ~very~ shallow skillet, and topped with thick slices of baguette. There was more bread than Mac, but the flavors were delicious. We also enjoyed the rosemary seasoned potato chips and the pickle jar. Don't make our mistake in assuming we would be getting a jar of pickled cucumbers, but rather be prepared for a jar of mostly pickled cauliflower. 

Would return if I am in the area and need a dimly lit spot for a beer date or hang out but might not go out of my way to come back."

They have a wide variety of beers and they are constantly changing, even throughout the night. At one point they passed out new menus to everyone as they replaced the tapped kegs with brand new beers. I really enjoyed the sours that they have and cant wait to be back to try some more!

We also had some food here, not the best but I was more here for the beer anyways. The tacos are ok, the chili pretty good and the roast beef sandwich not bad. I enjoyed the chips to munch on as we drank!"

Super crowded inside which made for a poor experience. The outdoor space is really nice, but I don't know if it was the amount of folks, or what, but we were very poorly attended by our waitress. I might be back in a pinch, but low odds on that."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-02-11,4.0,"Cool spot located next to the Queensboro Bridge approach that felt like it had been there forever.

I tried a few beers off their extensive draught list, saison, stout and Belgian style strong ale, and really enjoyed them all. Nearly everything they offer is relatively local so you could potentially track down the brewery if you really enjoyed a pour, which I did. 

Staff was friendly and a good portion of the beers were $5 for happy hour which made it a fun and inexpensive stop.

They did have what looked to be an interesting food menu which I'd try next time along with their cocktails."

Not a big fan, so the server recommended Allagash. It's a can so couldn't try it but she was so confident I would like it so I gave it a try. She was right!! SO AMAZINGLY delicious!! 
I decided to go out on a limb and ordered the Flying Dog. Pretty good as well. Darker beer but very tasty.
To eat I had the burger. Most expensively disappointing burger I've ever had. Worth $5 not, not even. But it was worth $14 -_-. So that was a bummer. Plain burger with plain American cheese. I asked if I could have it medium rare but the server says it comes only cooked one way. Basically it came out well done. I got the trifle chips. Decent. So overall that's definitely a minus one star for food.
Service was fantastic!!
I'll be back for sure"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-06-26,4.0,"Holy Beer Bible Batman!  Our only mistake might have been visiting the Jeffrey the day prior to race day instead of following it.  They had a heavy list of numerous beers of all types and flavors.  Further, they had a solid cocktail list as well, which I tested with my order of the 'Not so Sweet' (well, it was called something along those lines).  Every drink, beer or cocktail, came with reasonable pricetags (some even non-NYC like!).

While enjoying my drink, we grabbed some small bites as well.  The pickle plate was a good portion for two to share.  I didn't love the Red Beet deviled eggs, but that is more related to my preferences as the dish is creative and heavy on the beet taste (vs deviled egg taste).

Service was solid.  We had a large group and they kept up.  We also had some beer questions and the bartender REALLY knew what she was talking about (as opposed to just pushing a certain beer or two).  I'll be back in future visits to NYC.  You should swing by as well."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-05-27,2.0,"I was excited to check this place out but sadly, it turned out to be a dud. The first time we were treated like a nuisance when trying to find a table. We gave it another shot and I wish we hadn't.

The service both times by the same female server was poor at best. She had a total attitude and acted inconvenienced by just about everything. She has the complete opposite personality of someone who should work in customer service. She's also the same person who made the first experience poor, too.

We ordered drinks and some chips and salsa. The guacamole was an additional $3 and it was a tiny amount. We all had to laugh at the small amount for $3, please see picture.

I asked for the check and signed the merchant copy. Before I could put a cash tip (which was undeserved), she took the check from beneath my elbows. What the hell? You're supposed to ask if it's ready or ask if you can take it. Don't invade my personal space.

You lost out on your tip and customers."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-10-14,3.0,"Drinks:
- lots of craft beers to choose from, and a good variety with a lot if styles I like
- I liked the saisons, the wheat and the hazy IPA
- the price for a flight and pints seemed high
- there's a ""cocktail lab"" where you can either sit and just get drinks or where they whip up speciality cocktails for seating in the rest of the joint

Food:
- they have bacon wrapped dates (!!), which are my fave. These come with a legit piece of Applewood bacon wrapped around each. Unfortunately the date and cheese inside are tiny. Suggestion to take these to the next level: use a bigger date and, hence, more cheese,  place them on a small bed of arugula, and drizzle it all in balsamic reduction.
- the potato leak soup, which was a generous portion size, came with cheddar toast that was basically a mini grilled cheese; perfect for dipping
- truffle oil is drizzled in the soup, and used for a number of other dishes on the menu - yum!
- the dressing on the side salad was delicious, but unfortunately the salad was swimming in it
- food was also a bit pricey

Venue:
- lots of places to sit and different rooms, including a beer garden
- beer garden closes early on week nights
- was a bit confusing on the seating and service approach because there's no one watching the front doors (there are two) and you can only see two narrow bars from the front

Service:
- minimally attentive waitress; she was very nice but spent half of the evening tucked into her little server booth staring at her phone"

The vibe was good. We had a super friendly but chill bartender. The place was packed. They had this weird movie Elizabeth playing that kept us entertained at time. Overall, looking forward to visiting this place again. 

There was a separate entrance for craft beers a craft cocktails, which was cool. Solid 4 stars"

they have a big selection and the environment was nice . The only thing that I didn't like about air circulation of inside. it needs more air in order to wave the smell of the food. 

As a beer I had pilsener. It was great as my beginner experiences. I also had a chance to have Tater tots. the taste of the food was good, but a bit crunchy overcooked. 

Hopefully until next time I would update my review and give them a five stars 

Thank you The Jeffrey Craft Beer & Bites"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-07-24,4.0,"I used to live pretty close to this place and having been here for the first time only a year ago, I was surprised I hadn't been here more often!  It's an excellent place to stop by for after-work drinks and their selection of various craft beers along with some quality wines and excellent cocktails is top-notch!  They have a cute interior and the bar was pretty packed the day we went.  That being said, there was a patio in the back that though it wasn't open at the time, seemed like a cool place to hang out on a summer night. 

I usually go with a rosé (because #RoséAllDay, obvi) or a cider but would definitely come back to sample some more things from the menu.  My greatest complaint with bars/pubs sometimes is that the quality of the light fare/snacks is often lacking but that's definitely not the case with the Jeffrey.  At a work happy-hour a few months ago, I shared pretzels with a friend and the dips are on point!  Though they have some other quality snack options, the true reason to hit up the Jeffrey is the alcohol, of course. 

Though I live a little farther away now, I'll definitely be stopping back!"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-04-22,4.0,"This is a neighborhood gem. The burgers are delicious, on the smaller side IMO, but packed with great flavor.

Ambiance.  So many interesting details that come together creating a cozy neighborhood vibe.  The industrial looking piping and overhead lamps with faucet handles at the ceilings were the cool detail I noticed the recent visit.  Two bars and seating in the back with community table and tables for 4.  TVs at the bar and in the back played a football game.

Food and drinks.

They have a large selection of beers, but the bartenders also make a fantastic cocktail. I am very particular about my drinks, and my mezcal, and they make an incredible mezcal old fashioned.  

Very good Casual food with the highlight of yesterday's being the truffle flavored wings.  Caution  - very hot! I (and my stomach) would prefer a little less hot especially since the spicy hot took from the really tasty truffle flavor after the first wing. But still very good. Chili while also very good - was so hot in temp that I had to wait about 20 minutes to eat it. Friend also enjoyed the burger. 

Service.  Our server while friendly, seemed to be the only one working and could have used some support as it was hard to get his attention as he waited on all the tables in the back area. 

Recommend as a casual cozy feeling spot to meet with friends for drinks and casual food."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-01-25,5.0,"My friend and I were wondering around this neighborhood the other day and we were looking for a place to rest our feet and I was starving, so we took a flyer and picked this place somewhat at random, and boy am I glad we did. 

This is a tiny little narrow bar that you could easily mess if you didn't know it was there. They have a giant selection of a very nice rotating tabs, a decent size menu of high-quality pub grub in a pleasantly rustic space.

We sat in the back outdoor patio where you can self-serve water and hang out on the high top tables. It was the perfect aftern"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-06-28,4.0,"I recently moved to the neighborhood and my boyfriend and I will definitely be coming back! 

Food/drinks - Tons of craft beer/cider options! Food was good but nothing to write home about. We ordered the pretzel to share (YUM!), burger and 2 tacos (not sure why there is a two taco minimum when each taco is listed on the menu as a single price of $7, it is a little misleading/I really would have enjoyed one taco)

Staff- Super friendly! They were great about letting us know about what time last call was going to be for food and drinks so we really appreciated that. Quick service for it being really busy.

Atmosphere - There is a back patio which is awesome but unfortunately it closes on the earlier side at 9pm and then you need to move inside. You can go from having a table to not having one when you move inside. Overall chill vibes!"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-12-08,2.0,"These idiots give away business by halting delivery services at peak hours. Hey Jeff, here's a bold idea: figure out your peak hours, then hire a guy to do deliveries during that period! Profit-y results! Happy customers who don't curse your name every time your restaurant shows as ""closed"" on Seamless. 

ps, lose the SJW vibe as well. People come to eat and drink, not for a secular sermon."

I came here on a Saturday afternoon to meet up with a friend, as we wanted to be outside since it was so beautiful out. The Jeffrey has a nice patio out back for just that. While you wont get the great views of a rooftop, the have a nice spacious seating area in the back so you can be outside drinking without those horrible rooftop prices. Their beer selection is large and theres a little bit of everything, most running $8 each. The service was friendly and attentive and overall it had a great atmosphere. The food that I saw walking around look very good, but cant attest to it at all since we did not order any"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-05-09,5.0,Stopped in this evening for a nightcap. I've always had a thing for this place. They generally have a great selection of beers on tap (had both my first Hill Farmstead and Bissel Brothers beers here) and the atmosphere is laid back. I love the copper bar and brick walls. Occasionally it's too busy for my taste but it's never really busy late night. It's definitely a place worth checking out if you like craft beer.
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2018-08-13,4.0,"Located at the end of the block on 60th st, the establishment offeres some great craft beers with deliciousness you can't refuse. Bartender and the satff were quite friendly. Had I lived around the corner, this would definitely be my go to place on a daily basis. 
For beer lovers, it's a must visit if you are in the area. Cocktails & whiskey are also part of the list you can find here. 
Ambiance is cozy, comfortable but, something about it almost feels romantic.
There are two separate sections of full bars and hightop seating in the back room. Outdoor space is also a huge plus in the rear.  
Bites such as pretzels and charcuterie plates were reasonably priced and delicious.  Can't wait to return again!"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-02-02,4.0,"We came to The Jeffrey after taking the tram over to Roosevelt Island for a few hours. We were looking for a pub-style dive bar with good food, and I think we found it! They have an extensive alcohol menu with the funniest captions. In fact, the whole menu is pretty hilarious. The atmosphere is dark, bit cozy. Got louder and louder as our lunch went on, but we didn't feel rushed to leave. Got some great beers - prices are fine. It looks like in the summer they have an outdoor area. Our waitress was a little strange, she was good but kept cutting us off and seemed quite short and curt. Not quite sure why she was in such a bad mood but whatever. I got the Caesar salad with buffalo shrimp and 5 measly tiny shrimp came.....it was an extra $7, that means it was more than $1/shrimp. Pretty disappointing. Also, our appetizer came out at the same time as our food which kind of defeated the purpose lol. My friends got the pressed turkey sandwich which they said was delicious."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-08-28,3.0,"Great extensive beer selection (with several cocktails as well for those who aren't ""beer people""), but the service really suffered. The back patio gets crowded on Friday nights so the servers are understandably busy, but they were unreasonably hostile to all the guests. Drinks took so long to come out that by the time we got them, we wanted to leave. I would recommend avoiding this place during peak hours and with large groups, and definitely staying indoors by the bar instead of at the patio."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-03-24,4.0,"Always really enjoy this place! Usually quite crowded on Saturdays especially when the weather is nice- they have a great outdoor space in the back with five or so picnic tables and a good amount of seating.

For me, the vibe here changes with the seasons and what you come here for (which I like). In the summer and spring, you come for the outdoor space and it's always lively and fun, with music and good (younger) crowds enjoying the weather. In the winter, the bar is very much cozy and dimly lit at night, with the same good music but maybe a little less ""young"" of a crowd. Though still very lively.

Most recently came here on a Saturday around 6 with friends. Ordered a bottle of wine and the cheese board. Really love the cheese board here - it comes with a good variety of hard / soft cheeses (including a really good blue cheese that's not too funky). Have had many other apps here in the past and have never been disappointed ! Great neighborhood spot."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-09-04,5.0,Great beer and full bar to boot. They let you sample everything and serve beers in style specific glasses so you know the bartenders and owners have a built in notion of what good beer is and how it should be offered to their customers. Few TVs and lots of bar seating. Really like the vibe of this place with old school counter but new school service like free chargers for your phone. Not sure I'd ever make a pilgrimage but if I'm the area you can't go wrong at Jeffrey if you enjoy good beer.
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-09-17,2.0,"Beer selection was pretty varied. Happy hour choices were limited. I tried one beer there that was fantastic. Nice patio in the back but it gets very uncomfortable there.

The food disappointed me. It was just very average. The mushroom sandwich was pretty flavorless."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-02-04,5.0,"The Jeffrey is a great pub with a big outdoor space, large selection of beer and delicious food. I've been twice and this last time had the Impossible burger - which comes topped with guacamole and a fried egg neither mentioned in the description. That was one tastefully, messy brunch meal! The egg was cooked to perfection with the yoke breaking all over. I'm not a fan of kale so whatever fell on my plate was then mixed in with the salad. That even made kale edible. Lauren and Holly were great taking care of all in our big party! Thanks, The Jeffrey!"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-08-03,4.0,"Would rate this place 3.5 stars. This place has a nice backdoor patio/outside beer garden and an expansive array of craft beers. You can pick any beer with a plane next to it (aka flight) on the menu to include in your three 5oz glass flight which is great. Most beers on their menu have planes next to them but our server even put a few that didn't in my flight to help customize my experience. Much appreciated. Although you can tell the servers are super busy as they often disappear for long periods of time. They also never brought my friends water (even though we asked twice). The bar bites themselves are a little overpriced but not bad by any means. My favorite was the bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates, which were the perfect blend of salty and sweet. I had the OG burger which was good, but nothing to write home about. My husband had the meatless version of the OG burger and thoroughly enjoyed. In addition my friend had a salad with some type of truffle oil dressing which she loved. Cute beer garden, given its proximity would consider returning."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-02-18,5.0,"Thaddeus is a very personable, eclectic, and knowledgeable bartender. From my first introduction to him by coming late night after a shift, it was like I knew him for like years. He's very easy to talk to and if the man wasn't into improv before I truly believe he has a knack for it LOL. 

He's the head bartender at The Jeffrey and helped curate  the entire drink menu and may I say *twirls handlebar 'Stache and sips Lionstail drink* delightful. 

I'm a ginger girl, so the stonehead(?) and the Lions tail are my go to drinks. It's a smooth drink that the alcohol is barely detected but oh baby it's there. As a member of the lightweight committee ya girl feels it. Drink three I'm living. 

On my second visit with another coworker, we purchased food and shared the turkey sandwich. Delicious. Small. But I honestly like how it tastes so much I don't mind the price. What I DO MIND, is the fact that they don't serve French fries, they serve chips (rosemary/sea salt). Potatoes are cheap my good Jeffery, through some rosemary fries or sea salt fries on that menu and we got a match! Even without the chips-which taste fine- I'd still come back. It's just the chips are so small and I feel hungry still afterwards.

Which brings me to say, if you're a girl who likes to eat like myself, you're gonna have to order multiple things to get full here. The flavor is great, the food is good but the portions are small (4/5* rounded up from 3.75/5) 

Overall 5 stars just because of Thaddeus giving life to this place in each of my experiences. Even when the bar is full and I'd sit at a table in the back, he's dope.

3.75/5 or 4/5 if I'm rounding for the food. 

Great little spot with UES prices that's actually worth it.

Enjoy"

The bartender on the café side of the restaurant was so attentive and friendly. He even made up custom cocktails based on our preferences while juggling the coffee rush. My friend can't stop talking about one that he made with some maraschino liquor. Holy smokes that was good. I also got to try what I believe to be the most delicious Bloody Mary in NY! Thank you kind bartender, we enjoyed chatting with you!
The food is great, everything we had on their brunch menu was delicious and really hit the spot. Try the turkey sandwich. Big hit with us!

Well above-average and often creative but not crazy food (excellent burger, pho tacos, devils on horseback, red beet deviled eggs) as well and a solid spirits selection, with well-made cocktails."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2018-12-11,3.0,"My friend and I came here on a Friday night looking for a fun but chill place to have a drink.  The layout of the place is a bit weird; shaped like a horseshoe, the two sides have separate bars, and the back area has tables to sit.  We were able to snag a spot at the end of the communal table in the center.

Because the space is so small and gets packed on the weekend, table service was VERY slow.  Plus, you can expect to be pushed a lot if you're seated at the communal table by people trying to get by you.  It quickly became unpleasant, so I switched seats to what would hopefully be a better spot, which it was for a brief period of time.

Shortly after getting our drinks, a HORDE of people who look like they just got out of some professional conference (all wearing badges and carrying bags that read 'Because Hamilton') infiltrated the back seating area and things got ridiculous.  Being shoved was no longer just a possibility, it was a guarantee.  Although the rudeness of other patrons should not reflect poorly on the establishment, I was very peeved that the bouncer did not think to do crowd control when 50 people showed up at the same time to an already crowded bar.  We quickly paid our bill and got up to leave, at which point, our waiter apologized for how ""crazy"" it got.  The apology was much appreciated, but still, a disappointing experience overall."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2018-12-08,4.0,Thursday was my first time at the Jeffrey. I really enjoyed their selection of beers and service was good. It gets pretty crowded here and the walkway to get to the back area is very narrow. They do have happy hour until 7pm.
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2020-04-30,5.0,"Very sad that Bird & Branch is temporarily closed, especially because they are still just a young business (I remember coming here the first month they opened!) I went online and realized they have this #GiveCOVIDTheBird campaign that's genius! You can go online and order food for hospital staff on their website. I did it and received this amazing email confirmation back... with photos of where the food went! I am just so happy and impressed with their level of follow-through. So glad to call this ""my coffee place."""
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2020-01-29,5.0,"Normally I don't do Yelp reviews, let  alone one while sitting at the place but I felt the egg sandwich with the added  accouterments was worth mentioning. Delicious. The only photo I could post would be an empty plate, since I enjoyed it too quick to capture. 

The coffee here is great as well. The signature coffees all have a unique flavor to them that compliments the roast. Great spot. Nice folks."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2020-02-13,4.0,"I heard a lot of great things about this cafe, especially their house-made macadamia milk, which was highly praised by my friends. I wasn't able to try said milk due to my allergy but I have ordered other drinks. Their menu features really creative drinks named after birds to keep with the theme of the cafe, and they're a hit for the most part.

I feel pretty conflicted about the Starling ($5.50), a carbonated, cold-brew hojicha, which I felt was quite terrible upon the first sip. It reminded me of stale, gas station coffee that was supercharged with seltzer. I honestly wanted to throw it out but I soldiered through and a third of the way in, something incredible happened. Despite my fried taste buds at this point, I started to taste the nutty, dark, smoky flavors of hojicha. The creamy undertones were overpowered by the bubbles so it became a deep, caramel-like tea with a citrusy aftertaste. Overall, it was good, but also not good-- definitely not for everyone.

For a less polarizing choice, I would recommend the lychee perilla lemonade ($4.50). It started out as a seasonal drink but has since moved to their menu, which was a great move. It's light, refreshing, and literally perfect for any weather. While the lemonade has a very floral taste that is distinctive to lychees, the grassy, minty flavor of perilla leaves was a little more subtle to grasp. I would recommend if you like the combination of sweet and bitter."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2020-01-15,5.0,"I've had this place bookmarked for awhile but happened to pass it one day and decided to finally try and I am so glad I did because I still have dreams about the sesame ginger egg sandwich with the pork on it. The flavors were like nothing I've ever tried before and they all melted together so seamlessly and the textures were amazing. 

I also ordered the almond-macadamia house made milk latte, which I was initially hesitant about because I don't normally like almond milk in coffee. I decided to try it though because their other specialty drinks were already pre-blended with dairy milk, unfortunately. I'm glad I did try it though because their almond milk was so creamy and delicious. As an added bonus, everyone working there was super friendly and they even pulled up a chair by the bar for me because it was super crowded. I can't wait to come back."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-11-23,4.0,"Pretty cute coffee shop with interesting drinks! The store inside is quite small however they do have outdoor seating (which consists of park benches). For those looking to take pictures, i would say this is the place hahahaa. 

as for drinks, i got the blackbird which is a latte with blackberries. it was pretty good!"
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-12-22,4.0,The matcha brownie along with the matcha latte delicious. The cafe was pretty small but cozy and modern. The items were a bit overpriced but to be expected for a cafe in New York City. I would definitely go back for the macho brownies and to try other items.
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-08-24,5.0,"This is one of my top favorite coffee shops in NYC. It's one of the most instagramable spots for coffee and great presentation. If you have time, get it to stay and it's even cuter! During warm weather months they have a great little outdoor street seating area which is usually mostly in the shade. The owners are great and the service is always outstanding! 

Go here if you're looking for great instagram pics and specialty coffee drinks!"
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-04-12,5.0,"Innovative drinks for coffee and non-coffee drinkers, freshly baked kouign amanns, croissants, teas, unique toasts, friendly staff-- this coffee shop has something for everyone! 

I've been here ~3 times, and have tried several items:
- Nori Avocado Toast 5/5, lots of umami flavor
- Blackbird 5/5 espresso with macadamia milk and blackberry jam, not overly sweet, lactose-intolerant friendly. I am not a coffee drinker, but this espresso is so good, that I willingly compromise my non-coffee drinking identity :) 
- Matcha Latte w oat milk 5/5, standard matcha latte but their oat milk is made in house and delicious
- Sparrow 5/5 sparkling hojicha. If you like a refreshing tea, this is the perfect coffee alternative.
- Chocolate orange kouign amann: 5/5 so good that writing about it has already made my mouth water

My only qualm to this coffee shop is that there is no restroom, but I'm usually able to sneak into a restroom across the street or around the corner. 

Definitely will be back. Thanks Bird & Branch!"
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-11-03,5.0,"BARISTA WITH SLAYER CRAFTS SUPERB COFFEE
Cozy cafe with indoor and outdoor seating. The barista makes a great cortado and the B&B brews single origin coffees and ippo teas. Their avocado toast made with multigrain bread was luscious.  They have a custom made ""Slayer"" espresso machine. Made in Seattle this is  the USA answer to Marzocco and when in the hands of a skilled barista like B&B's makes a great extracted espresso with nice ""crema""!"
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-04-25,5.0,"Came here for breakfast and got both the miso hummus and the nori avocado toast, with a pot of loose leaf Hojicha tea.

Service was friendly and unpretentious. The hot tea really hit the spot and went well with the toasts. Both the toasts were excellent (quality + portion size) but the avo toast was the winner of the two.

There's not a lot of seating inside, but plenty of natural lighting.
The bird theme of the cafe is also quite charming. Will def be back again for more tea and toast!"
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-06-13,4.0,"The flight is the best way to try their espresso, espresso with steamed milk, and hot and cold coffee. Three different types of beans: Honduras, Bolivia and Columbia. Nice for $8. 
Oh- don't forget the sesame cookie that comes with it. Looks like a rock, but it's to balance the coffee. 
Avocado toast isn't the best I've had... bread crust too hard and overall the slice should be thicker to balance the richness of the avocado. 
Neighborhood feel, just watching locals streaming through, sitting and chatting over coffee."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-10-25,5.0,"Every time I go out of town, I hope that there is a nice coffee shop right next to where I'm staying. This trip: Bird & Branch for the win!  Prices are typical upscale coffee shop style, but at least you get a quality product for what you pay. I was impressed enough to go back for afternoon second coffee instead of trying one of the other close by places. 
As for pastries, the kouign-amann is all you need to know about. I had the plain, but there are other delicious flavors. Think, slightly sweet croissant. My wife got the everything croissant. It has jalapeño cream cheese inside. Also really good. 
Thank you NY."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-09-03,5.0,"The short: Rich, flavorful coffee with a socially positive goal and a kind vibe.

The long: Bird and Branch has been on my list of cafes in the city to visit but they just aren't close to Harlem whatsoever. Then, this summer, our lease ended and I've been bouncing around to different friend's houses while we wait to move into our new apartment. My coffee-making supplies are all packed away in storage and I have been making do with free coffee at events or random gritty corner coffee shops. Finally our lodging adventure through the city brought us next door to B&B and I just had my first cup of their St. Frank's Burundi Ninga Hill roast this morning. Let me tell you, it soothed my soul and gave me life. Don't you dare drink it with milk or sugar. It is perfect as is."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2020-02-21,4.0,"This is a cute cafe! I went here last month during late January as I was waiting to eat dinner with friends at another restaurant. It was so warm and cozy here. The first thing I noticed here is the corner of merchandise. I actually want a shirt or a tote bag (haha). There is some seating here but it can easily get occupied (on a Friday evening, at least!). The barista who took my order that day was so kind. I ordered a matcha latte and it was amazing and velvety. I also like the latte art. I will come back and try their other beverages."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-04-10,4.0,"After doing my Yelp research on cafe spots in Hell's Kitchen, this one peaked my interest with its classic and unique, signature coffee drinks, pastries, and toasts. I came here to hang out with 2 other friends. The noise level was not bad, and despite sitting a foot away from our neighboring table (yay nyc) I didn't feel claustrophobic. Sitting space is pretty limited, so if you're a student who needs to take up more space than a standard laptop, look elsewhere. 

We got an Americano ($3.50), Miso Hummus ($8), and Matcha Latte ($5). The drinks were pretty standard, but I really loved how they served their drinks with metal straws (woo save the turtles!!). Their hummus toast was great -- the bread was a thicc (yes 2 C's) cut and had a nice hummus-to-toast ratio."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-08-18,5.0,I love everything about here! I wish it was a lot closer to me and that I would be in this area more often. Worth the trip even when I came from Staten island haha. Loved the Nightingale so much!!!!!! This decor was also super cute and bright. Really made my day. Love love love the whole eco consciousness with the beautiful metal straws too.
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-10-09,4.0,"Cute little coffee shop near Times Square! There's not much seating inside so it's pretty cramped, but nothing out of the ordinary for NYC. I got the nightingale, which is essentially an upgraded earl grey latte, and really enjoyed it! There's a nice little kick of earl grey without being too overwhelming. My only qualm is that it's only offered with whole milk because the tea has to steep and I prefer non dairy milk. My friend got the seasonal special, a black sesame latte, and liked it as well."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-09-07,4.0,"I got espresso and they gave seltzer and I didn't have to ask for it. After my brother showed me the ideal way to drink shots of espresso, I always need seltzer now. You pay $4 with a tip but it is worth it. No horrible after taste but only accents from the beans. If I could wake-up each morning to this I would be a very happy human, I just might be poor. 
Not an ideal spot to do work but a cool outdoor seating area. 
Go Bird & Branch!!"
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-07-30,5.0,The squares (pastries) with black sesame/matcha/brownie flavor are so good! This cute coffee shop between 8/9 avenue on 45th street also has vegan and gluten free loaf/cake. My latte of housemade macadamia almond milk is a bit pricey for ~$6 but again house made (squeezed) milk. It has other interesting coffee/matcha combos that make you feel like you are not in the noisy touristy area! Best in midtown west!
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2020-01-11,5.0,"Brandon and Mary slung some bangin 'spro, we're super kind and helpful. 

My husband got the flight and loved it. I got a mocha with their house made almond/macadamia nut milk, it was delicious! Also their earl grey shortbread was a great little sweet to finish everything. 

Thanks guys, we'll be back."

942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2020-01-13,5.0,"Got the iced matcha latte with their house-made, non-dairy almond & macadamia (?) milk -- really good. Also love that they use metal straws for to-stay orders. Their nori avo toast was pretty good as well.

Overall a good place to come and get some work done. Excited to come back and try more things!!"
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-06-23,5.0,"Wow, a black sesame brownie?!? Jaw droppin' deliciousness!!! It was the perfect brownie - lightly dense but full on black sesame flavor. So happy to have been introduced to this spot.

This place is more for the grab & go. There are a few seats if need be. Loved the clean chic atmosphere & the staff is great w/ recs. This place is def a hidden gem in the Theater District. Now I have a new go to spot in the area, yes!"
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2018-12-21,5.0,"I can't believe a quality neighborhood cafe as good as this exists just blocks away from the Times Square/Port Authority madness! What a fantastic spot for delicious drinks and lighter fare.

Their signature drinks are really cool, with lots of interesting ingredients for a little variety from the norm. I tried the blackbird, which has to be one of the most unusual and delicious lattes I've had. I believe blackberries made their way into the mix (the ingredients are listed in the store), giving it a fruity, tart flavor under the creamy latte texture. Really good stuff!

I also had a cappuccino, which was delicious; very smooth without any bitterness. It seems like the cafe prides itself on its coffee, going so far as to offer flights so you can taste all the different beans being used. The staff (owners?) who helped me out were incredibly kind and happy to talk about their products in a helpful way.

Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area and looking for an excellent coffee shop that caters to locals!"
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-12-19,4.0,A very quiet and cute place to have a small get together with friends. I personally am not a huge fan of the matcha latte. I think it taste like warmed up milk but overall I would come back and try other things.
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-12-29,5.0,"Adorable and cozy coffee place in Hell's Kitchen. They have gluten-free and dairy-free options if that's your thing. I tried and loved the mango, honey chia pudding."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-08-03,3.0,"Really cute place with inventive and tasty drinks. Was a bit underwhelmed by the macadamia milk (would have preferred my standard oat / almond) and $8 ($7 + $1 tip) is a lot for an iced latte, but nevertheless, it was delicious and I enjoyed it. I had the blackbird, which in addition to the milk and espresso, has blackberry jam in it. Not too sweet and decently refreshing. Definitely won't say no to a second trip but wouldn't go out of my way for this place."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-08-08,4.0,"Creative, delicious drinks.  Good service.  A little on the pricey side.

Nightingale (blackberry latte with thyme):  Really tasty, though a little bit rich and sweet. 7/10.

Dirty Horchata (almondmilk horchata with an espresso shot): Cold, refreshing, light, comforting, and well-spiced.  7.5/10."

Really nice in warm weather for a place to sit outside and people watch ;)
On this day I had the sesame latte which didn't disappoint.  They use a nice rich espresso and also offer lots of tasty sweets if your into that."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-08-02,3.0,Needed my coffee fix from a cute coffee shop so found this place while I was trying to yelp places near my hotel. I got the nightengale which had Earl grey in the coffee brew. Pretty interesting in a good way! The coffee needed additional sugar to it since it was alittle bitter. I also got the everything crossiant filled with jalapeno cream cheese. Yummm. This was the best part of my breakfast. Delish. Like the coffee but wasn't really my thing. Def. Worth a try!
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2018-11-08,4.0,"There are so many nice restaurant around Hell's Kitchen , but I always feel not enough nice and stylish cafe around there.
But finally I meet here this new cafe in my hood! 
I usually use the to-go Mexican right next door and found cute sign and interior that really stand out in this block however they didn't open yet. And I was so excited about  opening! 

I was so happy to have this opportunity to have this coffee tasting event! 
I'm actually not really coffee person, but I always curious about the taste of coffee since they have so many type of beans and roast...and origin..

Here, this cafe is best learning coffee and beans.
The owner and stuff are really kind and knowledgeable coffee and some other beverage.
They deal the coffee beans from San Francisco and also have most excellent n famous matcha  brand ""ippodo"" in Japan 

I trusted their taste and selection very well.

Additional  remarkable  point is sweets!
I can't stop eating their sesame browny and matcha as well. I'm usually not so interested in Peanuts butter, but their cookies were an exception! 

Home made almond macadamia milk latte also great ! 
If weather is nice, sit outside table on the street side!"
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2018-11-23,5.0,"I've been craving avocado toast lately and am so glad I found this place! It's very small and cozy, and put me in such a good mood after braving (walking) through the cold.

I actually didn't get to try their Nori Avocado toast because they didn't have avocados when I came in, but the Miso Hummus was so good! I usually don't eat tomatoes (hate it), but it went so well with the miso hummus that I left no tomatoes behind. The thick toast was topped with miso hummus (very flavorful), tomatoes, and olive oil. It's perfect-- I wouldn't change a thing! 

I also ordered the Yuzu Ricotta toast, which was very light in flavor. The yuzu topping was slightly sweet, and I think I could've used more yuzu on my toast, but overall this wasn't bad. If I had to pick just one toast, I would go with the Miso Hummus.

I love all things matcha and black sesame so of course I ordered both brownies! The matcha and black sesame brownies were denser than a regular brownie, but I really enjoyed the flavor!"
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-04-23,4.0,"Cute little place with pretty good coffee. Got their cappuccino which was good but nothing super special. Looking at their yelp reviews, they've got some cooler drinks (rookie mistake on my part to not look at yelp reviews before coming), so maybe I'll try something a bit more innovative next time."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-04-19,5.0,"I am in NYC pretty often for work, usually at least 1 week per month, so I get to indulge in all of the good food that NYC has to offer.  B&B was introduced to me by a coworker that lives in Manhattan.  I will go out of my way (like 10 blocks out of my way) to go here just for a coffee.  I have tried basically every coffee drink on the menu and I have not been let down once.  The only negative is the size of the shop, but it is NYC, nothing is big, except the prices (but this place is not expensive)!  They have a great seating area outside as well, so if you are lucky enough to grab a seat, grab it and enjoy watching the city go by.  This is definitely a place to check out though, but make sure you allow yourself a little time, good coffee doesn't just get thrown at you (like at Starbucks, yuck!)."

My fiancé and I popped in here and were blown away at the options; will definitely have to come back to try the food. They have the basics when it comes to coffee drinks if you're in the mood for something simple but I recommend the drinks that you probably won't find in other cafes. 

Of their signature drinks, we tried the:
The starling, which was a carbonated and cold-brewed hojicha. The flavor actually was quite strong and, while I wouldn't automatically assume that hojicha would taste that good carbonated, it was delicious. 

The sparrow, which was espresso, lemon, and carbonated water. Again, I didn't think espresso and lemon would pair together but it was an interesting taste that grows on your tongue. 

The owners were behind the counter making the drinks. When I was poring over the menu, the owner offered a small sample of the starling for me to try. Very thoughtful! 

Nice, soothing decor (including a mural of preserved plants that the owner made herself). Definitely want to come again."

942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-04-02,5.0,"One of my favorite cafes in New York! The owners are extremely knowledgeable but still very approachable if you have any questions about the menu (or about how they started this cafe). The cafe itself is small but has a cute outdoor seating area and if you are able to snag a seat inside the ambiance is very cozy and tranquil. 

In terms of drinks, I've ordered the iced matcha latte, the blackbird, and the nightingale. Their specialty drinks (named after different birds) including their seasonal ones are sometimes hit or miss depending on your palette and tolerance for experimental flavors, but I've liked every one that I've tried so far.

In terms of food, I'm blown away every time. I've tried kouign-amann, fig & cheese danish, and yuzu ricotta toast and the flavors of each have been absolutely wonderful. Very rich and well-made with portion sizes that are surprisingly generous for New York prices."
942,bird-and-branch-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"My favorite coffee shop in the city because of their creative drinks and baked goods! I'm obsessed with their ""nut milk"" drinks and matcha squares.

Also to that strange dude ranting about e-mailed receipts...are you from the past? Did you travel to the future to complain about digital receipts? because Square registers and non-printed receipts are literally e.v.e.r.y.w.h.e.r.e in NYC. CVS is the only place i expect to get paper receipts"
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2020-05-17,4.0,"I have not been to any of Wattle Cafe's locations in person (yet) but I have ordered brunchy stuff from this location a few times and really enjoyed it.

As far as savory stuff goes, the eggs are delicious (and cage-free), and although I am not a huge bacon fan, my boyfriend says the bacon is amazing.

For sweeter stuff, we loved the ricotta pancakes. They are right up there with some of my other favorite (and pricier) go-to ricotta pancakes from Bluestone Lane and from Forager's Table in Chelsea. The waffles are pretty exceptional, with a distinct homemade taste. Most recently I  broke down and ordered the weird/popular cacao waffle avocado smash, just to see what it was like--- in short, very different. I definitely enjoyed it, but I think next time I will get the cacao waffle on its own because it's fantastic (rich and earthy, not sweet) and doesn't need avocado mush killing its vibe.

Regarding drinks, the matcha magic smoothie is REALLY good, with a strong matcha flavor and not too much sweetness. (I liked that they left the date bits a little chunky, which gives you a little random jolt of sweet every couple of sips.)

Also, they seem to consistently use paper packaging for delivery, which is always good for brownie points in my book!"
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2020-02-07,5.0,"What a cute little place !! I've walked by a bunch of times but never stopped in, as I thought the name was ""WaFFle Cafe"" and don't particularly love or seek out waffles. (It's waTTle Cafe - a wattle is a native Australian tree- but yes do they have waffles here). 

Decided to stop by randomly for lunch and ordered two different chicken sandwiches they have here - the avocado chicken and cayenne free range chicken. Both sandwiches were super fresh and really delicious. 

Really happy we decided to stop in bc this place will definitely be a go-to breakfast or lunch spot for us going forward !! Definitely check it out! I've cOme for lunch every day bc their food is addictively good"

We have four hungry teenagers and two adults who want to eat clean and healthy. All were super happy! The food is delicious. The hot foods were delivered hot and the cold, cold. Their chia pots are a delicious, unconventional snack/dessert (or meal if you choose). 
Eggs were done perfectly, bacon was crisp but not burned, and the waffles light and fluffy. 
Also included an açaí bowl- it was delish! 
Their food offerings are a good variety and everything tastes fresh. It is difficult to please four teenagers and you hit it out of the park!! We are definitely returning!"
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-10-21,4.0,"Wattle cafe is hidden among the flashy sports bars and boozy brunch spots on Third Ave. Here you'll find a warm vibe and delicious, wholesome brunch options.

The menu highlights are varieties of avo toast/sandwich/smashes, smoothies, and waffles. Everything looks beautiful and the ingredients are high quality. The price reflects it, but it's worth it for the taste. 

For food, we tried the avocado with free range chicken sandwich, cheddar chive biscuit with egg (+ salmon). The sandwich was a great mix of pesto, juicy chicken, avocado, all on a great multigrain bread. The biscuit sandwich was also wonderful - I loved the cheese and peppers in the biscuit, which went well with the egg. I usually don't add salmon to my meals, but here it was a great complement. They don't have hot sauce in the front, but you can ask for some! 

For drinks, we had a flat white with oat milk, Yellow Dream and Anti-inflammatory smoothies. The Anti-inflammatory smoothie is their most popular and has a nice creamy texture but isn't too sweet. The Yellow Dream was a miss, unfortunately. Very watery, the consistency of juice, with an odd mix of flavors. There were also brown chunks inside the smoothie that looked like dates? Not good. 

Overall, a great, fast, delicious brunch place. I'll be back for the food and coffee, but probably not the smoothies."

Didn't even take a pic of my matcha latte cause they didn't even try with the art, it was messy by the time it got to me and the matcha powder wasn't mixed well so the drink wasn't smooth at all (think I had fair tries of drinks here). As for the foods, my egg wrap with cheese and lettuce tomato wasn't bad. My husband got a bacon with avacado sandwich, I liked it better than my wrap. My friends got the chicken sandwich and avacado toast with smoke salmon that they claimed not bad so overall food is probably better than drinks here"
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-12-18,4.0,"Waffle Cafe was a nice find in Midtown.
With an Australian vibe, you can get a nice breakfast and drinks for affordable prices. 

I had a breakfast roll with oat cappuccino. Everything was fresh and delicious. 
From the people at the location I can see it is a local spot and many of them seem to go there regularly. 

I would come back if around that area."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2020-03-09,1.0,Mocha tasted like chocolate water and the wrap had no eggs and was dripping with liquid incredibly hard to eat and no flavor at all. Do not go here!!
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2020-04-15,5.0,Ordered down under with Keto Waffle and it's the bomb. My daughter ate all her Keto with wild smoked salmon plus spinach GF waffle. That's our favorite this week! My husband got the BLT- Grassfed bacon. We tried Macanut last week and My husband is not a fan of anything dates I make but he liked this macanut a lot that he ended up finishing the balls. Amaze balls. Feels so good even after you eat it all and feel full. Good full. Satisfying my cravings but still healthy eating in times of corona anxiety period. Ordering again and again!
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-07-10,3.0,"After an all nighter this was exactly what I needed. Some eggs, bread and tea. 
The place is very cozy, too small for a large party and it doesn't have restrooms. The food was served pretty quickly and it tasted good (nothing remarkable). Prices were okay for the city but I got the feeling that is more like a grab to go kind of place."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-10-24,4.0,"Wattle is an awesome little spot for an artisanal and quiet/cozy brunch in Murray Hill.  Choose from tastefully prepared and Australian-influenced omelets, fresh waffles, and more, but be ready to drop close to $50 for breakfast for two once you factor in a round of espresso-based drinks.  Also, with total seating for around 10, arrive early and try to pay it forward by not lingering too much.  Don't be like the occasional randoms who commandeer the communal table by themselves and sprawl out with all the electronics..."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-11-20,3.0,"A small and quaint cafe with decent coffee. No complaints here. I haven't tried anything else besides their coffee so nothing else to base it on. 

I'm happy that there's a spot for coffee among all the bars and restaurants in the area though.

Overall, there are good vibes and a nice aesthetic."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2020-02-06,4.0,"I ordered the açaí bowl on yelp and the whole  process was seamless! The açaí bowl itself was so refreshing, with just the right amount of ingredients. It's nice to have healthy breakfast options around the area that opens before 8am!"
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-08-23,5.0,My new favorite breakfast spot. I definitely get the avocado smash with eggs 1-2x a week. I'm obsessed. I don't know how they make their eggs but it's so good and I'm not usually a scrambled eggs type of person.
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2020-02-10,5.0,Delicious  and nutritious.  Cute little cafe with a lot to offer.  Staff are pleasant and helpful.
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-12-17,3.0,This place is just okay...  not recommended unless you're stuck in the rain... I had high expectations from other Yelpers' reviews..
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2020-03-29,5.0,"Thank you Wattle cafe for yesterday's brunch we got delivered. Delicious and wholesome! 

Thank you for staying open and staying strong!"
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2018-12-16,3.0,"The cafe is small but has nice seating areas. I was here with a friend for Sunday brunch. The tables were full at the time we arrived so we sat at the counter at first, but it opened up fairly quickly so we were able to relocate.

The waffle is okay but not the greatest. It was somewhat dry and not as crispy as what I prefer. I actually like the waffles at Fairway cafe better. On the other hand, I really liked that the latte came in a big mug and I didn't have to worry about running out at all.

Like other similar cafes, it didn't seem like the restroom was available to the public. I wonder if the store offer customers to use the restroom if they ask. Anyways, that's another point off. There aren't enough spot that offers restroom in the city though, seriously. I think any locations with a solid eating area should have the bathroom available...

Even with such issues, I would want to come back to the cafe, try different dishes and enjoy the huge cup of latte again."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-12-09,5.0,"This place was a great, random find. I had the spinach salad with strawberries and a cheese & chives biscuit. 
The salad was delicious - all ingredients were fresh and melded together so well. The citrusy oil-based dressing complemented everything. 
As for the biscuit: cheese, chives and baked dough. Nuff said."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-04-04,4.0,"This new kid on the block is so worth a visit! The Aussie touch is endearing (minus the Vegemite jar, I kid, I kid), and the service was sweet and patient when I couldn't decide what I wanted from their loads of options. I came for a weekday brunch and got the smoked salmon avocado smash and a brewed coffee. The portion was just right and it was so wholesome and delicious. There's no free refills on the coffee and I'm not sure if they had a bathroom, FYI. They did have honey to mix in with the coffee, and it's great coffee. I definitely want to return to try their latte selections - I'm such a sucker for those weird flavors. 

The place is small, but they've added as much seating as they could. There's small and long tables, plus window seating. May be tough to get chairs on a weekend. Regardless, worth a try! Their food is a solid four stars and you won't leave hungry."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-05-12,3.0,"I would give it an overall rating of 3.5 stars. 
The food tastes not bad but too salty to my taste.
I feel for the avocado smash, they could have used garlic powder or onion power or some other herbs to enhance the favors instead of just adding more salt (which might be in response to some reviews complaining about their food being bland). 
I was impressive that the avocado smash held up really well in the delivery box though. And I like the soft and chewy waffle texture. The wrap is also a little salty and saggy, but the overall flavor of the wrap is more balanced than the cacao waffle with avocado smash dish. I hope they will have low sodium options in the future. I usually don't eat much salt (hypertension and stroke run in the family) so my body feels a bit uncomfortable after eating this much salt in one meal."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-03-23,5.0,"This cafe is so cute! It's also a great place to do your work while enjoying great food. I tried the Chive biscuit, which I enjoyed very much. I also tried my friend's avocado smash, which was delicious as well. I definitely want to come back here and try other options on the menu. Highly recommend!"
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-01-29,5.0,"Really good! We had gotten the salmon, avocado eggs and toast. I had also gotten their cappuccino which had a few little hearts made out of the foam which was super cute. Everything was delicious overall and I would go back there daily if I could!! Their staff is also super friendly and helpful!! Great experience thank you Wattle Cafe!"
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2020-04-04,5.0,Updating my review to help support my favorite go-to breakfast spot during these difficult times.
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-03-11,3.0,"Customer service is good-personable and fast. The food was just ok. I got the Yellow Day smoothie without the bee's pollen. Was a little bland- apple was the flavor that came out the most, weird being that pineapple is a stronger flavored fruit. The Matcha waffles were not sweet at all, so I doused them in the Woodlands Pure Maple syrup they had on the side counter. They weren't as green or as matcha-like as the pictures on Yelp indicated. Clean, peaceful and nice looking space."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2018-12-15,4.0,You will be waddling in here more often after you try their latte and food menu.  The latte taste superb and the Chive Cheddar Biscuit will open up your eyes on the first bite.  The eggs are cooked to perfection with just the right amount of salt.  The price is reasonable and the facilities are clean.  It's a must try if you are in the neighborhood.
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-02-10,2.0,"Both me and my bf ordered the bacon waffle because it sounded really good but it was nothing close to what we expected. We both didn't like the food, the waffle was bland and had no taste but the bacon was way too salty, and the hot chocolate was the worst of all! How can someone mess up on making hot coco? It tasted nothing like hot coco and it wasn't sweet at all. Terrible experience, wouldn't not come back."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2020-02-07,4.0,Nice spot for a fast but not fast food breakfast stop. Had the cheddar biscuit with eggs and my wife had the avocado toast.  Both were excellent!  Service was cheerful and decor bright and clean.  Beware that its a small place with only 1 large table and a few 2-tops plus a street facing counter.
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-01-07,3.0,"*3.5/5 STARS*

A very cute cafe just across the street from my boyfriend's sister's apartment! We visited New York over the holidays and enjoyed coming to Wattle in the morning for a cup of coffee. My go-to is the cortado (practically my go-to everywhere I go, if they offer it of course), so I highly recommend getting it, as Wattle's cortado was pretty good. 

We were able to try some of their food items as well, such as the breakfast burrito and pesto chicken sandwich! The breakfast burrito was just okay.... kind of bland in my opinion, I would skip this. The pesto chicken sandwich was quite tasty, although the chicken was quite dry. Try it with their sprouted grain bread, really yummy.

I don't think their food is as good as they're charging it for. It's quite expensive in my opinion... I don't think we would have came here regularly if it wasn't so conveniently close to the apartment. Highly recommend just coming here for a quick coffee but in terms of getting a meal, I'd go somewhere else!"
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-02-06,3.0,"The setting is loud and lively. The seating is comfortable and the restaurant has a relaxing atmosphere overall. Service was efficient and polite.
 
I had the matcha waffle and it wasn't bad, but I didn't love it. For the prices here, I probably wouldn't recommend this place."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-08-23,4.0,"Another of my go to MealPal salads!! It's fresh, the Swiss cheese is a nice touch!! The dressing is one of my favorites. My only suggestion is to add another dressing as the 2 are not enough in my opinion. I think I'll come in and try another one of their options."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-06-27,2.0,"Extremely slow services even when place seemed relatively empty.  

Avocado toast was ok for a price of $13 .. made up of what seemed to be sliced bread, not well toasted so tasted soggy"
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2020-01-13,5.0,This was a quick delicious spot for breakfast with my son this weekend: he had a plain waffle and I had scrambled eggs and toast. The side of lettuce and tomato was delicious! Very friendly staff. We were both happy with the choice in a city which so many places to choose from!
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-02-11,5.0,"Great food. Came here with fam and enjoyed everything on the menu. 
I orders tuna salad with one of their signature smoothie. I think it was little pricey but the freshness of the food made up for it. 
I definitely recommend it."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2018-11-02,5.0,"Take the cuteness of the shop, the gluten-free waffles made on a separate waffle iron that are fluffy, crispy, and delicious... and the convenient location in an area where there's not many healthy finds, and then add in the adorable quirkiness of this Australian establishment, the super friendly service, and the amazing wealth of health knowledge from the owner - and voila!  

The concoction for a PERFECT little spot on the East side.

The open face salmon avocado toast (on GF bread) is also delicious.

So are the cappuccinos. 

Hungry cat much approves - I heart this place, will be back."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-06-11,3.0,"I believe they specialize in making waffles but I think their waffles were dry and hard. The texture was very weird. The taste was good but the problem was really the texture. 
For the drink, I like their matcha latte. 

Also, I like their staff. The guy who works as a cashier is so nice, polite and attentive. It's not full-service restaurant, but the guy who works there served my foods at the table, took the plates off the table for me and immediately clean the table when guests left."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2018-11-17,4.0,"Scrumptious avocado smash toast with truffle eggs!

Went here to grab a quick bite and catch up with friend from out of town: perfect adorable place to do so! 
Food: we both got the avocado smash with lox on toast and truffle eggs. Avocado smash was so fresh and creamy and perfect to complement the brine bite of the lox :) scrambled eggs were fluffy and full of truffle flavor! 
Drinks: matcha latte- not too sweet but with just the right amount of sweetness. 
Space: cute ambiance with marble tables and counter tops and eclectic coffee shop artwork, succulents, and tidbits making it homey. Acoustics good to chat with friend and no need to shout to be heard or feel like you are disturbing other patrons. 
Service: quick, professional, friendly.
Price: $16 for avocado smash with lox and truffle eggs- not too bad considering quality of ingredients and amount given. $6 matcha latte- on par with other places here in nyc. 

Overall would come back to try other items on the menu or to just enjoy and sip another matcha latte!"
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-03-26,5.0,Had an exquisite brunch at Wattle Cafe. The avocado was extraordinarily fresh and the smoked salmon was pristine. I would definitely recommend visiting if you love avocados and smoked salmon. The meal is cooked to perfection and the staff is very nice.
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2019-02-12,2.0,"I love how this cafe is set up and the decorations! Great location! The staff is very friendly and pleasant! But here's why it's getting the 2 stars:

I bought the Aussie Waffles to go (Waffles with Bacon and Eggs) and it wasn't great:

1. The waffles was super bland. 

2. The syrup it came with wasn't as thick as any other syrup. In fact it was a bit watery. 

3. Some of the waffle/breakfast places usually gives you butter with waffles along with the syrup. This doesn't come with butter at all. I don't know if they forgot to add the butter or they just don't add it at all. 

4. The bacon was a bit too salty. 

5. The eggs wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best. 

6. The sad part about this is that all of this was $11 something. There's other places (even at lower income neighborhoods) that have better tasting waffles, bacon and eggs for half the price. I feel that this was overpriced.

Nice staff and atmosphere. The food, not so much."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2020-03-08,1.0,"Overhyped place, nothing special about the food and I can easily make this at home. We ordered Frutopia and avocado smash  for dine-in. We were served food in hideous disposable bowls. Food tasted okay nothing great. I will not recommend this place to anyone."
943,wattle-cafe-new-york,2018-10-27,5.0,"At wattle again for lunch.  I can't describe how much I love this place. Sadly fletcher is gone. But Tom is is Australian replacement.  

Today we had the charcoal ricotta pancake, Tuna sandwich, chicken avocado sandwich, and an egg (for my daughter)

The tuna salad is OUTSTANDING. In a crunchy whole grain bread. The chicken avocado sandwich is also excellent. Pesto on the bread. Perfectly cooked chicken  

I order the pancake because it settles my stomach. It is a very light flavor and needs to be dunked in maple syrup. 

Good coffee good food. Come here!"
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2020-03-08,4.0,"We happened upon this place after a long day of walking. We were especially happy there was no wait for our party of four. Our server, Nora, was a shining star. Her knowledge of the menu and offerings helped us decide upon a large pizza (half vegetarian, half prosciutto) and two salads and washed it down with a decent chianti. All bottles of wine are $32, making it an easy decision for a party of four ladies. Nora was attentive and the food was delicious. I particularly enjoyed the prosciutto pizza with arugula and fig reduction. The crust was perfectly crispy/chewy, cheese gooey and there was an excellent balance of flavor profiles with the savory meat, peppery arugula and the slightly sweet & acidic reduction. For quality, service and affordability, this place is fantastic."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-12-28,1.0,"Ordered Uncle Paul's pizza for pickup and arrived to find that they had missed two of our pizzas and would need another 20 minutes to finish the order. Although we were okay with the wait (walked 15 min to get there), we received no discount for our wasted time and were told by a manager at the register that they would not discount it any way. Once the pizza order was ""ready"", we noticed that one of our 10"" pizzas was a large and charged as a large. When we asked to be charged for the 10"" as ordered, we were told that they would need to make a 10"" and it would take an additional 15-20 minutes. The same manager made zero effort to correct the order, told us that we were being ridiculous for asking, and that we could have the already made pizza for full charge or remove the entire pizza from the order (she was going back to just throw it out). I'm disappointed by the lack of customer service by this manager and will never be a returning customer. 

On a positive note, I want to give a shout out to the employees who apologized for the mistakes with the order. Thank you for trying to help us out even though your manager didn't care."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2020-01-30,4.0,Best Lasagna pizza i have had.  Regular slice is not as good.  Ask to get the lasagna very hot.   There are usually seeats available so you need not take it back to your office and have a cold or lukewarm slice.  The chicken parmigiana hereo is also excellent    Great value and large.
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-11-25,5.0,Stopped in for a quick bite for lunch.  They get pretty busy around lunch time and there inside is a little small. There is a good selection of specialty slices and entrees.  I decided to so with the standard plain slice and a grandma.  The guy working the oven were very pleasant and they were joking with each other and it added to the character of the place. The pizza was very good and the prices are reasonable for Manhattan.
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-11-30,4.0,"Friendly staff 
 Cozy place, very authentic NY style place 
 The pies were delicious, crispy but not burned, the cheese was tasty, even the dough was delicious 
 Bathroom was clean 
They didn't have Peroni
 Only one server and the place was packed"
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-12-17,5.0,"Yes, I was intoxicated when I stumbled upon Uncle Paul's with my coworkers. In my defense, I know a solid slice of pizza when I take a bite (sober or not). I chose the pizza that I thought was the most visually pleasing and the one on the bottom of my picture was the winner. I took a bite and I thought it was HEAVENLY! The bottom crust had a nice crisp to it, although it was toasted a little too much. However, if you're a New Yorker, take this review with a grain of salt. I'm from the West Coast so I'm only writing this with very little experience in East Coast pizza, but I'm writing this in good faith that my taste buds know what they're talking about LOL!"
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-04-20,4.0,"First time ever having a spicy chicken slice! I absolutely loved it. Not too spicy but still gives you a little kick. Crust was perfect - crispy at the end.

Quick slice spot in midtown Manhattan that has seating as well.

Definitely check out this spot and try this slice!"
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-07-21,3.0,"Decent slices to go... I've been here for a slice but never to sit down and have a proper meal. The pizzas we've tried have actually been pretty tasty. I guess it's not consistent according to the reviews I read. Everyone has their bad days. 
Service is a lil slow, some employees are nicer than others... and I did not like their cheesecakes."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2020-01-19,4.0,"This little hole in the wall was a place recommended to us a by a friend. It's pretty small inside and when we first walked in no employee greeted us or told us where to sit or where to order. We ended up getting a table from a couple who was leaving and then we figured out we order at the counter and pay there. All the pizzas are already made then heated up in their oven after you choose what slice you want. We got 3 big slices for about $18. Kind of pricey but they were good and hot when they bring it to you. The vegetable one was way better than I thought and the pepperoni was traditional and greasy. 
Not a bad spot and would consider coming back."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-08-21,5.0,"Best pizza I've tried in NYC! Many varieties & very authentic pizza. Cozy atmosphere!
Large pizza is great value too!! The Lasagna pizza was delicious!!"
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2018-07-15,3.0,"My coworker used to work here in NYC. She was craving pizza as we were approaching the hotel. Now since we saw this spot just right around the block. We decided why not, right? So we walk to it.

I had the vegetarian pizza. Which looked really good, but that's as far as it really went. I felt as if the pizza was super bland. The pepper flakes, garlic powder or the parmesan couldn't even save it for some reason.

The service was pretty good though. We walked in, we were greeted right away. Asked if we can sit and our waiter said she'll bring us menus. We ordered right away, we even got some waters. 

Pizza wasnt that good. Two stars go to the food, an extra star for service. That makes 3.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!"
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2020-03-06,1.0,"Ordered pizzas and large Caesar salad for large meeting with our company CEO. Pizza arrived and no salad. Delivery person shrugged and walked away. I have been calling the pizzeria and no one will answer. Be very wary of ordering from Uncle Paul's.

I have to amend - delivery man returned with large Caesar salad. Thank you Uncle Paul's! Your pizza is delicious and I didn't want to find a replacement."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2020-02-22,5.0,"Great pizza spot. Open very late, amazing service, and delicious pizza. Great for late night spot to grab some pizza after being out late or being out all day."

944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2018-04-13,3.0,"When stuck at work on Saturday's not a lot of options for ordering lunch this is one of the few places available.
we always go for delivery, Last time I visited the restaurant I had some Garlic knots this after some drinking in the area decent garlic knots. 
On the pizza we tend to go with Regular cheese which is good. 
The large Cheese w Grilled chicken is not bad they cut up the chicken a bit much & spread it around I feel they don't add enough chicken this way but whatever I guess gets the job done, good sauce on the pizza makes it not bad.  
Another large w Sausage this was the better pie nice amount of sausage on the pizza good taste wise. 
Caesar salad for take out it's ahh really skimpy looking barely anything on it they should at least add more lettuce or something. 
Delivery takes about 45 minutes, u can call or order online."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2020-02-19,2.0,"Not sure if they just ripped me off because I was wearing professional clothes, but I walked in here ordering a regular slice and was charged nearly $6 a slice. Don't go here guys, this is completely unacceptable. To management--You guys aren't lucali...stop ripping tourists off."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-07-08,3.0,"Solid pizza joint. Seems abit on the pricy side but still enjoyed the slice. I have been here twice and one time it was a great the other was so so.

Got to NYC and said I have to have a slice , typed into the good old yelp and google for best pizza near me and bam this place came up . Walked in around lunch time with many people with same idea . Busy busy but moved down the line quickly . Once you get Up to the ordering section they have slices ranging from white sauces with veggies to red sauces . I believe I even saw one without cheese . Slices are about 4.25-4.75 which is little higher then a few places in the area but had a lot of toppings . Couple quick min later as you paid your slices came heated . They do have menus for other food but seems like people only came in for this . Everything tasted delicious and with the ability to have quick turn over I can see why this place got its stars. Also looks like a family runs this or prephaps  people with same nationality which felt kinda cool felt you walked into a true Italian joint :) centrally located this place has the right idea"

944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-12-31,5.0,Stumbled across this great pizza restaurant when staying in the area in New York. It has the best pizza I tried while in New York - even better than Popular choices in Brooklyn and Bleecker St.
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-03-01,1.0,"Avoid this place. Place isn't too far from our office, and while it's conveniently located, I'd MUCH rather walk over to Naples 45 for better pizza, ambiance, and most importantly....the service. 

What happened today is we placed an order for 3 pies at 10AM via Seamless. We got the confirmation & selected a pickup time of 11:30-11:45. All was good, until we receive a phone call an hour later indicating they just received the order and will have to push the pickup to 12:45. One, this definitely is not true - seamless confirmed their order was sent. Two, the person on the phone and most of the people behind the counter at this establishment have a history of being flat our rude and unprofessional (give them a call before lunch and see for yourself!!). They basically think by you giving them your business, they're doing you a favor. 

Lastly, we sucked it up and just gave them the benefit of the doubt. Went over to pickup our pizza at the new time requested. Show up, don't even get acknowledged in an empty store. After waiting we announced ourselves, and were told we'd have to wait and our pizzas weren't ready!!!! 

So we waited another 15-20 minutes in the store, ask for crushed peppers & some paper plates as we are paying (receive a mumbled response)....we pay take a bag of plates they gave us and leave. Show up to the office.....no crushed pepper and the pizza isn't cooked properly through. 

Please save yourself the hassle and lunch money - visit Naples, or even the 99cent slice spots all over the city before this dump."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-12-06,4.0,I enjoyed this place.  I had their goat cheese pizza was delicious.  My friend had meat lovers which was really good as well.  Would recommend this place if you are looking for good pizza.
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-12-15,5.0,"Lots of law enforcement and utility workers get their food to go from here. We absolutely loved this place. The salads are as good as the pizza and that's saying a lot. The salads are lightly dressed with vinegar and oil dressing and the pizza is perfectly charred. We really adored this place. Amazing food. Lots of locals,"
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2017-08-24,4.0,"My office orders pizza pies here time to time! Delivery is on time and quick as long as you order before lunch hours. 

I have tried the Regular Cheese Pie, Pepperoni Pie, Sausage and Onions Pie, Breakfast Pie, and White Pizza Pie. All were very decent pies. I really liked the flavors of the ingredients especially the Sausage and Onions. I just wish that the pizza was a bit more cheesy. I would avoid the Breakfast Pie, you will not see a sunnyside up egg, if you're expecting that. 

Overall, decent pizza for the area."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-07-02,1.0,Absolutely horrible.  Pizza was pure soggy mush.  Linguini nere con scampi was pastey and flavorless.  This place was suggested by the Roosevelt Hotel.  Chipotle or a local pizza place would have been infinitely better.  The fact they survive is proof that people have little taste in Italian food.
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-11-05,5.0,"a must have if you're in Manhattan, authentic pizza by the slice or as whole, desserts to die for. The ambiance just perfect for  New York pizzeria"
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-04-02,5.0,"We walked a long way to find this little gem.
You line up to put in order, only a few tables, very crowded.
The pizza was so good, beer was cold, guys behind the counter very friendly.
Short wait to get your order, definitely a place to eat."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-04-12,3.0,Pizza was good. A bit salty and a bit pricey for a midtown pizza place. I don't know why this place needs a waitress during lunch. I could have gotten food a lot faster myself without having my party needlessly pay a tip to walk 2 feet.
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-03-13,4.0,No frills good NYC pizza. Loved the Sicilian. Super fast. Quaint little place with good atmosphere.
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-09-17,5.0,"This place is legit!  If you want true Italian style, margarita pizza, it is spot on. The pasta dishes are fantastic as well. Nothing fancy in terms of atmosphere but damn good food. Even the gelato exceeded our expectations. We found this place by mistake but we will visit again the next time we're in NYC."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2018-12-23,4.0,"I stopped here as I was in the area and decided to give the white pizza and grandmas a try. Staff was friendly enough and kept the line moving, but it's really about the pizza. While it's not the best in NY, it is still fantastic pizza. The white pizza and grandma were my 2 favorites. It a small place so likely you're going to stand up eating it outside. Make no mistake though, it's still good, authentic NY pizza."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-06-24,3.0,"The grandma's slice is good. Buffalo chicken slice is okay not a big fan but we can't all be 5 tool players. Other good slices include their plain and caprese slices. Their most eccentric slice is lasagna slice. Have had just one time and it was okay. Would prefer to just eat a lasagna dish. Tough to replicate the flavor/texture of elite lasagna in a New York style slice.

Pasta dishes are pretty good and large portion. Buffalo wings were not worth having again and I haven't met many wings which I don't like. Chicken parm hero is your average run of the mill pizza restaurant hero nothing special but not bad if youre in the area and want a chicken parm hero."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-04-07,5.0,"Service was great, and the pizza is amazing. If you're Not sure what pizza to get just ask your server. Oh pizzas are amazing!!"
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2020-02-14,1.0,For a regular pie shaped into a heart it costs $60... are you joking? $60?! That's the same price as their caviar pizza! It doesn't cost that much extra to shape a pie into a heart when other places do it easily. That price is plain ridiculous.
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2019-03-12,4.0,"We got an order to go while staying at The Roosevelt Hotel. We ordered the cheese pizza and the rice balls. The pizza was great and the rice balls were flavorful and had great texture. 

I picked up the order from the store. It was small but really nice inside. The staff was friendly and attentive."
944,uncle-pauls-pizza-new-york,2017-05-23,4.0,"Caprese pizza and white cheese pizza!! Yum!! I got the Buffalo chicken but already took a bite foodies!!
 The cheese is awesome and my pizza is slightly spicy! The Buffalo chicken wings look divine! Salads, wine, and paninis and wraps!"

945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2020-03-01,5.0,"Matto is $2 for everything you buy, which at first seemed like such a joke in NYC, I walked past it, scoffing, every morning.  But it's no joke.  That $2.00 promise includes iced coffee, sandwiches, hot chocolate, large cookies, larger waters, and anything else the shop is offering.  And honestly?  For $2.00 in NYC I'd be happy to munch on a day old corpse, because it would be a steal.       
                
But Matto doesn't offer corpse so I've switched to coming every morning, before work, getting their large iced coffee (which completely beats places that charge twice as much, like Gregory's & Birch & the bane of coffee lover's existence, Starbucks), a muffin (I suggest blueberry but for $2.00, I'd be happy eating road-kill flavor), a giant water, a stuffed foccaccia (spinach is my fav).  That said, if you go wrong (and with their business model, they don't offer nearly as much as some of the nearby places but you'll also cut your morning spend in, at least, half), it's $2.00 down the drain.  

TLDR:  It's $2.00, people.  If you don't like it, you'll make yourself like it because it's $2.00, folks, and actually the food (though limited) is great."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-08-02,4.0,"Dummy me thinking that the Matto I spotted on West 40th street was the only one in the city, I only learn this when passing another one at 46th street, and then searching on Yelp turned up 13 more of them, are they selling franchise with no money down or something?  Their store has a logo sign that looks just like the zero Tarot card , the FOOL card, was I now being mocked too?

Matto is Crazy in Italian I guess that's what the owner was told when he came up with the $2 for everything idea.   And it is crazy when you think stores are paying 20, 30, and 50 thousand a month in midtown so how are you supposed to make any money?

Well time to try them, and they got your usual list of espresso coffee and then some I rarely see, a 'Red Eye'  which is espresso mix with  an other coffee  like drip and a Cortado which should be boiled milk and espresso and not foamy.   
My mother used to make it perfectly, I don't try to do it myself anymore because my milk would boil over and make a mess on the stove. And then the secret to not getting the milk skim on top 9f your coffee is to blow while your are poring the boiled milk in.

They have a decent number of muffins , cakes, cookies that are good for $2 and so was the coffee I had , but I do Starbucks Venti these days so I had to get another coffee after I got to the office because the coffee cups are small.

I must say I was impressed with Matto and $2 doesn't mean you get cheap and tasteless."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-11-19,5.0,"Can't be their prices.$2 for everything. Any coffee drink, pastries, the kombucha, it's all $2. The coffee is delicious. I haven't tried the pastries yet. The hot chocolate also looked good. I plan to get hot chocolate the next time I'm in Manhattan."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-05-06,5.0,"Matto Espresso is such a lovely little cafe across from work. I was mind blown by how everything only cost $2 each, coffee and pastries alike. I was so surprised that my total bill came out to be less than $6 lol.

I ordered a cafe latte and an almond croissant for breakfast. The latte was made to order, tasted great, but is smaller in size. I really liked the almond croissant after it was heated up. The entire pastry was sweet, flaky, and buttery with delicious sweet fillings on the inside. 

Overall, I was impressed with Matto Espresso! Definitely one of the top spots to grab cheap but quality coffee and breakfast in Midtown East."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-05-17,5.0,"Bottom line: $2 for every item. This is not a gimmick! And the food is actually good! 

Today I got the multigrain croissant with egg - they heated it up for me but the egg wasn't completely warm. I didn't mind because I was in a rush but if you want it to hot you may want to ask them to toast it for longer.

In the past I've ordered the spinach Bureka (think of a spinach pie essentially) and that was great too. I am not sure how they keep their prices at McDonald's levels but the service is amazing and I hope they never change their business model! Love Matto!! 

Note: $4 credit card minimum"
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-11-12,5.0,"I'm all for cheap and delicious eats and Matto fits the bill! $2 for everything including pastries and coffee. I had the chocolate chip cookie which was ginormous and filled with huge chocolate chunks and got a taste of the coffee cake. Both were delicious and my wallet was super happy. Not to mention, the service is super friendly. 

Pro tip: ask them to warm your pastry - makes it even more delicious on a cold day!"
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-11-07,5.0,"MATTO is BY-FAR my favorite grab-n-go place around. I usually just get their chai latte when one of my colleagues does a coffee run and had never visited the store myself. Every one at work has been raving about this place and the fact that everything is just $2 excluding tax. I finally decided to come check out this place myself. I asked for the Nutella shell after the amazing things my colleagues had to say about it. The guy directly put into into a bag, so make sure to mention you'd like it ""toasted"" if you would. He was then toasting it for me when I pulled out my card and I was told - minimum $4 for card. I then noticed the sign that says that. I was going to get another Nutella shell, when the owner walks up "", and says: ""Just get one if you need only one"". We then chatted for a few about the store and I mentioned how amazing my colleagues and I think this place is. Not only is it great value for money, but great tasting too. Absolutely delighted with the variety of items in this store and the hospitality. Most definitely going back, with cash. ;) :)"
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-11-19,4.0,"Cannot express how great this little business is. 
Coffees, juices, cakes sandwiches all 2$! (Without tax so roughly 2.17$ an item).
Coffee is good, I usually get iced with a syrup and tastes as good as any other establishment. 
Staff are friendly too. 
Only negative is sometimes there's a queue (rush hour)."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-09-18,5.0,"Prices are great. The almond cake, chocolate chip cookie and hot mocha are great. Line moves quickly :) Friendly service. $4 minimum on cards.

Will go again...anyone have any insight on the stuffed foccaccia with Mozzarella or Spinach Bureka? I would love to try!"
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-03-22,5.0,"I finally got a chance to come here and I am so happy I experienced this place. This morning I ordered a caramel latte with coconut milk and it was only $2. Can you believe they sell lattes for $2 in Manhattan!!! I could not believe this.

When I walked into this establishment I was greeted and immediately helped. I was told they offered several different non-dairy milk choices such as: almond, coconut, oat, and soy. You can get any of these milk choices for no additional cost. Which is wonderful when compared to other coffee/cafe shops. 

I also ordered a blueberry muffin that had some sort of crumb on top of it. It was delicious and moist but, I was disappointed that they could not heat up the muffin. It was a delicious muffin none the less. 

I will be back to try other options. This place will be one of my go-to places."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2018-10-01,4.0,"I previously wrote a review for Matto and gave it 2 stars. It's not that their food or service was terrible. To me, they just blend in with all the other coffee shops in NYC without leaving an impression. However, I do want to update my review. 

I still agree with my review that $2 for all items in the shop is very intriguing but it depends on the item you are purchasing. Drinks for $2 is a steal. A small half sandwich for $2 is not worth it. A small rice crispy treat for $2 is not worth it. And so on. 

What made me change my mind about Matto is because of two reasons:
1) Despite their small portions, their food and drinks are pretty tasty. I still love their chocolate chip cookie and they run out fast! I've been ordering their ice coffee and like all other coffee shops, it's pretty much average. Except, it's only $2 before tax. I really appreciate that they give a lot of choices for milk and sugar. Rather than giving the usual regular milk, sugar, and sugar syrup, Matto really encourages you to become creative. They have regular milk, skim milk, 2% milk, almond milk (in some locations only), soy milk, sugar, raw cane sugar, honey, agave, and so on. What's not to like about that?

2) Their staff service is amazing. Every time I come inside, the staff greets me with smiles. If I want a recommendation, they will really take into consideration my preferences. Although, not everyone gets my coffee order right. I always ask to fill the cup half way up with coffe so I could fill the rest with milk. They always put in too much and I have to tell them to pour some out. 

Overall, I think they deserve another star."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2017-10-31,5.0,"Review #700!  My biggest gripe about this place is not knowing they had other locations spread around Manhattan!  This is my first experience with Matto, having just recently opened up shop on 40th between Lex & Park.  We were drawn in by the ""EVERYTHING IS $2"" chalkboard so figured we'd venture in to explore what they could possibly be offering.  Famous Amos-sized cookies?  Bite-sized avocado toast sandwiches?  Three ounces of your favorite coffee?  Not at all!  

Matto serves up a selection of sandwiches, ranging from (our favorite) the veggie burger, to egg salad, to smoked salmon, and more.  The sandwiches are generous and ""thick,"" but half-size - they make for a perfect snack or small lunch if you're not starving for a full on deli hero.  For drinks, they offer any sized hot or iced coffee, along with espresso-based concoctions like cappuccinos and lattes, all for...yup, $2.  In fact, looking up and down the line, there's really nothing I could find that doesn't seem ""worth"" more than the price tag here.  Everything we've had has been good and doesn't feel at all like they cut corners to keep their prices low.   

Note that aside from a small counter ledge, there's really no place to eat inside, but there's a big expanse of steps across the street, and you're also just a few blocks from Bryant Park.  Also, for those interested, this place is not stroller or wheelchair friendly - you have to descend about 3-4 steps once you go inside."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2017-09-16,5.0,"Yes it true $2 per item   ( Actually $2.18 with taxes , get your loose change ready & click helpful (lol) )

Its really Close to Grand Central Station & Blink Grand Central.  When I 1st came across this place and I saw the sign said Everything was $2 , I did not believe it and asked their workers to confirm. 

 I told my co-workers how can they operate a Manhattan store front on $2 per item.   We tried the banana bread (decent) , Organic OJ ( okay taste ) , Ice tea (good size and good ) and croissant omelet sandwich.  I saw their Muffin and Cookie which I plan to try near future.

See my photos of their $2 drinks session - 1L Water at $2 is a hard fine in the City.  Their ice tea was delicious and organic.

I would rate their food on same scale as Starbucks.   To be honest the pastries and food I tried so far are 3.5 to 4 stars, but for $2.18 after taxes and friendly service and cleanliness, they deserve the 1.5 stars more. 

P.S. : They close early at 6pm and check if open on weekends ( I think they are closed on weekend)   Unfortunately they don't have a seating area."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2017-10-13,3.0,"I came on a Friday afternoon and nearly everything was gone! I decided to get the vegan donut. I'm pretty sure it's $2 each but the guy was kind enough to give me 2. But they turned out to be extremely dry, crumbly and old tasting.  It was way too sweet for me I couldn't finish one. I did see a vegan almond butter cookie that also looked good. 

Don't get the vegan donut! I will try other items next time."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-04-25,5.0,"This is the most important discovery of the century. Everything, I repeat, everything is $2. Their baked goods are big and delicious. Gluten free peanut caramel bar/pie is sooo good. And focaccia that looks beautiful and tastes great will be my new ""I forgot my lunch and have very little money"" go-to. Dollar pizza, nevermore. Also yummy chai latte."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-03-01,4.0,Amazing coffee and pastries for only $2. So excited to have this coffee shop close by. Excellent coffee and great service.

It's about a block away from my job and I love going there for my morning coffee and a sandwich, and for $4 in Midtown that's quite a steal. My only complaint is that they're closed on weekends and now that I only work weekends I'm devastated having to go next door to Starbucks and end up paying $8-$10 for something I could get at Matto for way less!

Their lattes are my favorite and I love that adding flavor doesn't cost more. Their espresso is pristine and tastes incredible every single time. I love the choices for skyrr or some fruit, or even juices in the fridge for something to grab real quick.

The staff is super friendly and service is fast and helpful!"

That's the great deal at Matto Espresso, Italian coffee bar with multiple locations in Manhattan. I went to their location on 40th street, near Grand Central.

I had a Cappuccino, which was good and some of their bakery. My favorite was the pistachio muffin, you need to try it!!"
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2020-01-06,5.0,I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Staff is supper friendly too!  I'm on a tight budget and this place fits me perfect.  Cappucciono $2!  Insane where in Midtown NYC you find these prices and good pastries!  I just bought their $20. card..excellent - everything $2. :)
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-07-06,5.0,I go out of my way to come here before work. To pay less that $5 for an iced latte AND a muffin? No brainer. They are also very quick and quite friendly!
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2018-09-26,5.0,"Stopped in, almost by accident. Very cute, and love the concept of the $2 everything. Now I have a new favorite little cafe to go to!"
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2018-02-12,5.0,"What a gem! This is a neat little bakery that sells everything for $2 which is very fair considering the competition. Everything from coffee, baked goods, and breakfast sandwiches (toasted!) are all $2 each. The place looks clean and the staff are friendly. I ordered an iced coffee, a multigrain omelette croissant sandwich, and a blueberry muffin. The coffee was great, and the ""medium"" is the size of a Starbucks grande. They asked if I wanted a medium or large, which was a little confusing - maybe they are the same price, but I didn't need me a large. The breakfast sandwich was yummy and I liked how they warmed it up for me. I didn't see any breakfast sandwich options with meat (probably to keep costs down), so it would be a great option for vegans or if you just don't need meat in every meal. The blueberry muffin tasted freshly baked, with a crispy muffin ""top"" and moist center. It was not too sweet either and had no sugar on top (I literally cringe when I see sugar-crusted muffins). Probably one of the best-tasting blueberry muffins I've ever had, I dare say. I was impressed with the quality of everything I ordered. I was half expecting it to be small sizes, watered down coffee,  and store bought muffins - not the case at all. I noticed they have some healthier options, like salmon bagel, avocado sandwich, organic quinoa, multigrain croissant, etc. 

This is my new go-to breakfast spot, much preferred over the pricier alternatives in the area (Starbucks, 2beans). And yes, I realize I had two breakfasts, but everything looked so good, I couldn't decide. Don't judge me."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-01-23,1.0,"Earl grey pastry was dry. But the service was subpar. When my coworker walked in to inquire a carrot cake to order. They barely acknowledge our presence. It felt they were a bit sexist servicing some minority women. Felt really uncomfortable in the circumstances. Severely disappointing.
I have been back. But this morning, the staff is confused as ever. The male staff seems to be always messing up my order. I said chocolate twist not chocolate cookie. The women staff when I am there never messes up my order."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2017-10-20,5.0,Awesome place!  I had a great iced latte and an egg croissant sandwich.

945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2018-08-30,4.0,"This is a Kosher bakery and coffee shop chain where everything is $2 (not including tax) near my work.  They have muffins, croissants, sandwiches (cut in half), pastries, and drinks (iced and hot Italian espresso).  The quality of the food and drink was high despite the cheap price of $2.  I ordered an ice coffee and a spinach boureka.  A boureka is a popular Israeli pastry that's made from puff pastry with various fillings inside.  I asked for it to be toasted and it was delicious.  It was fresh, full of spinach filling, and the puff pastry was flaky.  The ice coffee was refreshing and cold on a hot summer day.  There isn't any seating but the shop was packed with people even though I went after lunch.  The pistachio pastries and muffins looked good.  Some items are not a good deal like the cookies and the sandwiches (no meat, only half so pretty small).  I will definitely be back to try their other items.  FYI - there's a minimum $4 purchase to use credit card."

The first time I was there, I was kind of in disbelief that literally everything would be $2. An iced latte is like, $6 all around Midtown. But they aren't kidding. It's all $2. And it's all AMAZING.

I've tried so much of their menu, and everything I've had has been super tasty. The iced latte is perfect, and I've also been trying their sandwiches. The goat cheese sandwich and the tuna melt are my favorites. The tuna melt heated up is so, so, so good. I could eat it every single day. I also tried the acai juice, which was really tasty. My boyfriend is vegan, so I've gotten him a few of their different vegan treats, like the donut and the cookie. Both were amazing, and I really appreciate that they offer vegan baked goods!

Also, the people who work here are great! They're always really friendly and pleasant. I love coming here! There are so many things that I still need to try."

945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2017-12-06,3.0,"I heard so much about this place from my coworkers so I finally checked it out. Its a cute little coffee/baked goods shop with no seating. Their baked and refrigerated goods looked fresh but I only ordered a small coffee. 
While some of my coworkers like the coffee here, I did not like it at all. It was bland and it did not taste like it was freshly brewed. The Starbucks freshly brewed coffee tastes stronger and has more flavor than the one served here (and that says a lot)."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2017-11-29,5.0,"Awesome place to get a quick snack and cup of coffee! Literally everything is $2, and they serve La Colombe coffee. Service is always fast, friendly, and patient, and the location is perfect for on-the-go coffee runs."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-02-20,5.0,"If you want to find the best espresso in the city, stop looking and just pop into Zibetto. You can even practice your lingua italiana with some of the baristas which makes it a fun Italian experience. The apricot cookie is my favorite and I love the ambiance."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-10-28,5.0,"I'm gonna say it ... I think this is some of the best espresso I've ever had. 
I was looking up places that had great espresso in NYC and found a blog with a list of different spots. This one was in walking distance to my hotel (Even Hotels in Midtown East) although it was a bit of a hike. I ordered an iced cappuccino with almond milk. Normally, iced lattes or cappuccinos aren't that frothy, but not here. The froth was REAL and never went away. I loved that. The espresso was delicious as well. This place is teeny but charming. The staff are friendly. And my drink was incredible. I will be back.. counting down the minutes as we speak."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-10-30,5.0,"A month in Italy spoiled me rotten. You can't swing a cat without a decent half dozen espresso bars in Italy, yet it seems all but impossible to grab that cat by the tail here in the Big Apple.

Last night's post-dinner Starbucks was a disaster, and I tossed it after one sip. I'm glad I chanced upon Zibetto this morning. This was the real experience of all the espresso in Roma, Firenze, Tuscany, Cinque Terre, etc, but (sadly) all available at American prices. You won't find €1.10 cappuccinos here, but you *will* find cappuccinos that taste the same, and that's worth something. ;)"
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-12-23,5.0,Zib Zoom zoom. This awesome espresso spot is standing room only and the baristas are supper cool and whip up a strong tasteful espresso along with some delicious pastries. If you are in the area and need a quick boost this is a great spot
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-10-30,3.0,Cool place to grab a quick espresso to kick off your day.  The shop is narrow which adds to the charm of this little location.  Not much more to say as I've only had espresso here but I'd wager it's a dependable choice for something in and out.
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-07-10,4.0,"The pastries are good but pricey for the portion. L usually doesn't care for cannolis but this mini version was probably the best he's ever had. It was definitely better than the one he tried the other day from this old school pizzeria that's been around for over 70 years. 
I had the sfogliatelle which is the one that looks like a lobster tail. Very fancy looking, very flakey/crispy but I just didn't care for the orange peel flavor. 
Will try their coffee next time maybe when it's not so hot outside."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-10-07,5.0,"This is a cute little espresso bar nestled just a few blocks off of Central Park I found on Yelp! And when I say nestled, it's barely a 4-foot wide shotgun store with an adorable marble countertop wide enough to fit a cup of coffee and a phone for only a few patrons who want to stay and enjoy in-store. The interior is absolutely stunning. 

There's 3 things you must buy local if in NYC- a slice of pizza, a cup of coffee, and a bagel. Luckily I found one of three close to my hotel! For my early schedule, I needed a walkable place that was open at 7AM and served a mean iced coffee. The Zibetto version was strong and not burnt tasting with a bit of foam on top (how he interprets a little bit of almond milk). Didn't need a whole lot of stevia to add. It felt like I got a steal for $4 because of knowing NYC prices. If I had more time, I would've lingered longer."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-01-04,4.0,"In looking for the door to this place, I nearly walked into both the chopped salad place next door and the travel/luggage store on the other side but the end result was worth the minimal embarrassment. I'm not a big coffee drinker but I love a good Italian pastry or sandwich as much as the next person. 

I knew I had to come back once I saw the tub of Perugina chocolates sitting by the counter. If you've never had the pleasure of unwrapping one of these babies and savoring each bite, you honestly haven't lived. These make Hershey's taste like chalk. 

I usually go with a cappuccino + croissant, though, if you're in the area for lunch, do yourself a solid and grab the caprese panini. They'll toast it for you. Back to the pastries: Zibetto does an amazing chocolate cornetti (don't call it a croissant). I also love the tiny butter cookies that they serve with the coffee drinks. Planning on trying the cannoli and tiramisu next. 

Also, Starbucks has ruined all the traditional coffee drink names - like another reviewer pointed out, it's not a ""latte"" but a ""caffe latte."" I watched the barista gently point this out to someone: the two had a good laugh over whether or not the guy really did want a cup of steamed milk."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-11-06,5.0,"Beautiful crema. Does not break! Very well balanced. 
Zibetto knows how to do good espresso. Friendly and professional staff."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-12-25,5.0,"Zibetto reminds me of European coffee shops. It is a tiny space, but they serve a fantastic cup of whatever you order. You place your order with the barista and pay after you get your drink. Each drink gets freshly ground beans and perfectly made espresso. The menu is basic and straightforward. Try the marocchino! You can also order crossaints, bomboloni, cannolis, sandwiches or other pastries they have, and I don't know why, but even the crossaints tasted like ones I had in Italy. The prices are comparable to other coffee shops in the city, but this coffee shop is worth at least one visit if you want something simple yet good and want to support a small business."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-09-04,3.0,"Post biking adventure, this Zibetto location was right around the corner. The location was hidden among several other shops on the corner of the strip area, but once found, it was a cute little shop that offered a long bar where you could wait for your drink, but there was no seating. Basically a stop in, grab and go, coffee joint that fills your face with caffeine. 

The service was lacking, but the drinks were pretty great. I got an iced soy latte and it was exactly what I needed in the moment. The perfect balance of espresso to milk led me to drinking it quickly, but really enjoyed every moment I had with it. Seems like NYC has a plethora of coffee options, but for this being close to Central Park, it's worth a stop in for your coffee fix."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,"We've been stopping in for morning  coffee while touristing the city. Excellent coffee, people and atmosphere."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-12-29,3.0,"This was my first time trying the espresso at Zibetto. The service was excellent, as I don't need much attention. They were polite and helpful. I thought the cappuccino I ordered was just ok. I was eager to try it here because it seems they know a good espresso. My experience was that the espresso was fair. I enjoy a slightly richer, more full bodied flavor with no bitterness. This was not excessively bitter at all--it just lacked the smoothness I look for. The presentation was beautiful and I would recommend it as a solid place to grab an espresso one time.

Here are a few tips, though:
-As reported with the other readers, it's standing room only. It is quite cramped at this location but doable for a bit.
-The receipt gives an awkward tip option. You don't fill in your own or have an option to not tip. Honestly, I don't see much need to tip if my drink is simple and I'm not asking for anything additional. And I certainly don't need to pay 5.75 for a cappuccino that is already $5, nor do I want to feel guilty avoiding this.
-I recall that they used Denesi coffee, unless I'm mistaken.
-The espresso doesn't match the price point, in my opinion. However, everyone has their own palette. My friend loved it."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-03-11,5.0,I feel transported to Italy when I come to this place. It's small with no seating but you stand at the bar and have a perfectly made latte. My go to place when in town for a good coffee.
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-12-29,5.0,"My husband and I were visiting New York for Christmas and stumbled upon this beautiful coffee spot. We have managed to come here almost every day on our trip. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. Their cappuccinos are very tasty. Not too light and not too strong. Just right. The name speaks for itself ""espresso bar"". Yes, it isn't a very big place, hence why they call it an espresso bar. Take it and go or enjoy it there. I personally don't mind standing and enjoying my cappuccino/brioche/pastry. The cannoli is my favorite. It's one of the best cannolis I've had yet. The sandwiches are always fresh and tasty. Looking forward to coming back to New York for Zibetto's cappuccino. Till then Ciao!"
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-07-30,5.0,"Being from Waikiki, I know the importance of researching businesses in a tourist heavy town. I'm happy that this place, the one I chose, happened to also only be a block away from my hotel. Today was my second visit and from the quality, I will return for the remainder of my days in manhattan. I usually look for someone who respects their craft, which I found here. Bottom line, the coffee was fantastic!!"
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-04-16,4.0,Pretty good coffee. $6 for almond milk latte. The pastries were good. I asked for a plain crescent but got one filled with apricot. It was still yummy. The place is tiny and I don't know people hang out here bc it's tiny but they do.
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-05-15,5.0,"Small efficient Coffee shop.  I had the Macchiato.

946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-10-14,4.0,"This espresso bar is super cute and reminds me a lot of Italy. It is standing room only at the bar and they serve in actual cups if you are having it there. I had a cafe macchiato and it was very tasty. You can tell they craft the drinks with care. My husband had an affogato and it was an excellent treat. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the cost. It was a little pricey, but is worth paying for once in a while."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-06-10,3.0,"the smell of this place is always so inviting whenever I exit the subway station at 57st Street especially on those Monday morning when you really just need to take a sip of the human elixir of life (read: coffee - i always drink plain americano) to return from those weekend and go back to work. there is always a line, although thankfully not too long. actually the coffee is not bad, but I don't know, it's not really my taste and thus I don't go here often. in fact i usually end up getting my coffee somewhere else where the price is cheaper and it give me the same kick start of the day. sorry :(:( if you're looking for proper coffee and can't stand franchise coffee you might want to go here, but personally i take the cheaper coffee since i just need to wake up. the server doesn't smile all that much but don't let that upset you he's actually professional and nice"
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2017-11-29,4.0,"Sometimes, the office Keurig machine will just not cut it and I need a real espresso.  

One of my go to spots is Zibetto.  I like this place a lot because it is not drab, I'm serious about my coffee and free wifi while I write my book type of place.  It reminds me of an actual coffee / espresso shop in Italy.  There is a long white marble bar that you stand along and sip your espresso and there is dance / electro music playing on the stereo.  It is bright and full of light.  I love it.  If you don't feel like standing, they have some seating, too.

This location happens to be particularly spacious and is always buzzing with activity in the afternoon.  That said, they take your order quickly and before you know it you have your drink."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2017-12-31,5.0,"Made me feel like I was in Florence, most of the menu is in Italian too! It was around noon on New Years Eve, 15 degrees outside and a packed cafe with people enjoying their espresso. The barista was the kid of the family who runs it, enthusiastic, helpful, and really enjoyed his work. 

Ordered a Marocchino (shot of espresso with coco powder and frothy milk) and a Capaccino both were really good. Nice, strong coffee beans, good service, what else do you need?!"
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2017-10-27,5.0,"Just an adorable little New York City Midtown Coffee stop. If you want something authentic, and delicious, this is your spot. About the size of my Shoe Closet, no chairs or tables just a bar so it's really meant to just stop in sippy or espresso  and be on your way. Very Italian . it's really neat how the barista/owner (I think), can really just keep track of his clients. Always knowing who's next in line, even though there is no line. The hustle and bustle of NYC is in here. Wall Street men in their suits powering down an espresso before work, a few tourists grabbing a quick breakfast, and the people on their Daily Grind meeting up in the neighborhood that they live in for a pick-me-up. The espresso is on point, the menu is simple and perfect, and the food is just right."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-06-13,5.0,"Sheik place to grab an espresso, really Italian vibe with only standing area, clean place with good coffee!"
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-12-26,4.0,"It's a very nice place with decent pastries and cookies also above average coffee but in a city like New York with some specialty coffee and great selections, Zibetto is just another coffee shop in the city."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-09-06,5.0,I felt like I was transported back to Florence!! What an adorable shop I discovered thanks to the concierge at the Parker Hotel during my quick business trip. I have a half-caff double shot almond milk cappuccino and it rivals the best I've ever had. Wish I had more time to try the delicious looking Europe style pastries - will be coming back tomorrow to ensure i do!
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-04-21,5.0,"This all 5 star goes straight to their coffee. Their coffee is the most tasty one in NY.
Are their service good? I don't know nothing special.
How's the atmosphere? Not so good. I think they can do better. Like playing good music. Or better interior design and chairs.etc? I don't know it's not my business.ha
It's bit expensive too.
...
So yes their coffee is great. That's it.
If someone open a cafe with their beans and machines,I'd go there,expecting better management."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2017-05-19,4.0,"Not too many authentically Italian espresso spots in America. Zibetto is about as authentic as you can get to a real Italian coffee shop. Nothing fancy about this place, other than the white marble espresso counter. Americans who are looking for a coffee might be put off by the concept here ... The space is narrow and tight and there are few places to sit. Italians tend to go to a place like this for a quick cup and some socializing in the morning/afternoon. Then, in the evening they will find a place to sit and drink coffee for longer periods.

If you expect Starbucks here ... You won't find it. The espresso is strong and the cups are tiny ... A little good espresso goes a long way. They have wonderfully fresh looking sandwiches and a small selection of no frills Italian pastry (mostly of the cookie variety).

They also hire workers from Italy, it seems which adds to the experience. However, Italian counter staff can be very clinical/matter of fact by nature ... Which is also typical of Rome. (Until you get to know them)

If you want an authentic Italian experience, have an espresso here. Maybe a capuccino for the Americans. The prices for the location are very reasonable. $10 sandwiches, $2-3 pastries and a double shot of espresso is around $5. Single shots $3.50.

Be prepared to stand elbow to elbow but in the Italian tradition, you may leave with new friends."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-05-16,5.0,"Saw another review that said ""Dreams of Italy"" and that is a great description of Zibetto.

Ordered a cappuccino to stay (FYI standing room only) and I felt like I was right back in Italy. It was a perfect start to my day before I strolled around central park. Thinking about this place makes me extremely happy, and yet very sad  as I do not live in New York. If I lived in NYC, I would definitely be a regular. 

Very friendly service as well."

They have no tables so you have to strictly stand up. But this is not a big problem for me. I've seen they have some sandwiches and pastries. I didn't try but it seems yummy. Enjoy!"
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-08-07,5.0,This place is a must stop. I had the caprese sandwich and latte. Wow! The bread they use is delish and the latte was so smooth. I will definitely be back.
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2017-07-10,3.0,"$8 for a cappuccino that's half the size of a tall Starbucks cup? I think not. Although the quality is slightly better than Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts, the prices for everything is completely outrageous. Not to mention, the place is extremely small and narrow. Very uncomfortable. Definitely not a good place to meet, study, or talk. Only good for a quick coffee or lunch run. I guess that's why ""Espresso Bar"" is in the name. Skip this place and just get Starbucks across the street or head to other nearby cafes that are just as good, if not, better."
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2015-04-30,4.0,"Gratzi!!! 

The coffee..wait..correction. The espresso here is melt you teeth strong. I had some this morning and I am still full of energy typing away yelp reviews like nobody's business. Obviously having issues focusing at the task at hand. Back to Zibetto, I came into this tiny spot this morning and I loved it. It has that European feel. The room is long and slim with no table or chairs just high counters that allow patrons to stand and have a latte and enjoy some nibbles. This is very traditional in European cafes. I was also mesmerized by the Italian treats that were offered from cannolis to cornetto (a ricotta filled pastry) along with almond cookies and hazelnut sandwich cookies. I also spotted a variety of sandwiches including a fave, tomato mozzarella. 

A great spot to grab a morning or afternoon pick me up before heading into Central Park!"
946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-06-26,5.0,"My husband and I got a cappuccino and a macchiato. Both were nice and strong and got us energized for a walk around Central Park.

946,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-05-23,5.0,I get coffee from here almost every day and I love it.  They owner and his staff are all super friendly and always remember my order which is nice in such a big city. Their coffee is so good and their espresso keeps me awake for the whole work day.
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-26,5.0,Amazing iced oat vanilla latte. Fantastic. Great service the egg avocado toast and the breakfast burrito are awesome as well!
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2020-06-11,5.0,Far and away the best coffee experience in the area. The owner and staff are delightful and the sugarless cherry scone is in my top five pastry experiences of all time.
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-08,5.0,"I walked to Pennylane Coffee before work to grab some coffee and pastry for breakfast directly across from the Westin. I was pleasantly surprised by the comfortable and cozy environment, and friendly staff.

I ordered a flat white and a sugarless cherry scone. I also confirmed with the staff that there's no sugar in the baked good. The flat white had a strong taste of coffee that's flavorful and rich. Scone, on the other hand, was delightful. Although it's sturdier than a typical biscuit, the scone was quite hearty and had a natural tartness coming from the added dried cherry bits.

Overall, I had to walk a bit further to this coffee shop, but I thought it was worth checking out!"
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-21,4.0,"Cute coffee shop! The espresso drinks are good and they have a loyalty card. It tends to get packed during peak lunch hours after 1 pm.

I asked for an espresso and I had one of the worst espressos I've ever tasted in my life. Not sure if they person behind the counter used toilet water to make this thing but it was a struggle to finish it."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-26,3.0,"I went to the no.2 location on 42nd st. This is a nice coffee shop with a minimalist menu. It has a good vibe and it's a great place to meet up for quick chats with people. They keep their bathroom clean and stocked, so it's welcoming. I went in at 12:00pm on Friday and it was not very crowded. Most people who ordered just quickly went back out to tend to their business, so the table and seats were empty. 

The food items are definitely overpriced for what it is and how little they give. Nonetheless, I understand it is in manhattan, so be it. The greek yogurt granola used dragon fruit flavor, so it was new and interesting. Taste was so-so and portion was very little for $9. The honey and the granola crunch was a good and needed addition. However, I believe I make better greek yogurt bowls. I tried to study here a bit as well, but this is not an ideal working space. 

I would come here occasionally, maybe for convenience sake, but not because it's a great place. Perhaps when I try other things on their menu my current rating on it will change."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-15,5.0,"The baristas here know how to make a killer macchiato, dry, with only foam. It came out perfect! Plus I love their salad selection for lunch time, and the cool, dark decor. It's so chill and relaxing. I love coming here for a break from the office. Everyone is friendly and really passionate about artisanal coffee, salads, and sandwiches."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2017-11-24,3.0,"Pennylane is a decent coffee shop tucked away in Midtown East. The space is nicely decorated, but the lighting is pretty dark and probably not conducive to working (also their music gets a little loud sometimes). 

Seems like they're sometimes overwhelmed and mess up orders - I had to repeat my soy add-on multiple times and my flat white turned into a cappuccino, but the coffee is good and so I guess I'll stick to a simple cup of drip coffee unless I'm the only person ordering. The food and dessert offerings are quite varied and good as well. 

Wished they opened later on weekends though - it seems like a nice place to sit and chill, but that's not really the target crowd for a coffee shop in Midtown."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-11,4.0,"Imagine a startup coffee shop and that's the vibe I got when I walked in. True to its stereotype, that iced oat latte ($5.45) was delicious. They weren't very busy other than maybe 4-5 customers sitting and discussing work. The ambiance caters to a work friendly environment. I'll bring my laptop next time!  +1 for offering non-plastic straws that are cute. I would give them a 4.75 if I could, because the only down side I saw was it looked a bit dark inside."

The barista working was very nice.   We ordered a cappuccino and a cold brew.   The cold brew was fine.   As a previous reviewer stated, the product did have a weird tartness that was off-putting.   As an overall product it was drinkable but not great.   The cappuccino was very weak tasting.  Gf chucked it in the bin after drinking half of it.   I probably wouldn't come back on the strength of those drinks."

The coffee is hella expensive and you get like a 4-6oz cup for $4.75.
I would also like to add that the owner is very serious about customer service. He explained the bean that they use--it is fruity, not nutty. He takes pride in his business and I appreciate that. He makes sure that his customers are happy."

947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-28,5.0,"An authentic taste of contemporary coffee culture in the heart of the corporate wasteland. One almost feels like a human again.

Pennylane consistently delivers a much needed dose of high quality, carefully made espresso in the face of the crowds and chaos of midtown in the early morning (or, really, any time). ALL coffee options I've tried are to be recommended. The service is EFFICIENT, friendly and competent; the interior a cool, contemporary alternative to the neighborhood's more traditional, unkempt options. And the food menu offers a refreshing take on some classic breakfast/lunch options.

Keep it up! A+"
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-23,4.0,There was quite a lot of people here midday but they did well with quick service. Ive tried a few of the pastries and the regular coffee as well as a cortado. The prices are a little more reasonable than other NYC independent coffee shops. Both the food and coffee were good. Unfortunately my coffee cup collapsed a bit after reheating my coffee later in the day. The location can be a little out of the way and was slightly hard to find but def worth a visit.
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-18,1.0,Worst customer service. Rude and no consideration. Completely ignore for 10 mins just because they are busy and under staff.
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-01,5.0,"Super chill vibe - it's a clean, simple space with an airy feel, great gentle but energizing music and delicious food and coffee! I really like the mix of super healthy bowls and salads with sandwiches with cheeses and lovely toppings. Easy to get something lighter or more filling that I'm in the mood for and the egg and avo sandwich is great. Welcoming and kind staff, fast and pleasant service. Yum!"
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-03-08,3.0,"I figure it's tough to create a cozy cafe in this part of the city, but I feel like there wasn't much good here anyway. My cappuccino was pretty good so I was happy with that, but my sandwich was super forgettable. I found it weird that there wasn't much character here either. The inside is like 60% counter? Not much for seating either."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2017-05-27,4.0,"Small coffee shop tucked away on the far side of second ave. Covered by construction currently, so very easy to miss. Interior isn't marked (took me a while inside the cafe to figure out what it was called) but otherwise, nice vibe, nice pastries, and all the cafe caffeine essentials. 

Not too much seating - a high top, a booth and a large shared table. However, it didn't seem like Pennylane got crazy crowded, so perhaps it's adequate. Very chill, minimalist vibe. Only annoyance is that you can only have wifi for an hour."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-07,5.0,"Great vibe and the nicest staff! I am always curious about the latte art and had some failed attempt at home, just randomly started a conversation with the barista and he started explaining the tricks and details and asked me to update him about my experiment. This place is where I want to grab my coffee."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-22,5.0,This is my favorite coffee shops in the area. On my breaks from work I love walking over here because they have the best lattes with a lot of non-dairy options and really good food selections. The customer service is always so friendly and welcoming.
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-06,4.0,"Two words - Stellar coffee. They lost a star for me only cos of the lack of seats and the almost non existent air conditioning; you could see sweat on the staffs' forehead, and the two tiny desk fans sitting on the floor only served to ventilate customers' shoes  Coffee was a tad pricy, but forgivable given the area it is in. They also had nice looking freshly baked cookies if you're a cookie person! Perfect for an hour's work or less maybe, but would not recommend if you intend to stay long."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-28,3.0,"The coffee is really good and the pastries look delicious.  The service is great too. However there's no air conditioning, and although Yelp says there's wifi, it's been broken both times I've been here, so I wouldn't rely on it."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-29,5.0,"Best coffee in the 'hood. It's expensive, but hey you're in Midtown East. Bonus points if you spot an ambassador to the UN. The food looks good but I haven't tried it."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-03,3.0,Solid coffee shop. Good tables to do work on. A little bit dark though. Good coffee!! Cute minimalist vibes. Eclectic music choices for a coffee shop.
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2017-12-30,5.0,"Really Cute coffee shop. They have a small selection of bakeries; croissants, banana nut bread, brownies, etc. the coffee is pretty good. Pretty designs in the coffee latte and good because it was strong and hot with perfect amount of milk. The croissants were warmed up and were nice and flaky indicating they were fresh. 
I plan to come back for my coffee dates."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-09,3.0,"Smaller space than I expected, making it hard to find some room to work or read with some good coffee (which is my favorite thing to do at a coffee shop!). The coffee itself was good - nothing special but definitely not bad!"
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2017-12-24,4.0,"I only visited once, so I don't have a ton to stay, but my initial thoughts were: Great vibe, great macchiato, caffeine, yum, will come back :)"
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2017-01-22,3.0,"Small, hipster coffee shop that also deals in alcohol in case you want a buzz with that caffeine. Coming from Pennsylvania, this was shocking as our liquor laws are archaic. Latte was good but nothing spectacular. The inside had a shelf that had a variety of books including some about brewing beer which I liked."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2016-07-07,4.0,"Accidentally walked pass the entrance of Pennylane multiple times before finally locating it correctly, I'm so happy I tried this out as Pennylane also serves Stumptown coffee, one of my favorite bean carriers. Ordered cappuccino, it was foamy, balanced, and had a slight touch of bitterness - well executed.

Pastries were freshly prepared daily and wrapped in paper bags carefully as well."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2017-11-08,4.0,"It's taken me so long to get to this review! My supervisor recommended that I try Pennylane Coffee, and so one day at lunch, I decided to go out and try it. I admit that it was a little difficult to find (I walked past it a couple of times before I noticed it), but once I got in, I found it to be quite a cute place! It's near the UN, so there are a lot UN staff members/delegates there during lunch, if that's your scene of choice. While I enjoy the ambiance and the their drinks, I don't think they're quite worth what you'd be paying; hence, 4 stars instead of 5."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2016-11-04,4.0,"I never would have thought to put Earl Grey and Hot Chocolate together, but I'm glad someone else did. It had a strong flavor but you could make the distinction between the two."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2017-08-29,2.0,"I love the coffee here and I like the space too, so normally I would give this place 4 or 5 stars.
But this morning I went there at 9am for a coffee, and they said, 'we're out of coffee'(!!!)

What kind of coffee shop doesn't have coffee at 9am?!!
Were they literally out of coffee?  Or did they forget to brew it??  
Who knows?!  No explanation given and no apologies offered. 
I had to move on."
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2017-06-07,5.0,Small shop with strong and tasty coffee. Very crowded in the morning but most are just dropping in to grab their daily fix. There was a large communal table and 2 other smaller tables the day I came in.
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2018-05-05,5.0,Awesome hidden gem in midtown. A step up from all the Starbucks in the area. High quality coffee and cold brew. Yummy snacks. Amazing service. Never a long line but always busy. A modern and artsy interior. Doesn't feel like you're in the industrious and commercial midtown. Highly recommend over the other coffee shops in the area.
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-09,5.0,"Came here with a few girl friends and got to try a bunch of things which surprisingly were all very delicious. We had the smashing avocado, fig & brie and the bacon egg sandwich. It was all so good it's hard to pick which was my favorite. The coffee was delicious as well. I had the latte with oat milk and it as the just right balance of rich, smooth and nuttiness (? - I think from the oat milk). Can't wait to go back, the only tough thing would be deciding which food to try next. :)"
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2017-05-04,5.0,"Great coffee shop. Got the espresso and free WiFi to work. Was able to write my daily blog for New York Computer Help without any distractions. Well, the only distractions were the constant line of people that came in and out. Busy place, very neighborhoody, and good selection of food. I'll be trying the avocodo toast next time or maybe the matcha bread. Very friendly and fast service. Recommended!"
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-04,4.0,"Pennylane has been a local favourite for many years with its proximity to the UN it will always be novel that you can sip a cappuccino and listen to foreign policy being discussed in 6 different languages at the same time. The decor is minimal with cool scandi touches everywhere with just about every seating option imaginable. The coffee program here is really solid, the team make sure they're on top of their bean game- sometimes even stocking my personal favourite Heart.coffee from Portland!
The wifi sitch can be a bit of a bummer but on the whole it's a really lovely little neighborhood spot!"
947,pennylane-coffee-new-york-2,2017-06-12,3.0,"A small space with decent coffee. I'm more of a tea drinker and I find this place lacks variety, especially with cold teas. They only have green tea or black tea if you want it iced. 

The space is cute, but half of it is so dimly lit that you'd probably fall asleep here. The other half luckily has natural light from the large glass windows. 

It's calm and quiet for the most part, so a good place to catch up with friends"
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2017-10-29,5.0,"Simon's sips' cafe latte is yumm! 
They have a big variety of cups sizes for hot coffees.
The staff is friendly, they were joking about not having a restroom in store. 
I was about to enter the black door, but they stopped me, saying ""that's a storage room and I don't want to get in there :) "" 
Yep,  no restrooms but that's pretty common for the coffee shops in this area, so that's alright. 

The coffee tastes good, the prices are okay, the staff is nice -so, 5 stars from me !"
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2019-04-13,2.0,"Came here with some friends for an afternoon coffee break. This place is a bit hard to find given that it's in the back of corporate building - so the entrance is actually on 46th Street between 6th and 7th Avenue. So it is good if you want to avoid the crowd and skip the line.

I got a medium Matcha Latte, which was, well, matcha powder and milk, and I tasted some not so well mixed powder while drinking my latte. Sad to say I didn't enjoy it at all, the heart on my Latte was also lopsided :(, but perhaps the other drinks might taste better. 

Also, spending 30 mins in the coffee shop left my hair and clothes with this greasy smell - maybe it's from the pastries in the baking. The place is not that big, and won't serve as a study place with nice windows.

So to sum it up, this place is good for no lines due to the hidden location; other coffee might taste better, and they have a reward card for you to accumulate a free drink; medium latte is like a tall/small size in Starbucks; greasy smell from sitting in the cafe too long; don't get the matcha latte."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2019-02-16,4.0,"Anything but Starbucks. Right? I was in the middle of Manhattan, so you can't blame me for wanting a bit of caffeine that wasn't as familiar and corporate to tickle my frostbitten tongue. It was chilly beyond belief as I was walking from lunch back to an office building on Sixth Avenue, but some coffee would allow me some comfort. Simon Says to turn into the brick-laden passageway between 46th and 45th just before Sixth and look up at the sign for Simon Sips. Simon Says to go inside the adjacent office building and walk left around a blind corner before the security turnstiles. And voila, Simon Says Simon Sips. Compact operation in here and friendly. The $3.40 medium Cafe au Lait hit the spot in spades (photo: http://bit.ly/2DWs8Oo). Simon Says go back to work.

COFFEE - 4 stars...a smooth brew with good strength on a mighty cold day
AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a bit of a hidden walk-in closet
SERVICE - 4 stars...Simon Says be nice
TOTAL - 4 stars...Simon Sips...but you didn't say Simon Says

948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2019-10-23,4.0,"Good little spot but man is it hard to find if you don't know where it is! Yelp must be good for a spot like this that isn't obvious on the street (although I'm sure they get a lot of business from the people in the building too). 

To enter you need to come into the courtyard off 46th or 47th a bit in from Ave of the Americas. It's in the back entrance of the big corporate building there and it's confusing because you do actually enter the building but hang a left before the turnstiles. 

They serve Hale and Hearty soups of which I had the vegetable. Standard fare. I had two hard boiled eggs which were nice and fresh, and my chai was made well. They have some seating if you want to eat there. 

The pastries looked great too but I was being healthy. I'd have loved to have one!"
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2019-10-02,3.0,"I understand it's an office building coffee place, but in a city where there is SO MUCH good coffee, this place should not be your go-to unless it is strictly a matter of convenience. 
Cappuccino was just a touch too hot; not scalded, but close. Music was too loud and not exactly calming (while I say there drinking an overpriced, below average capp, I heard Kid Rock, Black Eyed Peas, and Akon). It just wasn't the experience that I was hoping for. Again, when you have better options, take advantage of them."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2017-10-12,4.0,"Liked the mocha! 

They have all sizes of drinks from 4 to 16 oz and price very reasonable. Staffs were really nice explaining things. Also offered the point card (which is usually hidden and needed to be requested) which you get 7th drink free.

The place is hidden in an office building though. Can enter from the back of the building."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2017-08-17,4.0,"Updating my review~

I was invited to come try Simon Sips again after my previous experience. This time I was yet again met with such great people (awesome barista and cashier).

If you like sweeter matcha lattes like myself (but not too sweet), definitely consider getting a vanilla matcha latte with whole milk.

If you prefer unsweetened matcha drinks with a nuttier undertone, try the iced matcha latte with almond milk.

I really liked the fact that the location doesn't skimp out on the matcha. But as a result, be careful since the first few sips (hot) will be grainier (before the matcha has a chance to fully emulsify). After a few minutes it gets super creamy and smooth.

The iced drink is pretty smooth, with no graininess.

Thanks Simon!"
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2019-04-09,5.0,"Look out for an overhang connecting 46th and 47th, and underneath that overhang, there's a revolving door on the 6th Ave side. And behind that door is some of the best coffee in midtown--and light bites fit to eat. I almost don't want to leave a review because I don't want it to change. Not much sitting room, but except for two months out of the year, you'd do better to enjoy your delicious espresso right outside the entrance, where there's tons of outdoor space to sit or stand. Service with a smile, good music, good vibes. Thank you, Simon Sips."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2018-05-28,4.0,"This coffee shop was hard to find as it's on the ground floor inside an office building.
Great coffee - strong coffee flavor in my latte and it's relatively cheaper than most of the other coffee places.
Will definitely come back!"
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2018-10-11,4.0,"This spot is located in the lobby of an office building so it can be a bit hard to find. They serve coffee, baked goods and other snacks. It seems more of a to-go place as it's ver convenient. However, there are also some seats near the window if you wish to slowly *sip* your coffee or tea. 

Be sure to grab a punch card so that you can record your visits and get a free drink on your 8th drink I believe? The owner, Simon, is very nice and definitely appreciates his yelpers and other fellow customers!"
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2017-10-25,4.0,"Wifi, yes. Restroom, no. Outlets, no. Good coffee, yes. 

Hidden gem inside of an office building on the ground floor. Not visible bc of the turns required to get into the building. Walk down 46 st and there will be a sign between 7 and 6 ave. it's closer to 6 ave. there will be a sign. 

Small. Seats about 10, bar/ counter seating. Very friendly baristas. High volume of customers always- in and out, probably from the building. 

Mocha: 5/5. Perfect blend. Never had a mocha like this. Coconut chocolate cookie: v good. Had raisins, was not mentioned when inquired about cookie selections, great cookie otherwise."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2017-12-18,4.0,"True to the other reviews, Simon Sips is somewhat hidden away from the street, which makes it less busy than your average New York coffee shop on a week day morning. Perfect! 

There was a line, but it moved quickly. The baristas and cashier worked well together. I got a matcha latte and a bagel with cream cheese. The matcha latte was strong and came out fairly quickly. Simon Sips met all the criteria of a quick and delicious stop for breakfast."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2017-06-06,5.0,"One of the best cup of matcha latte I've had to date. It is unsweetened with just the right grainy texture. Combine that with some almond milk...perfection.

I secretly enjoy how the cafe is tucked away from plain sight (entrance is between 46th and 47th's open atrium on 6th) - makes grabbing a cup of Simon Sips kinda fun because most people are diverted to the Starbucks on 47th. The space isn't big and seems to always be occupied by professionals on coffee chats during the week. Their desserts and pastries are always tempting me, and they have a loyalty card that gets you your 7th cup free."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2018-08-07,5.0,Great customer service. Suggested to Simon that he open up a place in the Bay Area - California where there's too many Starbucks and Peet's and hardly any non- chain/franchises.
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2018-09-06,4.0,"The best matcha latte I found around the Rockefeller Center area so far! I used to go to Bibble and Sip, but recently they started to skim on the matcha, so by default I found Simon Sips. I have to say the staff is all very nice and welcoming, which is a perk! They do not skimp on the matcha, but over all I still love Ippodo Tea (but can't walk to 39th street for a coffee/matcha break haha). 

I have also gotten a chocolate croissant (go to Bouchon Bakery or La Pain Quotidien), which was sub-par and not as flaky as I would have liked. But, the ginger cookie is amazing! They also have a lot of breakfast items, which is great for on the go. 

I think this is a great place to grab a coffee that is not super touristy and crowded around the area. They are a bit hidden inside the building on 6th ave, but not terribly difficult to find.

*They have a punch card as well!"
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2016-07-12,5.0,"I tried the matcha latte. The tea is strong, 





So the entrance is between 46 and 47th the courtyard. Go from the 46th and 47th, instead of sixth avenues. 

The coffee is pretty good. It even accepts cups app. It also offers sandwiches and various pastries. It currently offers matcha latte too with ceremonial matcha. It's priced at par with Starbucks with real matcha instead of powder! I'm excited to try tomorrow."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2018-05-31,2.0,"Pretty good coffee, but the vibe is pretty weird, alas.  I often walk thinking I'm wearing a cheerful expression, only to be met with odd, often unwelcome glares from what seems to be the owner or manager. I will say that the support staff is more welcoming.

I appreciate that this is a small business trying to make it in big, bad midtown, but gazing at customers with intent less than welcome can't help. 

On the merits of just the coffee alone, four stars. With service in consideration, we're down to two.

Good luck."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2017-07-06,5.0,"This place is hidden around a corner inside a building off an alley that runs parallel to 6th ave, but it's worth the trek in. The cortado I had was everything you'd want to be: light, fluffy, a bit bitter, with a hint of sweet acidity at the end. Also, they were fast and super-friendly. I'll definitely be back. Finding a good cortado in every part of NY is going to take time, but I'm up for it.

The sweets looked really good too, but I didn't wind up getting any. The macaroons in particular were very tempting."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2019-02-19,5.0,Great find! Looking for a place to kill time and enjoy a latte. Their signage outside is the only way I found this gem of a place! Excellent latte delivered to me! Great customer service! Excellent coffee at a reasonable price.
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2015-05-15,2.0,"MMMM got a mouthful of delicious coffee grinds toward the bottom 1/4 of my medium hot coffee.  Delicious.  Yes, one could say ""oh, it happens"" and ""oh, it's normal"" or ""you probably got the bottom batch of the coffee"" etc, but I dont even get coffee grinds in my coffee at Starbucks.  There are many ways to avoid serving a customer coffee grinds.  Also, nobody offered me a punch card, but maybe I should have gotten one myself.

Simon Sips is hard to find, yes, but not if you know exactly where you're going.  Go west on 47th st until you see Utsav/a underpass under the 1185 Ave of the Americas Building and go in the rotating doors across from Utsav.  Then take a left and you'll see Simon Sips with its glass facade.

They serve a variety of coffee drinks from regular hot coffee, iced coffee, and espresso drinks (hot or cold).  Their bakery case includes baked goods from Ceci-Cela.

I ordered a medium drip coffee and immediately knew I was in a predicament when I saw a couple coffee grinds floating on top of my drink.  Oh well, maybe it's not so bad.  Then I get back to my desk, proceed to drink my coffee, and towards the bottom 1/4 of the cup, all I got were coffee grinds in my mouth and had to spit the coffee out.  Yes, the coffee served here is of very decent quality, but what's the point when you can't even finish it?  Even the last drip of coffee is vital to my productivity in the mornings.

I want to like Simon Sips, but unfortunately cannot because I personally don't drink coffee grinds - no excuses."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2018-07-05,1.0,"I came here because of review. I rely on Yelp for a good coffee close to my hotel.  Not very friendly. The barista let another customer cut in because I was writings down the order. As a deaf person it is very insulting and it's against ADA law. I tried to explain and he doesn't seem to care. This store need to be more aware. Especially it's 2018.. 

And the coffee wasn't that great. Wish I never came or spend my money on this ingroant business."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2018-01-18,3.0,The oatmeal raisin chocolate cookie was good but the seating was uncomfortable and the tables were a little too narrow for work. Good coffee and wii though.
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2014-10-08,5.0,"Simon is a phenomenon. He claims that coffee doesn't affect him, but he's definitely got something going on- he is up early daily and overseeing one of the best hidden gem coffee shops in NYC. 

It's totally worth the treasure hunt to find them tucked inside a corner of the office building 1185 Avenue of Americas. 

Attention to detail and quality are stellar- from bagels/lox from Russ & Daughters, to delicious steel cut oatmeal made fresh and slow-cooked overnight, cold overnight oats that are sweet and perfect with cinnamon, daily hot soups, handsomely-dressed baristas who remember your favorite drink, talented latte artists, and I could go on and on. Oh, and, the coffee is delicious. 

Simon greets 90% of his customers by name, and remembers what they wore last week."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2016-05-10,5.0,"You really gotta know the ""secret"" entrance before visiting otherwise you might find a hard time lol. However once you discovered the little gem hidden inside, everything was well worth it! 

It was a bit slow in the morning as everyone inside the building was trying to get their dose, but the Americano was of decent value (and with different sizes to choose from, which, not many coffee shops offer). Now I cannot wait to try out their tasty pastries displayed right in front...

So, who's Simon? Great taste!"
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2016-10-10,4.0,"If you're craving that afternoon coffee, Simon Sips is definitely a hidden Midtown gem. It's great for grab and go and best of all, if you are really needing the caffeination, their nitro brew is solid! Their nitro brew is so perfect for when I need an extra jolt and really gets me in the zone to just crank and be a work machine. 

Their sandwiches aren't bad either and Zabar's egg salad sandwich is almost as good as my mother's, if not better because they add dill. So genius! 

Come and grab a cookie and a coffee."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2017-11-16,5.0,I highly recommend this place. I work right next to it. I go almost every other day for their 8oz espresso. My friend went with me the first time cause it was impossible to find. It's tucked away in a corner inside a building. I tried a few pastries like almond croissant and the regular croissant( just normal ) I like their avocado toast. If you go in the morning there is barely anyone compare to lunch time/ afternoon coffee run. The people there are very nice and very attentive to help you. So close your eyes and pick something. Can't go wrong.
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2016-05-13,4.0,"Is it still a ""hidden gem"" if it's inside of a giant office building?

Yes, because it took me like 10 minutes to find it once I got to the location lol. After a few awkward minutes of me lurking around this building, I had such a nice experience!

The staff is SO nice -- the guy carried my latte over to where I was sitting (I got it to stay). I thought that was such a simple, nice thing to do that a lot of coffee shops in NYC definitely don't do. They were all so smiley and the manager even quickly asked me if I was happy and needed anything -- also another rare thing for a coffee shop, but I appreciated it. :)

I had a vanilla latte and it was really good! Latte art was also very well done, which I always appreciate as a barista myself.

The only thing about this place was the ""feel"" of the place (the ambiance) just kind of felt like...well, like I was in an office building, which I was. There aren't a lot of places to sit, but it just didn't have that ""cute coffee shop feel"" unfortunately, but it was very clean and it didn't really make or break my experience. 

Definitely coming back! :)

948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2014-02-08,4.0,"Excellent espresso and crafted coffee from Stumptown makes this no-frills, yet quaint, coffee spot a great spot for private conversations. It is not crowded given its relatively obscure location in the back of 1185 Ave of the Americas. 

The baristas are very friendly and not pretentious about their coffee knowledge as some other more well known coffee shops are. Yes, we know you know what a cortado is! 

Simon Sips resembles a modern amalgam between a Joe's and a bodega. Can't get better than that...and Stumptown!"

Four stars

Located inside an office building, Simon Sips is an energetic coffee shop servicing business types and the like. There is two counters for sitting with about 10 seats. I bet most take it to go. I ordered a cappuccino with half and half ($3.75) to stay. The coffee is robust, nutty, with nice lingering bitterness. The cup felt more like a latte because there was a lot of milk and virtually no foam. I got a punch card that I will never use but they give you 5 punches to start and your 11th drink of any size is free."

948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2017-08-14,5.0,"Ok, so after an entire month of searching for the best almond milk matcha latte in NY, I think this place is it... emphasis on ""searching,"" because I walked in/out/around this office building for like 20min trying to figure out how to get in (enter the office building from the back, where the atrium is, and turn left). 

Anyway, Simon Sips is a small, simple place, more for grabbing a drink & pastry to-go as opposed to sitting around & hanging for awhile. The staff was friendly, & I ordered a very expensive almond milk matcha latte (like $5-6 for 8oz?? Ok Manhattan). It was so, so worth it. No graininess, perfect foam (with art! I understand how difficult almond milk is to steam), great texture, bold matcha flavor... it was everything I had ever envisioned.

I might get lost finding Simon Sips again, but wow am I excited for my next matcha latte."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2018-04-17,5.0,"Fantastic well balanced coffee hidden away inside a building. If you are sick of burnt overly roasted coffee at silly prices this is you new spot. Friendly staff, coupon card for regulars and a nice selection of pastries. A hidden gem."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2017-09-09,5.0,"Delicious and very consistent espresso. Baristas are friendly, and happy to chat about coffee if you have any questions. 

Cookies and sandwiches are also delicious! Some of my favorite include the raspberry rugelach and the bagel with lox and cream cheese (Russ & daughters).

I personally preferred when they counter culture coffee instead of Parlour, but still visit regularly as the coffee and service continue to be excellent."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2016-02-26,4.0,"I love this little spot tucked away inside a corporate building!  Kind of jealous of the people who work in this building and can come to Simon Sips without going outside.  

The people here are superbly friendly.  Once I was waffling (as usual) between two soups, settled on ordering one, to have the guys behind the counter insist that I try both soups.  Both were in fact delicious.  They always have one meat option and a vegetarian option, sometimes more than one.   So far I've had the three bean chili and the tomato & feta, both were super yummy and satisfying. 

Coffee has been delicious too, as is their green tea & lemon cookie, which I finally succumbed to today. 

Price wise it's right -- large soups are around $5 for depending on whether you get vegetarian or meat, and it's definitely one of the best soup deals in the area.  I got a latte with almond milk, a large soup, and a cookie for under $10.  

In addition to the quality food & coffee, I think I enjoy coming here because the people working here seem genuinely happy and chill.  At Starbucks, Financier, or Bouchon, I feel as though I am talking to employees of a large chain (which I am).  Here there seems to be more of a family feel.  Odd for a coffeeshop in midtown, but there you have it.   I'm not sure how you could have a bad experience here with the people, unless perhaps you have a clinical case of RBF.  

I don't think they have their own app but you can pay using LevelUp powered app."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2017-07-13,5.0,"A MUST FIND! 

I'm a huge fan of their matcha lattes. I also enjoy their breakfast options. Decent prices. Customer service is on point too. Worth the try!"
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2015-08-13,3.0,"Coffee is good, but not great.  

Think the hype is because of the lack of good coffee spots in the Midtown Center area (around 5th & 6th Ave).

I know that they serve Stumptown coffee and I had their Russ & Daughters Bagel & Smoked Salmon, but both tasted inferior to their respective original locations on 8th Street (Stumptown) and Houston Street (Russ & Daughters).  They just don't seem to travel well.

Location is hard to find as people have mentioned, but the service is good and pretty quick, so, not a bad place if you want something better than your run-of-the-mill coffee, but for great coffee, I prefer going to Kaffe 1668 two blocks away on 5th Avenue & 45th Street and getting their pour-over coffee, which is excellent, albeit a little pricier."
948,simon-sips-new-york-4,2015-06-22,1.0,"Bad coffee and fake positive customer service.  I was looking for this place through the cups app and it was so difficult, being that it's hidden within the back lobby of an office building.  Not convenient at all.

I have been ordering coffee from them for a short while just because they have the cups app, but if I were to get my coffee, I would definitely rather go somewhere else.  However, after today I will not step in here again.

Personally I had a rough night before this morning and I was not only without caffeine, but also without a peaceful heart.  I'm sorry if I did not SMILE at you Mr. Barista, but you do NOT have the right to give me YOUR own attitude when I was already having a rough start to the week.

He was ready to ring me up and asked me what my order was, and I answered him ""small cold brew"" and handed him my phone to punch in the code.  I guess he didn't hear me, but I was also nodding and my eyes were glazed over (it was a rough night) -- It even took me a while to realize wow this guy is pissed at ME.  He turned to his co-worker and was like ""is she serious?!"" I was so so so confused.  Was I wearing the resting btch face all this time?

REGARDLESS, MR CASHIER/BARISTA -- I did NOT need your attitude.  I was already giving you a confused look and all you said was ""BYE"".  NOPE, you cannot treat people like that, what if I had like a mental disability that did not allow me to be aware at the time, huh? You're not even forgiving to a sleepy customer...ridiculous.

Thanks so much for already ruining my already ruined week.  I'll be keeping my money away from y'all now."

It is sometimes difficult to find a independent coffee place around midtown (blue bottle is the only other I can think of), so it's a pleasant find. I always see the owner Simon around the shop which is pretty cool. Simon is really nice and on my first visit he asked me how I came to the store and he punched my coffee card 5 times as a welcoming. 

The coffee is yummy as well. I ordered a latte both times and I was very satisfied with the taste. The other staff are also very nice. Would come back again and again. This place gets really packed during peak coffee times, so you know it's good!"

I also like coming here for offsite meetings with team members, junior staff as well as clients who want to meet up for a quick chat.  

It is not right on an avenue and feels a bit more secluded like you won't bump into or be interrupted by someone from your office every few minutes.  There is not a ton of seating, but they do have small, 2 person tables and I always seem to be able to find a place to park myself."

The shop has few sit down tAbles, a bench to look out the front window and standing high tops. Enjoy!!!"
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-09-18,5.0,"Macchiato Espresso Bar is conveniently located on the same street as my hotel and also on my way to work. I decided to grab a latte and some breakfast. The barista and cashier were both super friendly and nice early in the morning!

I ordered a latte with 2% milk along with a garlic bagel (cream cheese on the side). Wow, I was super impressed with the quality of the latte because it was so good! The hot beverage was rich and creamy from the steamed milk. I felt instantly caffeinated but without the jitters. 

Garlic bagel was absolutely delicious. There's not a ton of baked garlic bits stuck onto the bagel, but I can definitely taste the garlic flavor. It went so well with the cream cheese that I was blown away. My first fresh NY bagel experience was a success!

Overall, Macchiato Espresso Bar is probably my favorite place to pickup coffee in NY. I will definitely come back if I ever visit the city again."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-04-16,4.0,"Lovely espresso bar in the heart of Midtown East, adjacent to Grand Central. Macchiato Espresso Bar offers a great cup of coffee, attentive service and cozy nook to escape your bustling surrounding.

Selection of coffee options are very good, they offer pastries, as well as food menu items! All things done right. 

Keep it up, M!"

As soon as I walk in today it felt like an unclean bodega down any block in nyc. I still wanted to try the coffee. 

Got a small iced mocha. With tip it was around $7. Quite pricy compared to other good options. 

The coffee has no body and lacks flavor. No taste of coffee beans being roasted nicely. I had to throw away the coffee because it was so bad! 

They would be well served if they changed their coffee beans quickly. 

Such a shame that for a great looking cafe it lacks good quality coffee."

Their cold brew just can't be beat. I only needed one cup of cold brew and I was good for the whole day. It's a strong cup but doesn't leave you jittery.

The pastries are all baked on site and look great. It seemed like everyone was buying the food from there, although I wasn't in the mood to eat.

Will come back here for coffee and pastry, and will bring a friend next time! Awesome vibes, too!!"

949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2015-06-14,4.0,"Excellent coffee for an afternoon caffeine fix! I love the simplicity of the decor and it makes it so easy for me to forget about stress at work during my stay. 

Gooey Chocolate Chip Cookie and the Cappuccino are my go-to combo here. The cookie was super soft and the chocolate chip is melted on the inside. It is the best, if you can get it just fresh out of the oven. I love the chewy texture and just the right about of sweet to help lift up my energy. Cappuccino is my favorite coffee of choice anywhere. Its espresso, hot milk, and foam milk had the perfect proportion here at Macchiato. My sweet treat and my coffee is a perfect balance of bittersweetness. I personally prefer my coffee hot but iced versions are just as good for any summer day! I would like to see Macchiato work on their latte art, it is quite boring on the eyes. 

For those who work in the immediate area, you know that the coffee competition is heated around here. I am proud to say that Macchiato earns one of the top spots on my list. Skip your office's coffee from the pot or Keurig and treat yourself! You deserve it!"

They gave me a $20 gift card because I complained about my sandwich!  They also put a complementary chocolate cookie (delicious by the way) in the bag with my replacement sandwich. The people who work there are so friendly and nice.  I've tried 4 of the sandwiches and the Caesar Salad -- everything is my favorite -- it's hard to choose.
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-08-06,4.0,"One of my favorite places to get espresso and cappuccino. If you like good quality coffee drinks and work in the grand central area, you won't be disappointed. Quality is exceptional. Great pastries and lunch items as well. Cafe is small so it's not ideal for groups."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2016-03-17,4.0,"As someone who has plowed through most of life without an ounce of caffeine (the strongest drink to me is a cup of green tea and even that I'm incapable of finishing), the appeal of coffee shops is kind of lost on me, unless I also eat a pastry. I must have walked past Macchiato quite a few times without realizing the buried treasure that lay within - their chocolate chip cookie. 

I take chocolate chip cookies very seriously. That five star rating for Levain is no laughing matter - I like mine towering and warm and pudding soft in the middle with a slightly crispy edge. Hand me a crispy cookie or an oatmeal cookie and I'll question your integrity (just kidding, I'm still not over that one time I ate a chunk of an oatmeal cookie and realized what it was). The two reigning champions of CCCs for me are Levain and Zaro's tollhouse cookie. Macchiato's has knocked Zaro's off second base. It's a bit more compact but it's absolutely stuffed with chocolate chunks (not chips). I can eat one every day. 

Which brings me to my next point. Ever dipped a cookie into an iced chai latte before? Probably not as good as a cookie dipped in coffee but I was extremely pleased for the rest of that afternoon. 

There are quite a few seats but it was packed on a regular weekday afternoon and ear-crackingly loud. I wouldn't really bring work to do here or try to set up a conference call. However, it is perfect for ducking in and grabbing the essentials. And yes, the service was very fast. I paid, turned around to put my purse back, and my iced chai was ready. 

NEXT TIME: uh duh. Their sandwiches look good too."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-10-11,2.0,Wicked expensive and not very good. Watery espresso and small sizes. Barely mixed my mocha. Only used one shot so it was very milky. With the other options in the area I'd hunt those out.
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2015-03-13,2.0,"I've had very mixed experiences at this place, which is frustrating. I've had GREAT lattes/cappucinos (thus the four star rating before) and very meh lattes. The last two times I asked for my lattes extra hot (because they tend to go cold within 2-3 minutes when I head out the door), and they have still been giving me lukewarm (barely warm), watered down drinks. Today's drink tasted completely watered down-- like the milk wasn't fresh, and I couldn't taste the espresso at all. I've asked for double shots of espresso before and am pretty sure I have never received the second shot. They also once messed up my drink and gave me a mocha instead of a latte. 

For $4.50+ a latte, it's expensive for what can be undependable morning service? 

That said, the pastries are fantastic! And the staff is always friendly."

949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2014-06-05,4.0,"Like Zoolander, I never go left out of my building. I had this epiphany just a minute ago as I was leaving Macchiato Espresso Bar wondering why I'd never ventured there before. It's because I literally never ever, not 1% of the time, travel in that direction. Weird. I'm def. going exploring soon.

I was craving a chocolate chip cookie so I went to the Pret closest to me, but there was something about staring into the glass case that wasn't appealing today. I whipped out the yelp app and typed 'cookie' into the search. The first place that popped up with a good rating was Macchiato Espresso Bar (A Grade).

I'd only planned on the cookie, but I ended up deciding to try the Iced Coffee as well. The cookies are square looking, and I was hoping that people wouldn't be all hyped up because of the shape. I got my Iced Coffee and proceeded to knock it over on the counter. oops. My reflexes were quick so only some spilled out and the employees were really nice about it. 

I went to the self-serve station to put some half and half into my coffee. I like these containers way better than Starbucks. Starbucks creamer containers make me anxious. I'm always waiting for the lid to fall off the top, which is why I hold in on, but it's all very awkward when carrying stuff. These were a press top. Press the button and the half & half comes out. Easy peasy. 

Ate my cookie at the office. It was still warm & gooey. If I had eaten it there, I would have had to buy another one. I'll have to make it a rule that I don't do that. 

yelp search success! I'll definitely be back!"
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2015-05-09,5.0,"Macchiato is a wonderful espresso bar.  I frequented this joint three times last week while residing at the hotel next door.  On all 3 occasions I had a large cappuccino.  In all three cases they were perfect, hot and served within seconds.  In all 3 cases the staff were super nice.

Place is well organized and everything Starbucks will never be.  They even offer a premium cocoa powder to dust your drinks with.

I will definitely be back when I need a caffeine fix near Grand Central Station."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2016-08-26,4.0,"Best cookie in the city. No joke - forget Levain, forget Jaques Torres. It's this unassuming, under-the-radar coffee shop in midtown with a cookie that could become world famous any day now. 

Also surprisingly good? The tuna salad sandwich. Yum. How do you make an exceptional tuna salad sandwich? Macchiato figured it out. The chicken caesar salad is good too, but ridiculously small and overpriced. The coffee is good, but forgettable.

Worth noting - the cookies at their 666 Fifth Avenue location aren't nearly as good as this location's as they're often over baked. Must be the bad juju at that address..."

I went today and saw it was mildly busy. Baristas were friendly. On the wall, they have coffee cups and saucers glued to the walls (cute). As always, I try the place first with just a regular coffee; it wasn't anything special. I may though give it another chance considering I saw the baked goods that people are raving about if I pass by tomorrow."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2016-03-16,4.0,"Cappuccino, served hot and creamy in a proper cup, and best of all, tasted like real Euro coffee.  Music was loud but I guess I was in a good mood and digging it. Good internet connection. 

The only negative had nothing to do with Macchiato. The guy next to me felt compelled to call everyone from his phone contact list to let them know he was enjoying coffee for ""a New York minute."" Was more like thirty minutes. Since the music was loud, so was he. I felt like he was talking to me the entire time. Whatever."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2014-03-06,4.0,"Another day, another sandwich...but at an espresso bar? 

I'm not a big coffee  drinker, so I've past Macchiato countless times without even giving a thought to going in. It wasn't until I was strolling through the area looking for an interesting lunch that their menu posted on the door caught my eye. The sandwich choices were unique considering the other options in the area, and for the most part it's affordable. I got the prosciutto sandwich sans olive tapenade and it was great! It's lovely to be able to select from their fresh breads...although the croissant was a bit too light for the contents of the sandwich, it's buttery flakiness was the perfect compliment! This sandwich got me coming back and I accidentally forgot to ask for no tapenade--completely changes the sandwich. I'm really not a fan, but I do feel that even if you were it overpowers the other ingredients of the sandwich, so avoid it!

As for their other offerings, my co-worker raves about the espresso, and their macarons are provided by Macarons and Cookies by Woops and aren't half bad. 

All in all, I'd suggest Macchiato if you are looking to mix-up your midtown lunch."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2015-07-24,4.0,"First of all, the exterior is oh so charming with a hint of vintage flare. It really is a beautiful place with a clean white interior and a very nice wooden bar by the window for people watching. It is only a few blocks from Grand Central on 44th, a rather quiet and lovely spot in Midtown East. The coffee (I chose a cappuccino) was excellent. My cappuccino had a fantastic layer of rich velvety foam on top, which is how it should always be. It was like a little fluffy pillow on top of my espresso. The espresso itself had a nice flavor and was the perfect strength. Probably one of the most satisfying cappuccinos I've had in the city: no frills, but just wonderful.

If you do come here, do not leave before trying their infamous chocolate chip cookies. They were absolutely outrageous and totally sinful- very reminiscent of Levain cookies with the soft and gooey centers. The chocolate was a more bittersweet variety which made for an excellent bite with the soft doughy center. Just fantastic, and only $1.25! Definitely one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had in my life."

949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2014-09-17,4.0,"Pretty excellent spot in an otherwise awful location for good coffee. The espresso here is quite good with an almost lemony undertone. Also, the people who work here are super nice and they serve up food and coffee FAST.

I didn't think the chocolate chip cookies here were anything to write home about, especially in a city where Levain Bakery is doing their thing. They just didn't taste that much different from any mid-level cookie.  

All in all, however, this place is definitely a good stop for those of you who don't mind fighting your way through a ton of businesspeople and midtown banker boys to score some fairly solid joe."

I love their Gotham Mocha when I'm not trying to be buzzed on energy, but if not, the iced coffee is my favorite. Locally roasted beans and super friendly staff make this one of the best alternatives to chain coffee shops around the city. Not the most ideal place to do work in, however, since there are only a few seats with spotty wifi connection and no restroom in the vicinity.
As a self-titled Cookie Monster, the rainbow cookies here are one of my favorite pick me up treats. They sell out before 3 PM on most days, so make sure to get your hands on them in the morning. They're kept warm for the cookie doughey center to melt in your mouth and ooze some of the chocolate nestled in a sugary, happy, rainbow cookie. The cookie monster is a close second if the rainbow cookie is sold out, but the warm center in all of their stuffed cookies compel you to eat it right then."

Staff: I guess it depends on when you go. Our first visit had 2 baristas working  and you could totally tell that one of them was not in the mood to be at work.  She didn't smile once and when people asked her questions, although she was helpful, she seemed very unhappy to be there.  

Location: A couple of high top tables with some bench seating in the back of the cafe.  I guess it could be a place to work or study if you can grab a seat in the back.  

Coffee: Hubs thought the cappuccino was okay; not one of his favorites but okay.  Again, I was a big fan of the matcha latte and would definitely come here again just for that."

I get annoyed when I'm charged for something that I didn't order, and it was too late for me to get the cost remedied by the time I noticed it. However, the barista was really nice and accommodating to a fellow customer while I was waiting for my drinks, and I found the cinnamon and apple danish nice without being too sweet. My flat white was standard and well done. 

Lofty ceilings. Handful of high top and regular tables to hang out a while."

Five Stars for Five Coffee Roasters because I loved it. While I was visiting NYC and putting on my tourist hat, I was in dire need of coffee after running around Times Square trying to snag RUSH tickets for a broadway show.

I wasn't in the mood for a small bite at the time but they have plenty of baked goods to enjoy and I appreciatted their menu.

The decor was very welcoming and I loved the high ceilings. For those of us who enjoy studying/working out of coffee shops they had three work tables in the very back. 

The rest of the seating is bar seating against the walls except for a two person table underneath their ""mantra wall"".

My iced latte was delicious and what I enjoyed was that it wasn't sweet and very well balanced. The coffee they source is very high quality and I didn't feel a sugar crash with their in-house syrup. 

Solid spot if you're in the area and you have to check it out. Went on a Saturday and they do close earlier just a heads up."
950,for-five-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2020-01-01,3.0,"It's me. It's not you. Everything in NYC is small and snug and I'm just not a fan of that aspect. I say that to say this coffee spot was packed, probably because the drinks were great. There were about 4 small tables smushed together and we grabbed one by sheer luck. Unfortunately, I had to go to the bathroom and they didn't have one. Curious. How do the staff go while they are at work. Anyway, we had to leave our table so I could go find a bathroom which was a first world problem but still sucked. 
My latte was delicious. Just as creamy, hot and caffeinated as I'd expect. Even though it was crowded and busy, fast-paced, my drink was made with care which I appreciate. Don't go on a weekend if you expect to sit, relax and chat. Oh wait, I was there on a Tuesday at 2pm. Nevermind, it's probably always that busy!"
950,for-five-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-04-30,3.0,"I've been to For Five's Long Island location several times, and was excited to try their midtown location. There's very few seating (a few tables and a couple high-tops), and it gets packed during lunchtime, so keep that in mind if you're planning to meet someone at this spot. There's some outlets, a few, but they're there. 

The coffee snob in me deems the coffee to be excellent, and they have all the milks available (almond, oat, macadamia), which they'll steam at no extra charge. Pricing is at par with surrounding cafes, maybe .50 more, no biggie. 

So why the three stars? I got the grilled chicken wrap as well, which is premade in the display by the door. The ingredients aren't listed up there, and not only was the sandwich overly drenched in sauce, but also it turned out to have lots of bacon. I'm surprised this isn't included in the display name, because what if someone buys the $10 sandwich and can't eat it? I went to tell the manager, and he couldn't seem to care less. His demeanor was disappointing, especially because I think these types of dietary needs should be acknowledged. He actually tried to defend himself by taking out a menu with the ingredients, which was hidden behind the counter underneath other papers and written in the tiniest print. No customer can see this where you are keeping it! 

Anyway, he and the rest of the staff seemed to be pretty dismissive the entire time I was there, but the coffee and the atmosphere are great."

I was looking at the menu on the board when the staff told me to wait behind the person on the other end as this customer was ordering. There was nobody else waiting in line and I was still looking at the menu. I found that rude.

My friend placed her order then took a call as we were waiting for her drink. The staff called out her drink and I acknowledged her while my friend was still on a call. After a few more minutes, the staff shouted at us to say that my friend's drink was ready. I was really annoyed at this point so I told her that my friend is still on the phone. I don't know if she's having a bad day or she just hates women because she's so sweet to other male customers. This was a bad experience and I don't care how nice the place is or how good the drinks are but I'm not coming back here again."

Located in the midtown Convene conference space, For Five is the change of pace (aka not Starbucks, although I love Starbucks too!) you were looking for for your mid-day coffee fix. They have a selection of salads and sandwiches as well, although I've only had the pastries here - definitely get the Cookie Monster cookie if you're craving something sweet while you're here! I usually got an iced americano, and am a fan of the espresso served here - strong, solid and aromatic.

This coffee shop actually doesn't feel like NYC; it feels like Seattle (where I'm originally from).
It's pretty quiet and mellow inside with old jazz music playing, and there wasn't too much of a line even though I visited in the morning. The baristas are super friendly too (also probably why it feels more like Seattle haha). 
It's definitely more of a take-out-and-go kind of coffee shop, but they have seating available for about 10-15 people. It's really clean and bright here; I can see myself working or reading here. 

The coffee tastes really good, but their baked goods selection is good too. They have pastries (croissants, muffins...) and cookies (fruity pebble cookies, rainbow cookies, red velvet cookies...).
I didn't get a chance to explore the bakery options, but everything looked really tasty."

Very limited seating so you'd best take it to go. 

Definitely will try the cold brew soon, and those cookies!"

I asked the guy at the register if they still had the blue cookies and he said they never had blue cookies. So I ordered a red velvet cookie. It's definitely big, and very buttery.

I checked photos on yelp later, and they did indeed have blue cookies. Disappointed with my experience here."

They roast their own beans and the coffee is incredible. The cold brew is especially amazing (just as good as Stumptown's, but slightly different).

I noticed that everything here is high quality, from the sturdy cups and straws to the awesome napkins. I also think the patterned cups and cup sleeves are look pretty aesthetic. You can just tell their materials are on a different level.

Oh yea, for the cookie lovers, For Five gets bonus points because it's one of the few places that sells the infamous (hard-to-find, amazing, sometimes stuffed, basically crack) Duchess cookies."

950,for-five-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-02-10,3.0,"In a town where great coffee places are literally on every block, this one is just barely above average. . 

It has all of the warmth of a 19th century diphtheria ward. That's not aided by the equally hip duo who work the coffee bar in that us-against-the-public kind of way that they have that barista force field up where they chatter to each other, and open the invisible door long enough to deign to take your order. 

High ceilings. White, and very sterile, with the usual pseudo-clever hipster homage to the five boroughs, and a huge back wall with faux-intriguing wallpaper of artists art and art in motion, scattered over a two-story high white space. All countered by a smattering of dark wood at the counter and the waste stations.

They have four tables and a wall bar in this massive space. Even emptier on a chilly Saturday morning, the tables are dirty and unattended. Man-bun-boi grabs a bottle of windex to clean the hospital walls, but never touches a table. When it got busier they patrons cleaned up to find a place to sit. 

The lack of tables, and their disregard for them suggests that you move on. That's easy on a bustling spring day, but not when it's 12F outside. Their doors and the main door to the street are not well built for cold days. Every time someone came in, a ride of cold air swept through this over-lit hipster mausoleum. 

For a place with a paucity of pastries, you would think that the coffee would be better. It's low acid, but it lacks flavor, depth of any character, and it would probably help the guy with the man-bun to use a thermometer so the milk isn't tepid. 

That it has this kind of ranking with Yelpers maybe means more Manhattan masochists, who want to be caffeinatedly punished frequent this place. Had it not been for the bitter cold, I would have happily gone elsewhere for my morning mud."

Pros:
Very good coffee, I love the latte here.
Very friendly staff. 
They have Chinese songs on the playlist. I think it's a plus!
They have a cute bench outside, nice to sit down and read in spring and summer while you enjoy your coffee 

Cons:
The place is too small. Wish they have more seats!"

The Jolly Goat was near my Airbnb and I needed to get a quick cup of coffee before starting my day. This little shop is so cozy and, like other reviews have said, the baristas are so nice and patient.

The barista is also really nice and very helpful -- gave us free samples when we were deciding which coffee to get.

So meh, I wouldn't want to pay 4.25 for that. I'd rather make it at home. 

The end result is not bad. Hence four star."

My hubby and I both had this place cook marked after we ate breakfast and wanted some thing warm and with some pep! Aka  coffee.

The coffee dude was Hilarious and explained to me how Starbucks has bastardized coffee, I really appreciate him schooling me and stoping me from getting something that I didn't know I would want. 

If we ever end up in Manhattan we will check this place out again. The service  was super fast and I enjoyed the very enthusiastic young man behind the counter. 

The only reason I am not giving this place five stars is because there is not much seating and I wish there was, still a great spot."

I'm giving 3 stars because we awkwardly waited for quite awhile as the manager (owner?) counted the drawer.  I understand that changing over employees requires register counts and I'm happy to wait, but the employees didn't address the line at all.  A polite, ""Sorry, just one more minute!"" would have made it a less uncomfortable wait. 

That being said, the peanut butter cookie was tasty and the coffee was also pretty good.  This place is rather small, but there was enough room for my two friends and I.  The experience didn't really stand out as one of my favorites, but I would try them again!"

Although this coffee shop offers free wifi, there are literally four (4) seats inside and a small bench at the storefront.  However, most patrons take their beverages to-go.  

Wow, I was blown away by the Brooklyn-brewed Dona chai.  Nothing was wish-washy.  The flavor was concentrated, yet the balance of each spice that was involved with the brewing process was still distinct.  

They serve Stumptown Coffee.  I believe they were originally from Portland, Oregon.  However, they have branched out to Seattle, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and New York.  Hubby had the cafe au lait.  Umm...what a smooth cup of coffee!  Overall, it was nice to visit a indie coffee shop in another city.  

Hubby and I may make it back here before heading back to Chicago.  If not, farewell, The Jolly Goat."

952,rex-new-york-2,2020-03-05,4.0,"Cute little neighborhood coffee shop with limited seating and personable baristas. 

I was looking for a place to sit and work - Rex was pretty crowded at 10am on a Thursday so I didn't stay, but I did grab a yummy egg, tomato and cheese sandwich on croissant. Toasted just right, and wrapped well to minimize leaking.

The baristas seemed to know all the customers coming in, and were chatting with them about everything from Equinox to financial trading (I guess that's the UWS for ya!). I'm not a super chatty type, and the barista could probably sense this as he didn't try to make too much small talk -- an extra star in my book, ha!"
952,rex-new-york-2,2020-02-17,2.0,"DO NOT come here if you're in a rush. 

I don't really get this place. I've walked past it dozens of times and it always seems popular/busy. Today on a quiet president's day afternoon i decided to pop in and pick up a couple of coffees before heading to meet some friends. 

Walked in and it was pretty quiet - a couple of people waiting for orders and one person in front of me in the queue. I couldn't see a menu but asked for 2 flat whites. The friendly hispanic girl behind the counter looked stumped by my order and asked if flat white was a cappuccino. Not a good sign. Deciding that trying to explain the difference between flat white/cappuccino/latte seemed like a fool's errand so I switched my order to lattes. 

Then moments later one of the waiting customer's orders popped up - ""flat white""! Wtf?! Maybe my accent threw them...

10 minutes later and I'm still waiting for my order. The barista is taking an inordinate amount of time over every coffee. Part of the hold up seems to be his insistence on practicing latte art on every drink even if it's a take away. Tbh I'm not fussed about latte art if it's going in a take out cup but if you're taking this long it had better be pretty special art. It was not. You can get better latte art out of a Nespresso frother - anyone who's tried to do so knows the low bar that sets. 

The coffee itself wasn't bad but wasn't particularly good either and after all that wait and build up it would have had to be spectacular. Playing devil's advocate maybe the food is the draw here rather than the coffees?

I get the impression that this is a place for hipsters to hang out in with their laptops and who have nowhere else they need to be. It's fine. It's just very underwhelming."
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-12-11,4.0,"I'm not much of a coffee drinker, so I can't comment on the quality of their drinks, but the sandwich I had was delicious.

You can build your own breakfast sandwich which comes with two eggs on your choice of brioche, 9 grain, croissant, or no bread. You can then add toppings like cheese, bacon, tomato, ham, salsa verde, etc. I went with two eggs on a croissant with cheese and bacon. It took a few minutes to prepare because they were pretty busy, and the sandwiches are made to order, but it was perfection when I finally got it. The croissant was perfectly flaky and warm. One of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had.

There isn't much seating inside. Two medium-sized tables that I guess are supposed to be used as communal seating, but in my opinion they're much too intimate and cramped to sit down and get some work done."
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-09-11,5.0,"I'm always on the prowl for the best B.E.C. (Bacon, Egg, Cheese) sandwich in New York. The latest Yelp buzz has been buzzing about Rex. 

A B.E.C. is a classic New York breakfast sandwich. From Montauk to Battery Park, all of us want this simple sandwich to welcome the morning. I usually have a B.E.C. on the weekends, it's the equivalent of a breakfast high five. This is the reason why I came to Rex, great coffee being brewed along with a freshly made breakfast.

Walking in, this is a very small spot. Order, eat and split, there are people waiting to sit at the communal table.

I was expecting to see egg sandwich suggestions, nope. Build your own B.E.C. based on the choices on the board. When I got to the counter, I froze! I knew I wanted Chorizo but I forget the cheese.. I ordered a E.C, Eggs and Chorizo on freshly made Brioche bun. I chased it with a latte.

This simple sandwich was a rock star! The eggs were made perfectly and the chorizo gave a nice kick. 

While sitting, I see Hasan Minhaj from the Daily Show across from me. The place is crowded, he's with, I assuming his wife and baby. So I sit, I munch on my E.C. and bolt out.

Rex makes a danm good breakfast sandwich. If you're in the area, I highly recommend having breakfast at Rex."

The espresso was okay and coffee was pretty bad. My boyfriend basically dumped the whole cup in the trash. I got a croissant with egg, cheese and tomato and it was nothing impressive. My boyfriend got the burrito and it was pretty small and only okay. The space is incredibly small and always feels crowded. Honestly, I probably won't be back."

I went with a latte for my sister and a cappuccino with almond milk for me. They have no flavors or sweeteners here so keep that in mind. I like things without sugar but my sister has a sweet tooth, so I just added some liquid cane syrup to hers and she loved it. Will be back!"

I would suggest to do grab and go. 

Their Cuban sandwich and it is delicious! Juicy and flavorful slow roast pork topped with a slice of perfectly seasoned cured bacon and a small pickle. My friend from Cuba viewed this as the best Cuban sandwich in town!"
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-12-07,5.0,"As a visitor to NY, Rex is one of the spots that I would dream of having as my ""neighborhood stop"". Its small space is cozy & intimate for a breakfast with a friend, and the service is quick and super friendly. 

I went for the classic Egg Sandwich. Mine came on brioche, which I think is the default & I had no problems with that. In addition to the 2 eggs, there is a myriad of extra toppings that you can throw into your sammy. I went with a CAT (cheese, avo & tomato) -- I HIGHLY recommend. The cheese was so gooey and stringy; see attached photo. 

I also snagged a slice of the Butternut Squash loaf. The flavor was wholesome and earthy, just like a BSquash! My one complaint is that it was a bit dry and crumbly. 

Overall though, the Sammy's are the star of Rex. You can't go wrong with a classic egg sandwich, but my sister lives down the street and says their Cuban sandwich is on point too. I will definitely come back for a latte & breakfast sandwich next time I'm in the area!"
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-05-27,5.0,"Tucked on a nondescript corner of W57th and 10 avenue, lies this heavenly gem Rex. Came here with a friend from out of town for a quick brunch at ~12pm. Boy was it packed! We ordered 2 foot-long cuban sandwiches ($10, these are to DIE for), one large iced tea ($3), and one iced mocha ($5). Total bill came to $28 tax and tip no included.

AMBIANCE:
Rex is a trendy coffee shop, but they also make breakfast options such as breakfast burritos. Shop is quite small, as they only have two tables that can seat about 5 people each, making total seating occupancy at 10 patrons. This gem does get packed so beware!

PROS:
Cuban sandwich is imo the best in the city! They toasted their bread to a nice crisp, splatter a healthy dose of mustard and mustard inside, lather it with a few pieces of pickles, and in between these two golden brown crisps of a bread they put in sliced pork belly and cuban ham/jamon! The meat was so tender and juicy, and the jamon adds a ton of smokiness to the sandwich. You can still hear the crackling sounds of the bread when you press against it, clearly telling us that they make their cuban sandwiches on the spot!

Best part is, this sandwich is massive! As a foot-long, it definitely filled me up, and it only cost $10! 

Drinks were good to. The iced tea comes unsweetened to my liking thus you can adjust the sweetness level based on your own preferences. Ice mocha had a good balance of coffee and milk, and also comes unsweeteened like your typical coffee you order from any shop. 

Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and granted my request by taking time out of their busy lunch line to refill the water station.

OVERALL:
Highly recommend Rex and their cuban sandwiches! Best deal for the best flavors you can get in Manhattan!"
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-05-12,5.0,"Rex is my place to stave off a hangover, to read a book when it's raining, or when I have nothing better to do and I want to have an hour-long conversation with my friends.

Seating space is limited to two tables with communal seating, but there always seems to be a spot that opens up while your latte is prepared. It's always comforting to sit and enjoy a coffee with your fellow residents of Hell's Kitchen. Very relaxed vibe.

I'm a big fan of their breakfast sandwiches (with salsa verde) and the Cubanos. I'm going to buy a Rex mug to use at home too."
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-10-28,4.0,"I stopped here for lunch on a work from home day! It was only a couple blocks away from where I was staying, and the reviews for the sandwiches looked tooo good.

I got a half Cuban for $6, and it was so wanna me toasty when it arrived (a nice change of pace from a cold sandwich at coffee shops). It came with a pickle which was the perfect compliment! It was a tad on the smaller side, but for the location and it being a local place, it was a good price for me! 

I also just got a latte, which was pretty good as well. I will say that it is very small, and only has about 10 seats total. So I wouldn't recommend on planning to stay for long or use they spotty-ish wi-fi. It's also on the louder side because of the music, but that didn't bother me much!"

Awesome egg sandwich. Delicious latte. Place is small so hard to get a seat if there are campers on their computers; we got lucky. Highly recommend and would love to come back here.
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-10-06,5.0,"Great taste. Very limited options. Small sitting place.
Every sandwich starts with an egg which was a bit off putting for me initially. But they will make sandwiches without egg and will also discount them if you want, which was cool. The coffee was pretty good. But it took no time for the barista to get our drinks ready and had to wait for the sandwiches for a while. So that's something to keep in mind.
Since its a small place it gets really crowded with people waiting to order and pickup their stuff. My advice to people who are sitting at the tables would be to be respectful and not linger very long after you are done eating at least during rush hours, it will free up some space for people waiting for their orders (I did see a few people with empty plates and cups just sitting there doing their work this is not a place for that for sure)"
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-09-08,1.0,"HORRIBLE!! I don't know what happened because I used to like this place but for a while now I've had a consistently bad experience. I can't tell you how many times I have called in my breakfast order for pick up because I can't bring my dog in (and they take several minutes to make) and so I want to run in quickly to pick it up when it's ready. I call ahead and four out of five times it's not ready because the person working forgot to put in the order

you don't even get a real apology it's like oh I'm sorry I forgot you'll have to wait. The time before last this happened I asked the manager to call me and I never heard from anybody. 

Being that this has happened so many times and again this morning ( I'm walking away without breakfast because I don't have time to wait), NEVER GOING AGAIN"

As I waited in line, I watched a girl eat her avocado toast which looked delicious. There were 4 people in front of me, but it only took about 3 minutes for me to get my coffee. If you like strong dark roast coffee, you'll like Rex's coffee. They also do pour overs and have outdoor seating for when the weather is a little warmer.

952,rex-new-york-2,2019-03-15,5.0,"I finally have a neighborhood coffee shop. I've heard people talk about having one--a place where everyone knows your name or whatever. They might not know my name here, but I think they do know that I like the cookies. I hope they do, at least, because I make a point of saying it every time I order one and also make a point of sighing dramatically when there aren't any left. The cookies are best when they are mushy inside, which normally happens when they are fresh out of the oven and haven't been cooked all the way. I'd tell you when this happens, but I haven't figured out the cookie-baking schedule. Coffee is very good, and the lattes are always yummy. Love the mocha as it doesn't taste sickly sweet. They have oat milk. Here are some comments on the food items I've tried:

Blueberry muffin: Not too sweet, blueberries taste fresh even though they are all cooked up.

Banana bread: Best I've ever had. No exaggeration! Packed with real bananas, soft without tasting over-buttered. I dream about this. They had a loaf with chocolate chips once, and I almost died eating it (in a good way). 

Egg sandwiches: Reasonably priced. Eggs cooked to perfection. The brioche buns are excellent. The cheese is what really makes these. I recommend bacon over sausage and adding avocado with the cheese. It would be great to have a turkey bacon or sausage option for those who don't eat pork. 

Cookies: I have one almost every day with a drip coffee, so there must be something to them. Only thing is that they are better some days than others, but they are never, ever BAD. My friend loves the cowboy cookie (peanuts, oats, chocolate), but I am more traditional and tend to stick with the regular chocolate chip."

Didn't quite meet the five star mark because it simply wasn't a WOW experience and my chai latte was with foam. Try again? Hmmm, idk. Maybe not in the near future. I'll try other places first before revisiting REX."

Hypes:
- Muffins - hot DAMN, the best blueberry muffin I have ever had in my life. Like every bite you take has at least one or two blueberries in it that are the large, sweet, juicy kinds. Their banana bread is also delicious - i haven't gotten to get past these two sweet things in my mouth to even try to explore others - but I'm sure those are great
- breakfast sandwich - if you're there for breakfast - just get one. its one of the best I've had also. properly cooked egg, with a slightly runny middle, surrounded by a delicious hot sauce, crisp bacon, and perfectly toasted bread. Pricey, may take a little time, but worth it.
- coffee - most places do coffee OR food good, but this does both. get anything. 

Gripes:
- limited seats - those laptop nerds are always in here so its hard to get a seat in here - and they rarely look up for you to get in.
- stairs to get in - hard with a mom and a stroller, but usually you can haggle someone to help you in and out and another person to open the door for you - its actually so good inside its worth the effort. otherwise - id walk the other way..."

and we, mere foot soldiers.
No reservations on a Saturday
for egg sandwiches and pour-overs.

We wandered the streets
the scent of syrup enticing.
But we were met with long lines
or extravagant menu pricing.

We cried maple tears
as our stomachs howled furiously.
We checked Yelp once more,
scrolled desperately and curiously.

""Rex!"" someone exclaimed
""They have a breakfast menu!""
We hurried to our destination
which proved a small but cozy venue.

We ordered cheesy eggs on brioche,
oat milk lattes all around,
sat at one of two communal tables,
happy with this place we had found.

The sandwiches arrived quickly,
and, dear reader, I must pause,
I cannot put into proper words
how good my sandwich was.

Buttery, flakey brioche,
that gooey, salty cheese.
The first bite was pure heaven,
nearly brought me to my knees.

So if you want the perfect breakfast,
skip past those over-hyped places.
Bring your friends to Rex instead
and put egg sandwiches in their faces."
952,rex-new-york-2,2018-07-07,4.0,"Rex is truly a diamond in the rough and I'm so glad I found it. This small, local café has Brooklyn-y vibes and I didn't expect to see a place like it in the middle of Hell's Kitchen. 

I went here for breakfast with a friend on a Saturday morning, and it was a good sign seeing a line formed to the door. I passed on their famous breakfast sandwiches and instead got a yummy vegan date bar, which was delicious. It tasted healthy in the best way possible - super wholesome with lots of oats and other good stuff. Also paired this with a regular iced coffee that tasted amazing. 

The place only has a couple of tables inside so we ended up sitting on the ledge outside (as were some others) - not unexpected for a weekend morning at any place with great food. Definitely worth going here if you're in the area and want a quick coffee or pastry!"
952,rex-new-york-2,2018-11-01,4.0,"We stopped at Rex right after checking into our hotel which was right around the block, and were happy to find it. The line wasn't too significant and we ordered pretty quickly. 

They have a great selection of breakfast sandwiches that all sound super tasty, and it seems like they have regulars in there based on the conversations some of the employees were having while we waited for our food. 

The sandwiches were pretty pricey, but I was really happy with the size of it, so the quality balanced it out well. I would definitely stop at Rex next time I'm in town - as long as I have some extra time because they were pretty busy and the wait time for the sandwich was 10+ minutes. 

The employees were all pretty friendly and the atmosphere was a perfect little coffee shop."
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-01-01,5.0,"I went to Rex because it's near by my boyfriends apartment, and I read the reviews before hand. The food looked delicious and I needed to try it. My boyfriend and I walked 10 blocks to get these breakfast sandwiches and it was well worth it. I got a ham, egg and cheese on a brioche. It was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. Definitely top 5! On the down side, place is super small and they don't have a lot of seating so we had to walk back to enjoy our sandwiches. But it was definitely worth it. Would highly recommend."
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-06-12,5.0,"A delicious, albeit incognito shop. It can be easy to miss if you don't keep your eyes open. Service was fast, cold brew was incredibly tasty. My aunt got a latte and it was very creamy. We came back 2 days in a row and I'd def. hit it up if I were in the area. Solid coffee shop, for sure!"
952,rex-new-york-2,2020-02-02,4.0,A great coffee spot. There isn't always a lot of seating so you typically have to take your beverage to go. The quality of the coffee is really good and the barista's know what they are doing. They even have oat milk and the barista's are talented in creating vegan beverages as well. I find corporate places like Starbucks do not know how to make vegan drinks at all. The food is also good. One star less because it is a little more on the expensive side. But you get what you pay for which is quality.
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-07-04,4.0,"Dropped in on 4th of July. Busy little spot. 
My iced latte left more to be desired but the brioche breakfast sandwich was delicious! 
There are 2 community tables so not ideal for big groups."
952,rex-new-york-2,2020-03-07,1.0,"I've passed this store several times and it always had plenty of people inside so I had been meaning to check it out. I finally went in today excited to try a coffee and breakfast sandwich. I don't usually focus too much on the service but I truly have never felt more unwelcome than by the staff here. When I asked to order a latte I was told that the coffee machine wasn't working, although later while I was eating coffee orders were brought out. In general the staff looked like they resented everyone inside and were pained to be there, looking at their phones and at customers with dead eyes. Truly disappointing experience here."
952,rex-new-york-2,2018-04-12,5.0,"Honestly not much to say that I haven't before. The energy in this place is welcoming, the staff is friendly, service is prompt, and the FOOD IS AMAZING. 

**insert Futurama Fry take all my money meme here**

Here's a tip, skip the breakfast rush but coming in after 10am.... also try the latte with almond milk. 

Cash ams credit happily accepted here. 
Also, plz tip in cash... taxation is robbery."
952,rex-new-york-2,2018-09-30,4.0,"Think this place should come with a warning: waiting for the egg sandwich will take about 30 minutes out of your day. Also, it is hideously expensive, but luckily (?) I've become largely immune to the meaning of money after living here for so long. 

With that said, yes this was Top 3 best egg sandwiches I've ever had. My anger and anxiety that had built up during the wait (my friend and I had an appointment and we were in danger of running late) vanished with the first bite. Not sure how they do it, but they've managed to turn a sausage, egg, croissant sandwich into a True Culinary Experience. 

In addition to that, they also offer a very solid cup of Counter Culture coffee.

Aside from the wait in the very small space, I have no real complaints."
952,rex-new-york-2,2019-12-22,5.0,"Excellent breakfast sandwich. Not cheap, but worth the cost. We got the egg on brioche with ham, broccoli rabe and cheese."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2020-01-25,4.0,"Love this place where you can conveniently pick up high quality cake, pastry, baked goods right before hopping on a train. The photo is a tart I got my fam for New Year's Eve. In addition to the tart, which we devoured, I absolutely LOOOVE their scone - a must try. Their madelines and pain au chocolat are great too. Definitely coming back again!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-11-10,3.0,"I only just realized Financier is named after the French almond cake, not just as a gimmick to attract finance employees (but probably that too).

I've been to Financier at least half a dozen times in the last two months, mainly because my co-workers like the coffee. I think it's a solid place to go when you want a break out of the office, but there's nothing extraordinary. I usually opt for something sweet, so I've tried the palmier, giant hazelnut macaron, chai (go-to drink), and a small cream puff.

They give away a small financier cake with every coffee purchase, which I think is a great treat!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-09-29,4.0,"The goods here are good... the service, not exactly what you expect in a patisserie.

This is a hot lunch spot... everyone has to remember in Manhattan, they deal with a lot of people every day... hundreds.

Customer service is ok... but the quality of the desserts was nice.

I surprised my co-workers with the desserts... they loved them.

The box is pretty and the desserts are just as good... but they fall short of one star because.....you almost fell like the employees want you in and out."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-09-18,4.0,Great coffee.  The croissants are fantastic.  Lines move quickly so don't fret. It's conveniently located next to the subway so it's ideal for a grab and go.
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-07-14,3.0,"3.5! Maybe I'm a bit of a dessert snob but wasn't that impressed. My friend came for dinner and brought 2 desserts for us to try- Chocolate mousse and the ""Opera""... neither were phenomenal but the mousse was good. Wouldn't recommend perhaps their fruit tarts are better? The spot seems hit or miss from the reviews but they are pretty to look at!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2018-12-06,4.0,"This location is teeny weeny, and only has baked goods. But what if I want a Croque Monsieur, sir? No matter, because they have plenty of sweets to tide me over. And with the hustle and bustle of Grand Central foot traffic, I can't see anyone wanting to spend more than 5 minutes in this tiny shop, as they get a lot of spillover patrons rushing through for a pastry and coffee.

Get the Almondine, which is so buttery and sweet! It has a sticky lacquered glaze mixed with sliced almonds, that sit atop a light buttery cake. If you like French madeleines, you'd love these, and I so happen to LOOOVE madeleines. Apple Almond Crumble is quite crumbly indeed and powdery sweet, with nice apple fillings. I'm also a fan of their macarons, which are large but still soft and chewy, with a crisp outer shell. They're not too sweet and have a nice almond aftertaste. Pistachio, chocolate, hazelnut, raspberry are all great flavors. I haven't gotten one that's a dud yet, so that's a plus.

FP is a great pit stop to grab a few items after hopping off or before hopping on the subway or Metro-North. You'll be the envy of every straphanger!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-05-06,5.0,"The only place I  the USA where I have found an attempt at the le Frasier cake & even better that they were almost able to replicate it. I first tasted one at Angelina's in Paris & have been hooked since then! Here they get all the flavors & textures and it turns out to be a delicious treat! It is as good as it gets & I am glad I found a place that makes it. I also tried the jamaican rum cake & it was loaded with rum, it was almost too much but it was still a hit for me. There are plenty of other treats to try & they all look equally delicious!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-04-09,4.0,"Commuting into the city on a weekly basis for interviews, I'm becoming a bit of a Grand Central food offerings connoisseur.

The pastries and coffee here were quality, and they have various cakes, etc. too in case you planned poorly and happen to need a cake for something. This place was busy and they move fast, though, so you'd better be ready with your order.

I tried the apple almond tart and a cafe mocha, both of which I enjoyed. I just wish they were located in the main food court area closer to seating."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2020-01-04,2.0,I got a large cappucino and they gave me a half empty cup...what a ripoff for a five dollar coffee. I would not come back for coffee here again. They only get 2 stars because of their desserts and a free little bite sized bread they give with their coffee.
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-02-10,2.0,"Great location but I wouldn't recommend this place for good quality pastries. 

I got a macaron and a fruit tart. The macaron had a hard texture. The fruit tart was mediocre at best. Overall, I would not return even if I passed."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-09-09,5.0,"I love to stop here when i go through GCS. They make a really nice cappuccino. I have only enjoyed a few of their pastries - macaroons, madeleines,  almond croissants all delicious. 
It is very small but the staff is fast and tries to keep it moving. Only take and go, no where to sit or hang out. French flavor in a new york minute - Bon appetit!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2018-02-14,4.0,"Well, seems like even after a few years, this place is still not getting a whole lotta love! All I can say is that since I started working in the area, this place has been a pretty solid daily stop for coffee and an occasional morning pastry. 

I've tried their blueberry muffins, linzer cookies, chocolate croissants, and napoleons, and all these pastries have been great! Their madeleines are a hit or miss - sometimes they don't taste insanely fresh, but at least they seem to be made correctly. I've tried some other bakeries/coffee shops in the area and their pastries and coffee aren't always so hot either, while the price is comparable. 

The way they bake is pretty authentic to French-style pastries. I had the chance to try their Galettes des Rois and Yule logs over the holidays and found those to be very well-made! I've never experienced any service issues and I love how I can get a smaller cup of coffee here for less than $2 (I don't usually finish a small anyway). 

Overall, I wouldn't make a special trip to come here, but for me it's been a pretty reliable stop for coffee and pastries on the way to work!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2018-12-08,5.0,"Small, Excellent French Bakery in Grand Central Station...
Just had a Croissant and a Drip Coffee but it was superb....Crunchy, Fresh, Beautiful Croissant and perfectly brewed cup of Coffee...
Gotta love it

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-08-09,1.0,Terrible Service! I purchased a Key Lime Meringue and it was thrown into a paper bag ruining the meringue. Very disappointed. As a New Yorker I can say there are plenty of other bakeries that will care about your purchase to package them correctly.
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-11-29,4.0,"I was there yesterday while In NYC. Picture this Thanksgiving Wknd most coffee shops are either closed or a line snaking around the store. All ya want is a bathroom and coffee. I found Grand Central Station by accident. No wait for the ladies bathroom! So I did go to Frankies Hotdog (see separate review). On my way out I just had to stop here even though there are other bakery options in the concourse this one just seem trendy ......I dare say special with their lovely display of pastries. Yes there was a line and the person behind the counter was fast pace - bottom line up front. In no way did I think any of the staff there was rude. Side note- Yorkers aren't rude just direct and I appreciate that. The line was moving quickly - if ya don't know what you want then don't get in line and you won't feel rushed. The display is lovely, my mocha non fat was good but not earth shattering. I ordered 3 macaroons for my daughter. Those suckers were supersized compared to other shops. The free tiny cake was a sweet nice touch but I did order a regular size as well. To me a bit sweet - dang Keto! My daughter ate the macaroons and her opinion is that they were actually too large. Macaroons are normally dainty and the large size of these made it look like a mini burger so she chomped instead of nippled. Sorry no pic she at all 3!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2018-12-06,3.0,"I got the chocolate biscotti, which was good. The chocolate flavor was there, but you could tell it was mostly present with cacao powder instead of straight-up chocolate. Maybe it's because I waited to eat it after a 15 minute hike in human NYC weather to get home, but it wasn't very crunchy and was a bit moist. It may also be because I bought the biscotti 30 minutes before closing - I'd imagine they wouldn't be churning out fresh biscotti at a time like that. 
The place is located within Grand Central, and come early because they seem to run out of stuff pretty quickly. Personally, I like Maison Kayser, but considering the locational convenience here, it may be preferable for others."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2018-12-22,5.0,"Excellent bakery inside grand central right by the subway entrance. It's a decent sized chain in the city. Their baked goods and cakes are pretty reasonably priced for midtown. They also offer free engraving for cakes which you can order online unlike other bakeries that charge $$ (for example, magnolia). 

Their coffees are okay. But the mini cakes and all baked goods are fantastic. Their pies and cakes are amazing. They offer seasonal cakes and pies like buche noel which is extremely moist but sweet. My favorite is the cake with pistachio cream."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-11-26,1.0,"Honestly this place has good coffee and good bakeries but the people that work there are terrible. To be specific, I went there yesterday and ordered an iced mocha and a hot mocha came out. That's fine, we all make mistakes I kindly told the people that made it I wanted iced mocha. And I'm certain I said iced but the guy that took my order came back to say to me that I didn't say iced and that I only said Mocha. Fine so what if I just said Mocha. Should you assume that it is hot and get mad at your customer because you assumed wrong? Unbelievable. I will never go back there. It is so unfortunate since I love the pastries."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-07-06,5.0,"Lovely service, fast orders. I always get the iced coffee (tip - ask for extra ice because I find they put too little sometimes) and it comes with a small madeleine."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2018-04-23,4.0,"4 Stars for a fabulously buttery plain croissant and some other treats (that would have done well with a quick moment in a heater) in Grand Central Station.

This bakery is located just inside some of the doors to Grand Central Station and the line will draw you in. I saw signage on the dessert display that mentioned they had won best croissant somewhere, so I knew I'd be getting a plain one right away. We also ordered a ham and cheese croissant and a quiche. 

The service was meh. Not great, not a smile or greeting, but not horrible by any means. I do wish they'd warmed things up, but they bagged them up for us cold. 

In terms of the food-- Definitely get the plain croissant. It is buttery to an extreme and I wasn't complaining. It also flakes just the way you'd want. The ham and cheese croissant was reheated and eaten the next day and it held up perfectly. 

The only bummer in terms of food was the mini quiche. It was ok. Not remarkable. I imagine if it had been heated up slightly it could have been better. But, as it was, it was the least memorable part of the lunch. 

Anyway, it is a simple bakery at the train station, but is it greeeeeat? Naw. But it's good :)"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-01-01,2.0,"Came here for a croissant break
while it wasn't the best, not a mistake.
It was quite greasy, but had good flake.
Flavorless, like the butter is fake?

The financier gave this place its name
but sadly my experience was the same.
The almond flavor that brought it to fame
burned as brightly as a toothpick flame."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2016-11-16,4.0,"Financier Patisserie became an instant favorite spot of mine, ever since I started working here about a year and a half here. I was always so attracted to the bright green décor. Their cake in the display window always look delicious and ready to be picked up by anyone at any given time. Not to mention, many cakes were bought here for my office birthday celebrations. It is conveniently located within the terminal for commuters, too! 

I am a fan of their fresh coffee and baked goods in the morning. Every cup of coffee you purchase, you get a mini madeleine. It is a very nice treat to have. Great black coffee with a sweet little treat to go with it. Croissants are so buttery and flakey here. My favorite is the almond croissant which has a nice flakey exterior and smooth almond paste inside. Cookies here are also super soft and chewy texture. Freshly baked every morning and sells out before the afternoon rush hour! 

I arrive at the terminal usually by 7:15 am every morning and there is a line formed within this small shop but it goes super quick. They always have someone behind the counter to take your pastry and coffee orders. By the time you reach the cashier, all you need to do pay. Super friendly and efficient customer service!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-01-26,1.0,"Bought the cream and strawberries cake on my way home from this bakery and the cream had actually gone bad. As soon as we took a bite of the cake we realized something was off and after several people tasting it we confirmed the cream was stale/curdled. What a terrible way to ruin someone's birthday!

Will definitely be avoiding this store in the future."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2016-09-09,5.0,"I love this brand! Financier was my go-to cafe, coffee, pastry treats while working in FiDi.  All the locations are consistent with their delicious pastries, cakes, macarons, and especially their ""Madeleine"" - soft, not overly sweet, decadent and totally my kind of freebie (a mini version is given w/ a coffee purchase!).

My favorites - almond croissant, almond brioche, vanilla latte (they use illy product!), and macarons.  Never had lunch here but I have seen their salads and it looks good. 

Service is always friendly & if you come by often, your barista will know your drink of choice. ;)

Have a yummy treat!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2018-08-31,5.0,"For me, it's all about the macarons here, and then the croissants. The macaroons are all sorts of delicious creative flavors, including Banana Caramel and Cassis. The shop is a small space to maneuver, but if you know what you want to get like me, then it's easy to pop in and you're out quick enough. The subway entrance is right next to the store, as is the exit to the street, so you can be on your way in yummy flash. The plain croissants are buttery and flaky, and always delicious. Enjoy!"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2019-11-09,2.0,"The place is not very hygienic as you can see small houseflies hovering over the bakery items. I brought this to the attention of server/store personnel who was behind the payment counter, and told him to tell the management to place the food items in a glass box or something like that to prevent flies from getting in contact with the food, but instead of acknowledging my concern he brushed it aside saying that he cannot do anything about it.  Management officials, if you are reading this review then please take proper health and safety steps at this particular store . The products usually taste good but if basic hygiene standards are overlooked then it is a serious health violation.
Now as for the food, I got a chocolate croissant . It was average in taste. Quite cold and they didnt warm it up before giving it to me. 
Last but not the least, please teach your staff to not act cranky and be blatantly disrespectful to the customers who provide constructive feedback about healthcare violations. Whosoever was on duty at 12:50 pm on 9th November at the GC location of this store needs to be re-trained in the art of talking to customers and addressing their grievances"
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2016-03-22,4.0,"I walk from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to my offices on the east side of town in the morning and sometimes I stop at Financier Patisserie to get a treat to share at the office. The Grand Central Terminal is convenient for me on my path even though I may have to go against the herds of people leaving the terminal to get to the Financier Patisserie café,  because it on the inside the terminal with no access from the cafe. The other Financier Patisserie cafes in the area are out of the way for me.

The staff never get annoyed having me just standing there staring and taking photos at all the delicious cakes, mousse, cookies, macarons, and other deserts treats. I usually settle for the small pack of  Palmier cookies @ about $6.00 in the morning. I loved their light crispy layers and sweet outside sugar coating. They are small  and about 20 to container which is a clear cylindrical package. I and some of my sweet tooth coworkers will have some with our teas and coffee in the morning, and somethings we still have a few left over to have after lunch. 

I like the Palmier more than the Chocolate, Coconut or Diamond cookies.  I have not tried their coffee or macarons and getting a cake or other rich desert in the morning would be little too much, But I did try the Black and White cake on another occasion which I found to taste real good. I would say they are a notch below Maison Keyser which has similar French style offerings but a notch above Paris Baguette in richness."

When I'm in Grand Central, there's one stop on my to-do list before I hop on the Metro North heading home. Financier is filled with all sorts of sweets. Apple pie, apple turnovers and cheese danishes are prepared with a French flair. Their chocolate pastries is what wins me over.

Really like the true, French Café style they go for, with hexagon floor tiles and light yellow walls. (Light green and white stripes are their signature color statement). Presentation of all their Pastries, are displayed very neatly. 

The few times I've been to this location, staff has been a uneven. I've gotten either pleasant, or the rude employee. Sometimes, they're in tip top shape, other times, they lag. They just need to tweak and check their attitudes. Other than the unpleasantries, Pastries have been very good."

The staff has an attitude and I've actually heard the woman who I believe is the manager in the mornings making comments to the staff about customers.

my pregnant wife crave for some sweet tonight, so as I am on my way home after work today.  I stop by Grand Central's Financier Patisserie, pick up a croissant and a berry tart. 

we live in queens and taks only 40mins ride home, at home she ate half of the tart and I finished the croissant, 15 mins later, she was having severe stomach cramp, we got scare and called our OB and was preparing sending her to ER, Our OB told us her symptoms not likely related to the baby and we should wait a bit before we go to ER, 10mins later she was able to throw up and felt slight better, we still was not sure it was from the tart, so hour later I eat a quarter of it, sure enough, I experice the same stomach cramp (bit milder) and have to throw up too. 

In my 25 years in NYC, growing up in Brooklyn. live in Queens, work in Midtown. I had never got food poison from a Bakery, not even from the small store in the neighborhood. this is a lesson learned. Stay far away from this bakery at all cost, I reported to 311 and hope no more people get sick from this place!."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2018-03-09,3.0,"Great pastries but awful customer service, year after year. I love the quality, inventiveness, and flavors of many Financier Patisserie desserts. We've sampled a variety of their baked good, pastries, and cakes over the years. One somewhat hidden the gem is the Sacher Torte cake they occasionally have. It's fabulous. Their (off-site) bakers are finely skilled, in my opinion. The only menu item I don't like from Financier is probably their macarons. But virtually everything else that my family and I have tried from here has been very good. 

Why the 3-start review then? That's because customer service at the GCT location is consistently 1-2 stars, at best. We've frequented this location for years, and customer service has always been borderline rude and incompetent. It's always over-staffed, with employees joking around with each other, but showing a lack of interest in the customers and a lack of knowledge about the product. It's totally off-putting to encounter this sort of attitude at what's supposed to be a fine bakery. Can't the management train the employees better and demand more courteous service from them? For shame."

My only problem with the place is they are not filling up the coffee cups all the way up and regular customers started to raise their voices about that. Every morning I am seeing people talking about this, opening the lids and showing the amount of coffee to them or to their friends. I hope they are not trying to steal from their customers and hope this is not intentional. If any Manager reading this, please respond us and let us know if this is going to be resolved or not.

The bad part, their expensive! Three bucks a pop for these tiny things.  Look like lil Debbie creme pies so I thought the price would be similar lol 

Everything in this small place is expensive but it's a French bakery so is expect it to be otherwise I'd go to the hood spot to get me an empanada and Dominican cake.

Sat down with 2 friends as we were looking for a cafe to work from.
A friend and I sat down to check if there was wifi while another friend went to buy a coffee.

The manager (whose name, I believe, is Mark) immediately approached us the moment we sat down and said ""You can't stay here for free, you know. Are you going to buy something"". We replied ""Yes, we will"", which would normally suffice as an answer in any respectable establishment. He instead replied with ""When? When are you going to buy something?""

Mark, the manager, ruined the experience for us.

I will most certainly not return, but if I do, I hope you remember how rude you were to a group of three that literally just sat down."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2017-02-10,3.0,"I accidentally walked into Financier Patisserie inside Grand Central when looking for something after class late in the evening. 

They were almost closed then so all beverages were not available except hot coffee and tea. I had a cup of chamonmile tea and a Pistachio Cranberry Eclair. I was waiting for my drink when I walked around and spotted the glass display cabin with all these gorgeous looking cakes. I ended up buying an assorted box of 16 samples which looked so cute. I wasn't impressed with the eclair cause the pistachio cream tasted a bit like cherry, which I really hate. I tried a couple of cakes in the assorted box and it was pretty good. The Chocolate Opera and Tiramisu was very chocolaty riched. However I still ended up throwing away some of the samples after a few days lol. 

The girl who checked out for that day was kind of impolite. She looked really tired tho so I'm not blaming her. Just an average bakery."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2014-11-07,3.0,"This location at the Grand Central Terminal is convenient for me to grab desserts or cakes here as it is near the subway and trains. Have gotten the macarons for $2.25 each and thought they were only okay - not enough filling. 

However, I have tried many Financier Patisserie cakes for various friends' birthdays and they were all very delicious. My favorites include the White and Black Chocolate Mousse and the Tiramisu Cake - both rich and decadent without being overly sweet. The texture of the cake is so smooth. I am a big fan of mousse cakes and have tried a lot from different bakeries back in DC. I have to say the mousse cakes at Financier Patisserie is definitely at the top of some of the best mousse cakes that I've had. The cakes are also more reasonably priced (~$40 for a 9' cake) than other bakeries in the city. 

Ordering or decorating cakes here prove to be a hassle and I have found the customer service to be slightly rude. If you want to buy a whole cake at the bakery, they will not write any additional wording on the cake - you have to inform them at least a day in advance. They only have 7' cakes in stores - which is on the smaller side. If you want the cake in a larger size - you need to pre-order in advance 72 hours before. They have also ran out of cakes on display in the afternoon on the weekends. This is not a good last minute option if you are looking for a meaningful cake."
953,financier-patisserie-new-york-33,2016-12-07,3.0,"I came here for coffee break from work on a Thursday afternoon. My coworker recommended this place because you get a free madeleine cake for every coffee you purchase and I was really in the mood for something sweet. 

I got a small cappuccino, which was only alright. The flavor was not as rich as I'd like it to be and was quite acidic in my opinion. The coffee was quite expensive too. For the price of a small cappuccino, I could've gotten 3 big madeleine cakes. But to be fair, their small size was bigger than usual. 

On another note, their pastries and cakes look amazing! Unfortunately, my review is only based on the coffee but this place is probably more well known for its cakes than its coffee."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2020-01-03,5.0,"I consistently experience good food, drinks, and service here. My future mother-in-law comes here often, and has been doing so for years. I have been coming with her several times a year for the last few years. 

There is always a dish that can be done vegan (perfect for me!), most recently the wonderful cauliflower dish that blows me away with flavor each and every time. Wonderful! 

Staff members have always been pleasant, informative, and attentive. The restaurant and tables itself are always clean and well-kept. 

It is imperative to remember that coming here is to be an enjoyable food and social experience, do not come here if you are on a timeline. It is best enjoyed relaxed, as service may not always be prompt, however, this allows for socializing and catching up, so I prefer this! 

The wine list is plentiful (with a fabulous brut rosé), the menu is as well, boasting many entree choices for others who dine with me that are not vegans. 

We surely will return, we always do, and I effortlessly recommend this for your dining experience while out shopping around as well."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2020-02-24,3.0,"I think Yelp should update the number of dollar signs to 4 and not 3. This was really expensive AND for the size of the portions ... felt like I got ripped off. $18-$25 for a house glass of wine. 3 adults mostly going for few appetizers and 1-2 main courses plus 3 glasses of wine ... $400 including tip. Painful. But hey, service was very good.

Duck dumplings were very good. Crab Cake salad was very good. Humus (Mediterranean platter) was a joke at something like $24.

I will be very careful gong forward with the dollar signs Yelp displays. Should always look at the menu."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2020-01-01,1.0,"My fiancé and I came here on Dec 4th while scouting out post wedding brunch spots and as a nice lunch before a show. Over all the experience seemed fine. Until it was time to get the check, we spent 45mins trying to catch anyone's attention. When we finally did it was too late, by the time we got there we had missed the beginning of the play. 

I wish I could say that was the worst part of our experience. Unfortunately it wasn't. Turns out it was a good thing we didn't make it into the play because we both came down with SEVERE food poisoning. We both had to call out of work the next day and remained very ill for days. I told my fiancé to call the restaurant to let them know they were serving contaminated food (either the lobster bisque or the deviled eggs, the only food we shared) and was met with a dismissive and defensive staff. I'm not sure if they thought we were looking for some kind of compensation but BG can rest assured that there is no amount of money on earth that could make me eat anything that ever comes out of that kitchen again. Furthermore my fiancé was told a manager would reach out to him but no one ever did. 

Eat at your own risk, this restaurant doesn't seem to care much for the health and safety of their guests. I am a chef and was hoping BG would take this as seriously as we would in my kitchen."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-12-27,4.0,"Loved the food at Bergdorf Goodman's restaurant on the top floor.

Duck Dumplings
We started with the duck dumplings, which were really juicy!  Great way to wet the appetite while you're waiting for the main!  

Cauliflower Steak
Sadly, they ran out of the lentil soup, which was my first choice, so I settled on the cauliflower steak. The curry sauce that came with it was really flavorful, but to be honest, I was a bit disappointed in that it was a giant slab of cauliflower and broccoli.  They didn't really do anything special with the veggies themselves.  My rule about food is that if I can make it at home, I don't want to order it out.  And this felt like something I could have made myself.  I'll try something else next time.

Lobster Napoleon
My friend always gets lobster napoleon, which was amazing!  Really creamy and rich.  I was definitely jealous at her order.

Lemon Meringue
We also ordered lemon meringue for dessert, which was delightfully refreshing after a big meal.  It came with some berry coulis.  Yum!  It went well with a pot of tea, on my end.  Perfect way to end the meal!

Reservations
It's hard to get in, so make reservations way in advance, particularly around the holidays!  

Ambiance
We were seated by a window and enjoyed a view of Central Park.  It's nice and light in there, with big windows, so you can look out.  It's a bit loud, but given how many people were in there, we could still hear each other.

Service
We had attentive service and our server checked in just enough, but left us alone to catch up.

Final Verdict
Definitely a treat, and well worth the expense.  Great for catching up with your girlfriends or a romantic date.  I will definitely be back again!"
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-11-17,3.0,"It's of a different era, and not in any way a good way. The off-pastel colors gave the decor a sad-hospital-esque feel. 

Before we entered, it was craaaazy crowded and packed which the space doesn't lend itself well to deal with. I'm sure that means all is is good for them, but squeezing between people and tables meant you can't really enjoy anything about the room or the view.

So the four of us sat, told our server we were here for tea and did the whole thing - chose our tea, wanted more snacks, ordered lunch too because I didn't eat lunch at it was like 2p. And...I mean, it seems like such a sterotype but do women who come here not eat? We said we wanted to add an extra order of cookies to our tray and he was like ""are you sure? It already comes with a lot."" So we asked him what it comes with and he names two things. We were ALL expecting him to list at least 4 things...so yea. Definitely more cookies please.

When the tea arrived, I knew something was off. I got a whiff of my friend's and I knew that one was meant to be mine. Thankfully two of them ordered the same thing, so by process of elimination, we figured out they were all rotated one off. 

The savory items were good, but most of the sweets were questionable. Like the cute cookie that has BG on it was completely flavorless. And the macaroons...I don't know what else to say other than disappointing.

Positive points: server was nice (other than suggesting girls don't eat) and we stayed around 2.5 hours chatting away and they didn't hassle us or anything.

All in all, glad I came here for the experience to say I've done it, but there's better afternoon teaing to be had in the city."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-11-24,5.0,"Went to BG Restaurant for afternoon tea on Sunday around 3pm, and it was an absolute delight! It was our first time there (party of 2), and we ordered a set for each of us. 

From the beginning, we were welcomed kindly -- Ismael took our coats and showed us to our seats, where we were promptly given menus. The afternoon tea set allows you to choose a pot of tea; we went for the Jardin Bleu and the Nuit en Versailles (fruity), both were great but I preferred the latter! The sandwiches and desserts were great, some were alright/good and others were excellent. We especially loved the clotted cream and scones, which were adorable.

All in all, we stayed there for 2 hours and were so full we didn't go for dinner (we had a late lunch). We had a great view of Central Park, and were so glad that we spent our afternoon here. Will definitely be back!"

We went for Sunday afternoon tea and had a 3pm seating for 4 people 

We arrived a minute or two early and they promptly greeted us and took us to our table. We were fortunate to have a window table on a fall weekend when the nyc marathon was going on 

Wonderful service from white jacketed professionals for the entire event. They served the tea and champagne very quickly followed by the towers of sandwiches and sweets 

I highly recommend!"
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2020-01-13,5.0,This was a lovely experience. Our waiter was fantastic. The food was excellent. The atmosphere is wonderful. Definitely worth coming here when visiting the store. We loved every minute.
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2020-01-28,5.0,"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for 2 years. I finally made it here for afternoon tea. Reservations is a must. We still had to wait but it was worth it. Great service, food and great views of Central Park. Manager was friendly. I enjoyed myself. Everyone must try this place at least once in their lifetime."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2020-01-01,3.0,"Made a second visit to BG for afternoon tea, four years after my first. I can't tell if it's gotten worse in quality, or I've just realized what a not-great deal it is.

Here are the pros - The reservations are very easy to get even just a few days in advance. The price point is on the lower side for afternoon tea in NYC ($45pp versus $60+ that you'd find elsewhere). It's a nice place to take visiting friends/family because of the location, and you might get seated by the windows that offer a Central Park view (we didn't).

But here are the overwhelming cons that make this a not-recommended spot for tea:
- The portions are very small. I usually come out of afternoon tea completely filled to the brim but you won't get full here. You only get 1 small scone per person, which comes with butter (it was partially melted - you cannot convince me this was proper Devonshire or clotted cream) and jarred honey and jam (not fresh fruit preserves - you can find Bonne Maman jam at any supermarket). There were 5 TINY savory sandwiches (the cucumber sandwich was literally ONE cucumber slice).
- The tea selection is very bad. There is only a list of ~10 to choose from, and none of them were particularly high quality. The majority were fruit infused teas, and all of them were just mixes from different regions. We tried the Anji (white tea) and the Earl Grey and both were meh.
- The petit fours were all way too sweet. There wasn't much variety in texture/flavor.
- Service was just fine, but not great (needed to ask for things twice)."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-04-16,4.0,"Afternoon tea at Bergdorf's was a classy and delightful affair! On the 7th floor, this restaurant is amidst beautiful rooms, furniture, home goods, flower arrangements, bridal suite, perfumes, teas, chocolates and other treats. 

There were no window seats open when my friend and I arrived, but they seated us in blue whisper chairs in the center of the main dining area. The decor was lovely and modern with cream colored walls and unique designs in the front then pale blue floral wall paper where we were. Very elegant and posh ambiance. 

The price of the afternoon tea service is $45 per person, which I thought was reasonable, especially for such a high end place. If you want to get even fancier, the Tea Service Royale includes Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label Brut and is $62 per person. 

There were 10 different teas to select from and I ordered the Jardin Bleu (which was recommended). It was a blend of teas from China and India, with notes of rhubarb, wild strawberry and cornflower petals. I enjoyed this aromatic and sweet tea with a touch of milk - I didn't need to add sugar. 

The 3 tiered plate for the afternoon plate was quite impressive and everything looked absolutely wonderful! There were 5 types of finger sandwiches, scones served with fruit preserves and Devonshire cream, macarons, lemon tarts, chocolate cake, chocolates and cookies. 

My top favorite sandwiches were the truffle chicken and ham with brie. The truffle one was amazing and had such a potent truffle flavor. I can never get enough truffle! The ham and brie one had plenty of both ingredients and was hearty with a yummy tasting sauce. Then there was an egg salad sandwich which was pretty good. Surprisingly, I thought the smoked salmon, marbled with cheese, topped with caviar was decent. Usually I am not a fan of either smoked salmon or cavair. The cream cheese and cucumber one was just okay. I was impressed and happy about the touches of aristocratic ingredients used in the sandwiches.

The scones were freshly baked and had visible bits of apricot and berries throughout. They were still warm, very moist, perfectly crumbly and that Devonshire cream was divine - Rich, thick, smooth. Combined with the strawberry or apricot preserve jam, it made for a real treat.

All the desserts were so delicious! The multi layered chocolate cake was intensely chocolate-y and the cake itself was so soft and fluffy. There were also these little cakes: One was covered with expresso and the other had vanilla. Both were little bites of heaven. The sugar cookies were sweet and crunchy. The lemon tarts with raspberries were definitely tart, yet refreshing. I think the ones I liked the least were the macarons (strawberry one and a coffee one) because I have high standards when it comes to macarons. They were nicely flaky and chewy though.

Service was pleasant throughout. Our waitress was on top if it. She gave a description of what was on the plates when she brought it out to us and she made sure to refill our tea pots with hot water. Toward the end, she let us know that it was the end of our shift and the following waiter was nice but it took him awhile to provide us with the bill. Overall, a grand experience and way to spend the afternoon. As an added bonus, this afternoon tea will actually satisfy your appetite!"
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-11-18,5.0,"We had a fabulous experience here for afternoon tea. We made a reservation about a month in advance, which I recommend. Our server was amazing, he was so friendly and made great tea recommendations. Our tea and food came out very quickly. At first we were afraid we'd be rushed but we truly weren't. It was a very lovely, relaxing experience. The food was delicious and it's a lot more than you'd expect! You won't leave hungry. Totally recommend!"
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-09-06,3.0,"An afternoon tea experience that was just OK. BG restaurant has tables for afternoon tea every day from 3-5. I made a reservation for 2:45 for my sister and I and put in a request for a table by the windows and the whispering chairs. When we got there, we were happy to see that they honored our request. To enter, you go into Bergdorf Goodman and take the elevators at the back of the store up to the 6th floor. Once we were seated, our waiter promptly provided us with the afternoon tea menus and we chose our teas- the jardin bleu for me and the anji for my sister. The waiter brought out our teas and I was pleased with my choice, it was fruity, floral, and flavorful. The anji was good but nothing special. The tea pots were a decent size, we each got 3-4 cups out of them. However, my sister's cup was dirty. We tried to flag down the waiter but it took a while before we got his attention and by then my sister was already upset. It's frustrating to have to ask them to replace your cup because it's a little awkward to point out that it is dirty, and I wish that we hadn't been put in that position in the first place. 

This little hiccup did dampen the rest of our experience a little, but when the food tower arrived, both of us were happier. The scones were homemade and warm. They were quite delicious and moist, especially with the little jars of Bonne Maman jam and cream. The cream's consistency was hard, more like butter, so I think this can definitely be improved. The sandwiches were decent, some better than others. Our favorites were the truffled chicken salad and ham and brie with dijon. There was also a salmon and cream cheese one and a cucumber-dill-cream cheese one that were fine. The egg salad was the least impressive (mainly because I dislike egg and my sister had to eat them). The dessert tier had a variety of tiny pastries and cookies. There were 2 macarons (raspberry and pistachio), 2 mocha-chocolate cakes, 2 lemon meringue tarts, and 2 decorated sugar cookies. These desserts were TINY! The macarons were the biggest items on the plate, to give you a sense of proportions. However, we were still extremely full when we got to the dessert tier and could barely eat them all. The ones we did eat were very average.

The check came with 2 Andes mint chocolates which was a nice touch. Overall, BG restaurant has a decent afternoon tea service, but you'll likely have a better experience somewhere else. I was unimpressed considering the price we paid ($45 each not including tip + tax). BG is probably middle-tier for afternoon tea options in NYC, and I think I'd rather shell out some more $$ for a superior experience or keep it simple at a more affordable restaurant with lower expectations."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-01-02,5.0,"Delicious pastries and scones for the afternoon tea! It was packed on a Monday afternoon so definitely get reservations. 

We ordered tea for 2 plus lobster Mac n cheese from the regular menu and shared between 3 people. We especially loved the curry chicken sandwich and the lemon tart. The Mac n cheese was to die for and definitely the best part of the meal. Great service too!"

954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2018-12-19,5.0,"My cousin had a reservation for a Tuesday lunch at 1:30p. When we arrived, it was packed! Other impromptu guests were told there was an hour wait, so it's a good idea to make a reservation even if you think you're going at a less busy time. Get the seats by the window if you can for Central Park views!

It's classy, elegant & posh. The waiting staff are very polite, patient & courteous with a smile. You feel like royalty. Everything is of quality here from the decor to the linens to the table settings, handmade modern art cups to the food, of course!

We started off with eggnog & a friend got the cider which were on point with the spike ;) For starters, I got the seared diver scallops which was amazing. The scallops were seared so nicely, toasty on the edges but once in your mouth they melt. Seasoned great. They sat on top of ravioli with ricotta & asparagus with a white truffle sauce & sliced truffle. I don't like overpowering truffle & these ravioli were well balanced. Every bite was delectable, I should have made this my entree which you have the option to.

Cousin got the lobster salad which is a layered tower. It was presented lovely & very fresh. She also got the lobster Mac N Cheese which came in a small looking ramekin & tasted like penne vodka with lobster... I still liked it very much though.

The lobster napoleon was my cousin's entree & I would have to order that next time! Lobster & pasta tossed in a creamy truffle sauce... wow. I got the seafood gnocchi which had lobster & shrimp in a cherry tomato sauce. The tomato sauce is very fresh & light. The gnocchi is what I enjoyed most which were soft & tasty. They are very filling. To be honest though, I do prefer either the seared scallops & the lobster Napoleon over this dish.

And lastly, we had the pumpkin cheesecake to share. Unbelievable, in the way it was not like other heavy cream cheesed cheesecakes, this was baked had a nice toasted top... and when your utensil cuts through you could feel & see the softness & creaminess of the cake. You could taste the pumpkin & feel it melt in your mouth. My favorite cheesecake ever, I believe. This was an amazing dining experience, what a meal!"
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-10-08,5.0,"There's something to be said about a great bartender and even better service. I was in the city alone for business and wanted to take a half an afternoon to have a nice lunch and glass of wine with a great view, and do some shopping. Going to Bergdorf's was something of a treat for myself, although I'm not really averse to nice restaurants and shopping. But I am from the Midwest and we spend our money differently and more discriminately here. That being said I feel like every penny of the $75 lunch I had at BG's was worth it. Mostly in part due to the impeccable service by Nick the bartender. 

I arrived alone there was no table for me so I gladly took a seat at the bar. Not only were Nick's recommendations spot on..He had an effortless way about him that suggested he genuinely cared about his position and cared about the experience that the diners had. I don't care who you are, as a person who is also in the service industry, too often people forget that we are of service to other people. When we do it we take pride in it. People like Nick are hard to find these days. BG would do well to acknowledge and reward this type of service. The food was exceptional by the way, the view and ambiance kind of great.. and literally made my afternoon perfect. Stress free, engaging and professional staff ( even the guy with the man bun with a questionable affinity for mustard in his tuna sandwiches :). Will definitely be back every time I'm in the city."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-12-09,3.0,"Beware that you absolutely need to make reservations before coming here. At 4:00 pm on a Sunday, my mother and I wanted to try the tea time package. We waited a good 45 minutes to be seated at the bar. They served tea there but the bartender (who was just covering for the day) wasn't certain whether they served tea there. We ended up not getting the tea package which is $50 bucks a person for petite fours and crumpets. Instead, we had a cappuccino and regular tea with cheesecake and Christmas cookies. We really just wanted a desert. The venue is beautiful and elegant. But it also packed with rich holiday shoppers with an entitled sense of self. The bartender was very friendly and really made an effort to be friendly. The food was good. I would have given this place more stars if the wait wasn't so long and if items came out faster. But all in all, this is an iconic restaurant in a fancy department store."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-12-28,4.0,"This is such an iconic place to have lunch and if you are lucky, you will have the view of Central Park while dining. I've been here numerous of time as a child, as a student in college, and now as a working adult. The service has not been an issue and they are able to calmly and confidently solve issues with their patrons. The only issue I had was the algorithm on their Open Table app. The app should be updated because they accept more reservations than they can during peak hours. I had a reservation with my mother and still waited 35 min since people were taking longer than expected to finish their lunch. 
It was a nice touch they gave us free champagne for waiting the extra allotted time to finally sit at our table."

954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-05-07,5.0,"This is a must do in New York. Tea time at Bergdorf Goodman is 3-5 every day. We had a reservation and I would highly recommend also getting one. Many people tried to be seated while we dined and a reservation just makes it easier to have a sure spot. 

The views are phenomenal and the food is amazing. I went with my mother and sister and we had the tea as our lunch and were still full for the rest of the day. 

For the tea, you are not only paying for the food but also the experience. Major gossip girl vibes. I hope to be able to go again."

They knew it was for a celebration- gave us the premiere view of Central Park! I wasn't expecting that & it all aligned thank you Universe.

We got the Roobios, Jarling, & Green tea. You choose one per person. It's different than high tea in London where you get to try as many as you like--still superb.

Scones were on point along with butter & preserves. They even gave a complimentary dessert  Very relaxing & you don't necessarily need to dress all fancy. We were sat right when my reservation was made--highly recommend reservations"
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-04-07,4.0,"High tea vs. Afternoon tea? I've never known the difference until now, but after being corrected by the hostess (several times), I looked it up...and from this moment on, will use the term afternoon tea instead. 

Tip #1: Head up to the 7th floor to reach the restaurant (there are no signs anywhere), in case you're not familiar with the store. 

Tip #2: Try to get seated by the window, because the view is worth it. 

Tip #3: Get the Jardin Bleu tea, our server recommended it and he was right! Note that there isn't warmer to keep the tea warm the entire time, BUT they will come by with more hot water. 

...and last, but not least, the food. The sandwiches were all very very good and the desserts were also really really delicious. We also ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese (do not skip this) and they graciously split it between two dishes for us (thank you!). It took restraint not to order more scones!!

The ambiance is lovely and the service is great. I will definitely return!"
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2018-08-19,3.0,"I enjoy going to afternoon tea.

Service: We were running late for our afternoon tea reservation so I called ahead to put them on notice. Shirley, was a hotess I spoke with politely adjusted our reservation and  let me know she would alert the team. Isaura was our server. She was pleasant and attentive.

Tea Selection: For the tea selection, I had the Citrus roibis tea. Mom had the Peppermint and sis had the Jardin Blue. We each were able to refill our cups three to four times. Now, when one goes to TEA, you expect great quality tea. Unfortunately, my tea was just ok. I expected to enjoy a higher quality, stronger tasting tea from an establishment such as BG.

While we waited --- which was a pretty long wait in my opinion --about 20 mins after the tea arrived for the tower of sandwiches and treats arrived. During this time, I observed that the staff changed the table cloth after each guest left, a signal of fine dining which is admirable, but expensive to maintain no? (I suggest putting some nice glass over those tablecloths and call it a day).

The seating along the wall were quite close together but we made it work and I was able to take in the view of Central Park in the background.

Sandwiches: My personal fave was the Salmon caviar,  then the Brie without the ham, third was the egg sandwhich, and rounding out the list was the cucumber dill.

Scones with the Devonshire cream were solid. 

Assorted Sweet treats ranked from best to least appetizing: Strawberry layered treat, pistachio macaroon, vanilla macaroon, chocolate coffee cake, lemon meringue, tiramisu, and a mini sugar cookie . 

I must say:
First, I expected the restaurant to be a bit more opulent than it was. It may be because I could tell the signature green chairs and sky blue leather seats were a bit worn. The wallpaper and light fixtures were beautiful to look at. Plus, the baby blue Versailles chairs were very elegant, lavish, and quite perfect for a Instagram photo op, which I definitely took advantage of.- But it may be time for a makeover BG.

Second: I understand that prices have gone up in the city, but I have also noticed that the portion sizes of the sandwiches have gotten smaller compared to the presentation of pictures from prior years provided by yelpers. I don't have an issue paying for quality as I thoroughly think these sandwiches were better in taste and freshness than Lady Mendel's Tea Salon but the portions were smaller than a generous tea experience from Alice's Tea Cup."

954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2020-01-01,4.0,"It was my first time here and I enjoyed it. However, I will probably only visit again with my friends since it cost $49 per person. The food they had were very interesting, such as the sandwiches, deserts, and other items. They had a variety of tea to choose from, and it was good. We visited during the holiday season and the place was packed, but I do not know how it is on a normal day. Either way, make sure to have a reservation to be safe."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-11-01,4.0,Great high tea spot in the city. Got a window seat with Central Park view. Price is reliability decent compared to other afternoon tea places in Manhattan.
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2018-12-06,4.0,Make a reservation for afternoon tea. With a reservation they will seat you in those big blue chairs by the wall which is 80% of the royal treatment instead of the tiny tables in the center aisle. Everything in the tea set is tasty and it is a lot of food. I dressed up for the occasion but didn't feel quite as elegant after I stuffed my face and cleared my plate. One of the best value high tea experiences in the city.

I definitely wouldn't call it the healthiest meal, but there is a bed of lettuce under all the deliciousness!"

This was my first time here and now my last. 
Almost half way though my soup today I found a piece of a foil sleeve protector used to cover wine bottles in my soup. 
I should of taken a picture but this review will do. Thank god I didn't bite down on it as this would of caused some tooth pain. It was the length of a quarter and bent like a boomerang. 
MANAGEMENT!!..take note and monitor service in the kitchen. This is a BIG red flag!! What else might end up in people's food.
This is extremely *disappointing and *disgusting."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-03-02,4.0,"I've been to two other high teas in the city and have to say this one has the most beautiful room! It's pretty on par price wise with most others. The classic high tea is $45 while the one with champagne is $62. We went for the one with champagne. In general you get all the same things you get at any tea; scones, sandwiches, and some sweets along with a pot of tea and endless hot water. The only thing I'll say bergdorf doesn't have are some form of heater to sit under the teapot to keep it warm. It did generally stay warm on its own though, so not a major issue. This was also one of the more crowded high teas I've been to but we were still able to carry on a reasonable conversation. Everyone who worked there was also incredibly kind and down to earth, it's not a snobby atmosphere at all."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-09-07,5.0,Stopped by BG for dessert and a cocktail... We dined at the bar where we received friendly service from our cool bartender named Nick. The Aperol Spritz I ordered was made just right and our bartender recommended the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert and we were very happy with the choice!! BG has a beautiful atmosphere with breathtaking views of Central Park & definitely good people watching.
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-12-10,5.0,"Having afternoon tea in NYC was on my bucket list so when I recently had the opportunity to visit my daughter who works in NYC, I made reservations at BG for tea. We did have to wait a bit for seating, but it was so worth it. The view of the park was great. The restaurant was very elegant. My daughter is a vegetarian and they were able to accommodate her, serving her sandwiches and sweets separately from mine. The sandwiches were delicious and service impeccable, tea; wonderful. I would recommend making reservations and requesting seating with a view."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2018-03-19,4.0,"I have been looking for a good afternoon tea spot in the city, and I found a nice place with a great view. It is located inside the Bergdorf Goodman, on the 7th-floor. 

The inside was much bigger than I expected. With many windows lining up along the wall facing the Grand Army Plaza, it was nice and bright. 
And the view, oh my, it is awesome! We could see the Grand Army Plaza with its golden sculpture really well. And, we could see into the Central Park as well. The view would be even more fantastic once the trees become more green in Spring and Summer.

For afternoon tea, all the food items are pre-selected, only thing we need to choose is what kind of tea we want to go with the afternoon tea. They had nice selection of tea, and they use loose tea leaves, not tea bags. 

The three-tier afternoon tea kind of looked small at first glance, compared to some other ones I've had from other places. But, it was actually a good portion, not too much, not too little. 

On the bottom tier, they had savory items and tea sandwiches. Second tier was scones, with jams and devonshire cream. They only had two scones, but nice big size. The top tier was filled with petite sweets. They looked really great! I could not wait to get my hands into these ones!

Everything was really good, tasty and well prepared. We enjoyed them all very much. It was almost surprisingly good, since I didn't have high expectation for some reason. 

Our server was friendly, attentive, and most of all, funny! We always love it when we have a great server. It makes the experience extra fun. I would love to go back again for another afternoon tea, when the greens come back to the trees for even better view!"
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2020-01-18,5.0,Went here for afternoon tea and loved it! It was such a wonderful experience. Previously I had been to the plaza and some other hotels which were great as well. BG restaurant was different in a good way. Instead of being in a huge hotel lobby it had more of a penthouse vibe - overlooking Central Park. The interiors by Kelly Wearstler are great and I'm looking forward to going there again!!
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-07-04,5.0,I don't know how I forgot to put this review I don't know how I forgot to write this review. This was one of the most amazing teas that I have ever been to. We thoroughly enjoyed every single item on the Tea tray!  Service is excellent and professional! We'll definitely be back!
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2018-02-24,2.0,"Terrible service, they messed up my reservation which I had made well in advance. They were unwilling to fix their mistake by asking two people to move over one table so they could put two tables together. Instead they crammed six of us into a table for four.

Terrible food. My steak might have been good had it not been burnt beyond recognition. Too salty and I couldn't eat the over charred broccoli either. It was all bitter and burnt to a crisp. I was so hungry I didn't want to wait for another or make my tablemates wait. 

I didn't eat any of the broccoli - it was so burnt it was disgusting. I tried to eat around my charred steak and had the sharp burnt edge scrape my throat. I've attached a zoomed-in photo (even in this photo you can tell how burnt the steak is). 

Will never eat here again. And I recommend you avoid it too. Crammed space, bad food, terrible service."
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-05-28,5.0,"If you have a chance, you must stop in for lunch or tea. Yes, it is pricey, but you are at Bergdorf's darling! I had a glass of champagne(Henriot Blanc de Blancs), the potato leek soup, and the beet salad. Perf for a light lunch! Everything was very good. The service was excellent! I'm going to come back and have tea next time I am in Manhattan. Who can resist lunch or tea at an elegant restaurant with a glass of bubbly and a view of Central Park! Not me!!"
954,bg-restaurant-new-york-2,2019-08-18,4.0,"My boyfriend and I are huge fans of afternoon tea and this has to be our favorite food wise. It was initially hard to find (you have to go into BG then take the elevator up), but once you get to the floor, it's right there. 

The view is amazing, though the tables in the restaurant itself were a little cramped together. It took a while for our waiter to get us water and take our order, but once we ordered, our tea came right out. The finger sandwiches were refreshing, I particularly liked the chicken salad sandwich with truffle oil. We also really loved the warm scones, they had little bits of fruit in them and were heavenly with the clotted cream and strawberry preserve. 

A great place to have tea, though the service was a little lacking, would definitely come back again in the future!"
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2020-03-06,4.0,"Tried the rice bowl first time yesterday. I was surprised how good it was. Although I was a bit disappointed that you had pay extra $1 for the egg. It was deceiving when you are order on seamless. The picture shows an egg and also it doesn't give you an option to add an egg on seamless too. 
Also the shredded pork wasn't shredded pork. I had ground meat which also is deceiving so I was disappointed in that but the food was tasty. 

Came back today and ordered again this time at the register, added $1 egg and got red curry chicken. That was worth it and the food match the description! Def coming back to try other rice bowls!"
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2020-02-14,3.0,"I don't know. I was excited to come here, but I really wasn't wowed by the food. I got myself the combo; if you're not getting the bowl, the combo just makes so much more sense economically. I got the 2 buddha baos + 3 spring rolls combo. For $10.95, it's standard Urbanspace pricing. Fine with me.

The spring rolls were fine, but the baos kinda disappointed me. I really was disappointed with the tofu. Love the idea of crispy tofu, but I really wish the tofu had some zing or marinade to it because it just tasted bland. Like it was warm when you bit into it and then the tofu tasted like typical salad tofu. So much potential, but ended up disappointed. Oh well. 

Maybe next time, we'll see...."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2020-01-05,4.0,"This was delicious! Tasted amazing, but very pricey. Together this was about $12 for a relatively small meal, but I ate it from their stand at the Bryant Park festival, which made it feel worth it. 

The spring rolls were good, but I'd probably get the popcorn chicken as the side next time since those are pretty bomb."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-11-11,4.0,"Well I haven't tried the Urbanspace at Lexington Ave shop yet even if it's just a block from my office, but when I saw them at a stall at Bryant Park Winter Garden I said why not now. The menu has less options here and I so I just went for 2 Baos.

The Pork Belly which had scallion, cucumber, radish, crushed peanuts and hoisin sauce. And Buddha which is fried tofu, red cabbage, red onion, cilantro, black sesame seeds and sweet chili sauce.  The Buddha even if it was spicy was better than the pork belly.  I would not mind having it as an appetizer it if was serve by itself.

I think I will try the  Lexington shop next in order to get the Shrimp Tempura Bao and another Buddha."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-12-28,3.0,"We were disappointed with with the service and food at the urbanspace location.

We wanted a quick bite after shopping, and while we were the only people in line, the server was impatient to take our order.  

My son ordered the combo with 2 pork belly baos and popcorn chicken. There was not much pork inside the baos, and it was very saucy; so my son only took a couple bites. The popcorn chicken, while there were some good pieces which he ate, half were dry, not fresh, tough to chew, and tasted as if they had been sitting out for a while.

Would not recommend, at least in the evening. Maybe service and food are better during a busier lunch."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-12-16,4.0,"I have only been to their stand at Bryant Park and thought it was great to get fresh bao during the cold December weather. Eating street food in the actual outdoors makes the experience that much more enjoyable! I tried the peking duck bao (roasted duck, scallion, cucumber, crushed peanuts and hoisin sauce) and the Szechuan cow bow (braised beef shank, carrot, red onion, cilantro, crispy shallots and homemade Szechuan sauce. I loved the fresh onion and shallots but thought the meat was chewy. They have rice plates, noodles, popcorn chicken, spring rolls and tea as well. I'd love to try the rice plates next time. I liked that the bao was very soft and wasn't too thick. It also isn't chewy the way frozen bao taste. It's a bao-t time you try this place out."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-06-27,4.0,"A pretty decent pop up stand if you're looking for a quick snack at a premium price. I got 2 baos, both peking duck baos which happened to be a seasonal item, and 3 dumplings combo. For $13, it's not a bad deal compared to everything else in Urbanspace and being in NYC.

Looking forward to trying the other baos and possibly even the popcorn chicken, noodles, and bubble tea that they offer."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2020-01-20,5.0,I had the Red curry Chicken bao & Pork belly bao along with some dumplings. The pork belly bao was not for me but the chicken one was greatttt (the one with carrots)! Can't wait to come here again :)
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-11-02,3.0,"Sorry to say I had high hopes but was underwhelmed!

- ran out of bubbles for the bubble tea :(
- was rushed by the cashier even though there was no line
- pricing for combo + bubble tea does not include jasmine milk tea 
- buns were ripped in half and a little soggy on the bottom which made filling fall out
- cow bun was dryyy
- sesame noodles also felt dry even though there was sauce

Better buns to be had elsewhere."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-03-29,5.0,"Bao by Kaya is one of my favorite Broadway Bites popups. The duck bao is my favorite, 2nd fave pork belly. The popcorn chicken with spicy mayo (basically karaage) is the perfect accompaniment. My husband just wants the duck bao so I buy 6 individual baos for him. What really makes the duck bao is the hoisin sauce.

Broadway Bites tends to run out of duck by the end of the day, so I usually pick it up at lunchtime to take home for dinner. The bao hold up really well and don't get soggy.

Never been to the actual location, but Bao regularly appears at Broadway Bites, conveniently located near work."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-09-13,3.0,"Wanted to enjoy bao by kaya more but was a bit disappointed! I went with the combo 1 for dinner on a weeknight in urban space. Chose the duck and pork bao and the combo came with 3 spring rolls. I didn't feel like the bao had a ton of flavor. I preferred the duck over the pork. The bao were getting stuck to the wax paper they were served on. The spring rolls were too fried and crunchy for my liking. 

Probably wouldn't come back."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-11-23,3.0,"Decent bubble tea although but the most authentic and generic but usually can't go wrong with tea based. Friendly staff and a little line but really fast. Seats and tables around and upstairs, along with a restroom downstairs. Bao by Kaya is located closer to the back on the right side of Urbanspace. A couple different choices for gua bao, sides and some beverages. Apple Sidra is my childhood favourite and the only pop I drink, other than root beer. I had the Peking Duck Bao and the Pork Belly Bao. The meat is braised and cooked extremely well. Soft, flavourful, just perfect. The gua bao itself is just alright. The authentic Taiwanese ones are a bit more firm and like the skin of the gua bao feels stretchier (although you can't actually stretch it)..people who have had it will know what I'm talking about. This one is just soft so the sauce makes it slightly soggy faster and the moment I picked my gua bao to eat, which was like 3mins after I got it..it just fell apart. Authentic ones never do that. Doesn't bother me too much and doesn't change the flavour but the texture is just slightly different from what I grew up on and what I expected. Popcorn chicken is a bit dry and doesn't have that authentic Taiwanese popcorn chicken smell, and usually it's really juicy. Tastes good overall and I don't mind coming back to eat if I was around and hungry but need something quick. It's just not a place I'm willing to travel all the way for and it's not going to be my go to spot."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2018-12-22,4.0,"It is one of the food stands inside Urbanspace. It is similar to most spots inside the Urbanspace food courts around Manhattan: very good food and a little more pricey than other places. I ordered the combo of two baos and popcorn chicken. For the baos, I had the pork belly and duck. Both meats were tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The buns were soft. The sauces were excellent. In regards to the popcorn chicken, I could not really taste popcorn. It was basically chicken karage. It was delicious fried chicken. I definitely recommend the combo. The portions are good and I was definitely full.

In addition, I ordered a Jasmine green, milk bubble tea. It was sweet and creamy. It comes in a much more modest size than most bubble teas. However, it was enough."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2018-10-27,4.0,"I got a chance to try the baos a few days later.  Ordered the C2: 2 baos (pork belly and Peking duck which cost $0.50 extra) and popcorn chicken.

The pork belly was yummy and a lot cleaner to eat.  The Peking duck was also delicious.  I got some hoisan sauce over my fingers and a slice of duck fell out of the bun.  It could be me so more of awareness.

Popcorn chicken has a chunks of chicken fried in battered.  It was a bit salty but so good.  Didn't need the aioli sauce but it doesn't hurt one bit.

Definitely ordering again."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-10-17,4.0,"Great addition to the food court at Newport Mall. Usually a crowd but the line moves quickly and efficiently. I can see why they've become an instant favorite. The service is great, the food is excellent, and the pricing is just right. You can order ""combos"" as well as ""a la carte"" off the extensive menu of bao (red curry chicken!), noodles, and rice bowls. There are vegetarian options, as well. The selection will keep everyone happy and satisfied after stopping here for a good meal..."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2018-09-13,4.0,"This Bao by Kaya is located in the Urbanspace at 570 Lex. Urbanspace hosts a bunch of small food stands so there is something for every craving! I walked in on a Thursday around 12:30 pm ish, the stereotypical lunch rush time, and the place was packed. There's some seating in the middle as well as upstairs but looks like many people grab food and go. It can get a bit overwhelming if it's your first time but I highly recommend taking a breather and browsing around as there are so many options. From ramen to fried chicken sandwiches to tacos to sushi, it's your one stop shop for lunch! 

Bao by Kaya is right by the front and they serve Beijing style steamed bao sandwiches as well as boba tea. I got the combo order of 2 baos and 3 spring rolls. The spring rolls remained crispy even as I walked back to eat lunch at work and the sweet and sour dipping sauce is tasty. The 2 baos I got were the duck bao and the Szechuan cow bao. The duck bao is your classic Beijing bao, be sure to get this early as they do run out as the day goes on. The Szechuan cow bao was also tasty, unfortunately the Szechuan flavor was pretty mild and as an avid spicy food lover it bummed me out a bit. Also the baos were a little cold by the time I ate it but that just might be because I walked my lunch back to my office. 4 stars because I'm biased and at the end of the day no bao can compare to the baos in Beijing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

All together my meal costs under $11 which is pretty good considering the area that it's in. I'd definitely love to come back and check out the other food stands. Also if you are in the mood for a quick Beijing bao fix, this is a good spot. I totally see myself coming back here for lunch again!"
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2018-08-28,4.0,"Interestingly enough, we came here because I spotted a sign from Urban Space saying ""Breakfast! Lunch! Dinner!"", and next thing we knew, we were walking to Bao By Kaya! I ended up doing the 2 baos + 4 dumplings combination as well as ordering some Thai Tea with boba. 

My first bao was the shrimp tempura bao, which was garnished with some veggies and sauce. The bao itself didn't have much flavor, but that allowed the inside contents' flavors to flourish. The bao was very soft, almost like a melt-in-your-mouth kind of soft. The veggies were overpowered by the sauce that reminded me of Yum Yum sauce and moderately salty shrimp tempura. The shrimp tempura would have been too salty for me if there weren't veggies or such a neutral bao. 

The second bao was the peking duck bao, which is apparently has a limited amount of quantities per day. Because I ate this one second, the bao was becoming saturated by the duck juices. When I tried to pick up the bao, it felt apart and split in half - one half in my hand with duck juice trickling down, the other half *thankfully* landing in my small tray. The duck was too salty for me, even with the neutral bao. This bao had fewer vegetables than the first bao, so it couldn't neutralize the salt as well. I am glad I got the duck bao, but I don't think I would order it again.

The dumplings turned out to be chicken dumplings. They were fried a little too much. Because of this, it was hard to taste the chicken inside. I would suggest Bao by Kaya to write out that the dumplings are chicken dumplings as opposed to having the customers guess what they are. 

The Thai Tea was not as sweet relative to other Thai Teas that I have had, but it was very bold, so I kept drinking it to enjoy such a strong flavor. The boba was average in my opinion. It was somewhat chewy, but it felt more like somewhat bland tapioca balls as opposed to sweet boba. Thankfully the strong flavor of the Thai Tea helped the boba taste better.

I am glad such a spontaneous lunch turned into such a wonderful eating experience! I can't wait to come back here!"
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-04-01,4.0,"This was a fine meal - the noodles were simple but tasty (served cold), but I didn't love the beef bao. The meat was really fatty, probably half of the meat was just fat, but the flavor was good. Weren't the best I've ever had, but it was fun to try something new. If I went back, I'd try a different bao. I would recommend the pork belly bao though!"
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-07-03,3.0,"We came here once a week. It has the best choices of food selection in the food hall in my opinion. The food is most of the time decent. And I have to say the staff is super nice all the time. But there are 3 issues I hope the owner can solve:
- They use milk powders! Yuck!!! I ordered a milk tea from there I'm like this taste really weird, like expired milk. I asked the guy who gave me the drink and he said they use milk powder. If you are serving milk tea, respect the culture and use real milk
- occasionally, the content in the bao served was barely lukewarm. The bao was cold. They should be hot or at least warm
- When we come at night, the Peking duck bao option is gone, EVERY TIME. If you realize that's a quick selling item every day, wouldn't you increase the stock? That's just poor operations management."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2018-09-21,4.0,"I wasn't hungry when I visited Bao By Kaya, but I wanted to at least try it.

I ordered one (1) Szechuan Cow Bao.

The bao was soft, the meat was juicy, and everything else was spot on except for the cilantro. To be honest, I didn't get any cilantro. When I took my first bite, all of my cilantro fell out of the bao, missed the small tray, and onto the table. I wasn't gonna pick up the cilantro from the table and put it back into my bao. Additionally, I was careful to make sure that anything that fell out of my bao would make it onto the tray. However, I still missed. I'm gonna blame it half on my and half on the small tray.

Besides that, I don't have other complaints because it was delicious."

955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-03-16,4.0,"Close spot for lunch. They serve Taiwanese cuisine with a twist. 
I ordered the minced pork over rice. 

Service - delivery time is decently fast as i never had to wait too long. 

Price - Coming from flushing I do feel it is over priced by $2  for what it is, even if it is the city... 

Flavor - it's a tad on the salty side in my opinion. It is interesting how they add curry with coconut rice. I think you'll either love it or hate it. I personally thought they did a good job. The minced pork is on the leaner side as I've seen it with more fat at other places."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-02-09,5.0,"I've always been a fan of Bao by Kaya ever since I found their stand at a Broadway Bites popup. 
My go-to order has always been their Pork Belly bao and the Peking Duck bao, which are both great and highly recommended. I get it with a side of Popcorn Chicken, which is the BEST I've had. 
I came across their Lexington Ave location by accident, and couldn't resist walking in to get an order. I tried the Szechuan Cow and Pork Belly baos with a side of dumplings. Both meats were tender, and honestly seems it's only improved from the first time I had Bao by Kaya. I highly recommend these two baos, but just be aware that their Peking Duck is limited through the day.
I ordered the Thai tea boba, and was shocked because there are only very few places I've seen here in NYC that sell authentic Thai tea and half-and-half as their Bubble Tea formula (rather than just some powdered mix). Their bubbles were also very soft, and great for the overall price. 
Love this place!"
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-07-01,3.0,"I came here yesterday evening, it wasn't packed during that time. Literally no line whatsoever at any food stand inside. Actually the entire East side was fairly empty since everyone was over at the other side for the parade. 
Anyway....I ordered the pork belly bao and a Szechuan cow bao. I only had a bite of each. I normally love pork belly but I really didn't like the way they make it here. It was a lot leaner than pork belly should be. It was lacking fat! Also it was overpowered by the hoisin sauce. The bao was in half so it was a lil difficult to eat. The beef shank was much tastier, the meat was tender. 
I came here since I had a discount, but I really don't think it was that good especially at $4.99 each. I get it.. rent, labor, etc is expensive, but the food is just okay. Now if I had received a tender, slightly fatty juicy piece of pork belly then it would've been worth it, but it was just a big disappointment. 
Glad I tried it, now I know not to come to these food courts in the city. I've been to 3 or 4 of them and I've yet to find one food stand that I like. 
2 stars for the beef shank bao. One more star since I'm being generous. It wasn't bad... it just wasn't that good. Maybe I have to go much earlier in the afternoon to get a fresher bao? Guess I'll never find out."

955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-03-22,3.0,"Overall pretty tasty but it depends on what you get. I thought the red chicken curry was a standout.

 I got the two bao with popcorn chicken combo. Buddha Bao and red chicken curry bao. Chicken curry being the best. Both were a bit soggy on the bottom so they fell apart and it was very messy. They came with quite a few raw onions inside which was an unpleasant surprise and picked out. 

The popcorn chicken was crispy but also very fatty and didn't feel so great after. 

I'd go again but just for the red chicken curry!"

The staff is always friendly and they give you your order within minutes. My go-to is the combo of 2 bao and popcorn chicken. My favorite bao is the pork belly one so I usually get 2 of those. The combo is around $11.90 and definitely worth it. Definitely consider this place when you are around Urbanspace and want a quick and tasty eat.

955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2018-04-09,3.0,"Conveniently located right near the 51st Street 6 train station. Look for signs that say ""URBAN SPACE."" It just opened last week according to the staff at Bao By Kaya. Super cool spot, 1st floor is a bunch of food vendors and 2nd floor is seating area and restrooms. 

After circling Urban Space, decided to give Bao By Kaya a try! 

Ordered C2 (2 Baos + Popcorn Chicken) $11.75
+$2.99 bubble tea if ordered with combo
+$0.50 if you pick the duck bao in your combo
My lunch turned out to be a little over $16, which was pretty expensive but decided to try it out anyway and get a little variety in my meal!

Classic Bubble Tea - 3.5 stars, great taste of authentic bubble tea but the ice made the flavors diluted. Probably would have been better with less ice.

Pork Belly Bao - 4 stars, sauce complemented the pork belly nicely. Pork belly had some fat to it but not over-bearing. My favorite out of the 2. The baos are steamed so it was fresh and fluffy, just like baos should be.

Peking Duck Bao - 3 stars, it was okay... I'm not sure what it was missing but I've had many peking duck baos in my lifetime (I LOVE peking duck) and this one was not up to my expectations, especially given that it's a $0.50 upcharge too. I think maybe because the duck skin was soggy and a bit chewy?

Popcorn chicken - 4 stars, chicken had good flavors. Just eat it while it's hot. Once it gets cold, it doesn't taste as good."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-05-15,4.0,"Have had an addiction so to speak of bao buns for months now and this is the only spot Thats given me my fix . The four stars is mainly based off their stellar curry chicken bao . The beef is the only other option I tried and its not bad by any stretch ,just not as as satisfying as their curry chicken .You want to do a combo when coming here to get the best value . I usually do the two baos and 3 dumplings. They run a good business here as food is always given promptly and taste is consistent. Definitely one of the more popular choices here at urban space and one of the best for sure !"
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2018-11-22,4.0,"One of my lunch go-tos. Really conveniently located in urban space. 

Baos: 5/5
The baos have a super fluffy bun with flavorful, melt in your mouth meat. I typically go for the pork belly bao here- my favorite for sure. I like the buddha bao here too. 

Dumplings: 2/5
Not bad but not great. They are fried, and filled with a medium spicy king pao chicken. Can add these to a two bao combo. Wouldn't order them again though. 

Bubble tea: 4/5
No particularly interesting flavors and can't specify sweetness level, but boba are always fresh. I like the classic milk tea here.

Price: 3/5
Baos are $5 each. Can get an $11 combo with 2 baos and 3 dumplings. Bubble tea is $5, and $4 if you order a combo. Somehow I alway find myself spending $15 here for a medium quantity of food. The food is always good, but the prices are steep given this is just lunch. However, the price points compare to the other lunch locations in urbanspace.

Service: 4/5
During weekday lunch it's pretty hectic- expect 10-15 in line. It takes about 10 minutes once you've ordered to get food. If you order on Ritual ahead of time, you can skip the line and pick up your order."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2018-10-20,4.0,"Stopped by heralds square eats and am glad I did! I got the combo, 2 buns and side of springs rolls about (12-13$). The duck bun was delicious as was the popcorn chicken- my only complaint is I wished the bun was warm. It was a colder day when I went but otherwise flavors were great and the spring rolls were hot and came with a delicious sweet and spicy sauce. Highly recommend, but not if you're ok with cold buns..."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2018-10-31,1.0,"Came here to grab quick lunch, obviously this is Americanized Taiwanese food, ordered the Taiwanese Ru Rou Rice bowl (rice topped with five spices seasoned minced pork and some veggies) and bubble tea. The portion of the rice was really small, and apparently it was super unauthentic, guess Taiwanese would flip out if they see this so called 滷肉飯. First off, there was no meat, it was really just the sauce! You charge $11 and can't even put some legit protein on it? To be honest, it tasted ok but the portion and the price really turned me off, paid $16 for the fake 滷肉飯 and artificially flavored bubble tea, as a takeout order, definitely not a good deal compared to other lunch options in the neighborhood."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-04-17,4.0,"Having lived in Hong Kong for several years, I consider myself a bit of a bao snob. That being said, the baos were very tasty! Of the two bao that I got, I preferred the Red Curry Chicken over Shrimp tempura--I found it to be more flavorful and interesting overall. Will definitely be back to try the others soon."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2017-10-11,4.0,"Got the two bao and popcorn chicken combo at the stand around 34th street Heard Square. The peking duck bao was delicious and everything I expect a peking duck bao to be. I also had the cow bao which was really flavorful. I think it could be improved by adding some sort of sauce on top though. The popcorn chicken was also really well done but kind of big for popcorn chicken. They weren't bite sized and too large to dip into the tiny container of spicy mayo that they give you. Best to pour it all over the chicken. 

I also found the pricing to be kind of weird because they weren't whole numbers and even after tax, they didn't end up as whole numbers."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-08-19,4.0,"Was here actually last night after a night of drinking and bought one of their teas,(Thai Ice Tea with bubble) and was impressed. It was really different, in taste and in look, wasn't what I expected at all but was good. I will be back to try the other teas and even the food."
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-05-08,4.0,"I had the R1 pork belly combo and it was delicious.. green sauce was nice, garlicky and portion more than I expected.  Will be back to try the red curry chicken one.. the other stuff looked great too"
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2017-11-22,4.0,"First tried Boas by Kaya when they were at Bryant Park's winter market last year. Glad to see them back!

I tried the Buddha Baos and they're delicious! Fried tofu, diced cabbage and carrot and a good sweet and sour sauce. They could use a little more carrot/cabbage/crunch. 

My friend tried the Pork Belly Bao which was good and the Schezwan Bao which wasn't that great.

Wish they had more veggie options, especially since they do a red curry chicken. Red curry tofu, anyone?"
955,bao-by-kaya-new-york-4,2019-08-20,3.0,"Got the pork bao and chicken bao. Pork didn't have that much flavor, just salty in general. Chicken was okay. Wouldn't order here again."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2020-02-18,5.0,"I love this hidden gem of a cafe! I can almost always find a place to sit here and it is a great spot to sit and get some work done will enjoying delicious coffee. They also have a great variety of food and pastries. For 7.50, you can get a large slice of quiche with a side salad. It is a great deal! I love their goat cheese and caramelized onion quiche. It is super flavorful and I never even need to put salt or pepper on it, which is rare for me. 

Today I enjoyed a slice of my favorite quiche as well as an iced latte with oat milk. Both were great and it was the perfect spot for me to get some work done in the afternoon. I think the reason this place is a little less populated is because it is right next to a Starbucks. But, trust me, you should be coming here over Starbucks. It is a great coffee shop!"
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2020-04-20,4.0,"I love everything about Tisserie. 

The salads (which I never ate before Meal Pal) are full of flavor and healthy vegetables. Roasted Veggies fills you up. The beet goat cheese salad over spinach is lighter but you feel so virtuous eating it! 

The juices are good and if you want sandwiches or pastries, you're set too. 

They remain open (when so many in the area have given up due to COVID 19). 

Nice people. 

Support them if you want them to be around when this nightmare is over."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2020-02-16,5.0,"What a hidden Gem right next to Starbucks.  Staff is very friendly and efficient.  
Coffee and pastries were magnificent.

Highly Recommended from the Sexy Traveler."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-11-17,4.0,"Ritual app had a deal for this gem, and thank goodness!

I have been a few times now and enjoyed myself each time. 
Their cafe beverages are good and well balanced. I've tried their mocha matcha, yummy and lol lots of caffeine, I like the flavor, usually get it with oat milk. Same goes for matcha latte with oat milk, either hot or cold.

For food I've only had savory options, Tortilla Española, which is yummy and served with a side salad (nice!) This is a Vegetarian option, consisting of eggs, potatoes cheese and veggies. Pretty reasonable for the price. $4.5

I've also had a mini fresh mozzarella sandwich, it was good and simple. 

The interior is cozy and you will find people chillin with their friends or computers, or are those the same? 

They have sweet treats as well, baked goods, I haven't tried any yet but they look amazing and look forward to trying them out. 

Definitely recommend, and will return!"
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-12-11,4.0,"Tisserie is a charming coffee shop with nice pastry and lunch options located near Carnegie Hall. It's located near my office and I like to go there at lunchtime. Today I went around 1:30 and was able to find a seat. 

Ordered:

Spinach, mushroom and cheese empanadas ($3.50 each): these were quite satisfying. The outside is more dough like than flaky and the filling is flavorful. If this sounds good to you, I'd give it a try. I believe they reheat them in a microwave so they are soft, not crunchy but this doesn't bother me. 

Mini caprese sandwich ($3.50)- you can get this sandwich cold or hot. Today I opted to have it warm. It is simple- fresh mozzarella, tomato and a little basil. I find it's a good option paired with something else or as a snack."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2020-02-12,3.0,I came here as I was craving fresh cookies at work. I saw the giant salted Carmel and Nutella cookie and was instantly sold on the combo. I also ordered a small latte to go with it.  I was overall disappointed as the menu and photos looked promising by other reviewers. The cookie was mediocre and had a slight baking soda taste. It wasn't chewy and didn't taste like Nutella. The latte deflated and tasted burnt.
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-08-26,5.0,"This is a good cafe for working, with reliable wifi, a bathroom and plenty of seating. There is a fair amount of traffic in and out of the cafe so it can get noisy and may not be ideal for people who needs a quiet environment. 
 The prices for drinks for pretty reasonable for New York and they have a stamp card for loyal customers. They used Stumptown coffee, one of my favorite brands, and my latte came out smooth and rich. I did not get any food at this visit but they all look appetizing, and they have la newyorkina ice cream as well for those looking for a nice summer treat!
Overall a good cafe for working, close to major attractions as well as the subway"
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-10-08,4.0,"Good cafe to do work, as long as you don't mind lots of background noise. The cafe has decent amount of seating and good Wifi. Don't forget to ask for the receipt if you want the WiFi and bathroom PW! 

Got a medium matcha vanilla latte which was tasty and ""artsy"" but comes to about $6. Will probably skip the vanilla next time as it seems to be charged extra."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2020-01-05,5.0,"Yummy food and lovely ambience. We came to Central Park for Macy's thanksgiving parade. We got super hungry after all the standing at the parade, so we were here for brunch. Super yummy coffee and croissants. I got cappuccino and almond croissant. Would give 5/5 just for the taste of the croissant. But, it gets super busy so we had to stand for sometime to secure a place. Overall, awesome experience."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2020-03-17,3.0,"Came here in the morning to get some coffee and breakfast. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg and bacon on croissant. It was average in my opinion. They only gave me one single slice of bacon which was a bit disappointing...iced coffee also didn't taste that extraordinary...honestly for the price, I would much rather go somewhere else."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-10-26,4.0,"Excellent find in Manhattan. Coffee is bold rich and full bodied, yet silky smooth. Truly excellent Joe! Wifey had her usual latte and I a cappuccino. We needed a bite for breakfast so found something yummy for each of us. I had a salmon sandwich and she had fresh fruit. Prices are reasonable and the staff are friendly. The weight is moderate but not too bad. We would certainly return."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-04-17,2.0,"I was really excited to try this place for the bri, fig, walnut crossaint. I also liked thier matcha photos on yelp! Being in NYC there are SO many options to choose from and you want to choose the cream of the crop which is why I went to yelp to find them.

They didn't have the crossaint that was advertised all over various social media platforms, an hour after open. In fact they barley had anything in the case other than quiches and an egg bacon crossaint. The lady at register wasnt sure when anything would be brought out... I could understand if it was minutes after they opened... But an hour after? Have your stuff out.

I defaulted to a macha latte and a chocolate crossaint and my friend got an apple danish and fresh orange juice. I was extremely saddened to see that the latte was not prepared with any design and wasnt even blended well 0-2... The crossaint was chrunchy on the outside and not what I would have expected from a ""bakery"" with great ratings. 

Over all the experience was meh to me. Over priced basic food with a long wait in order to order."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-11-28,4.0,"This spot is right around the corner from work and I recently popped in for a matcha latte to give me a bit of energy for the night. The latte wasn't drowned in sugar like Starbucks which was refreshing. They also have a selection of pastries, quiches and sandwiches that I may come back for during lunch. Seating is varied with seats at the counter, tables and also a couch in the back. BookmarkIng for a future quick coffee meeting."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-04-19,4.0,"Made a beeline to the Starbucks next door but discovered there was NO toilet there. There was a good toilet in Tisserie locked with a code provided on the purchase receipt. 

The toilet needed some attention when we visited mid afternoon--just throw out the trash :) but we were grateful for the relief and chill space. 

The vibe inside was chill, coffee was good. They use a citrusy ground for their espresso which is not my preference."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-09-28,4.0,Cute little place.  Was headed to Starbucks and glad I popped in here instead.  Yummy cold pressed juices.  I got an energy blend.  Great spot to sit and watch the city hustle and bustle.
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2020-02-02,5.0,"Another great cafe to stop at when in Manhattan. The sandwiches and coffee are delicious. My food was fresh and the coffee had a great flavor. This is a popular place and it gets busy, but I think it's worth coming here."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-07-18,4.0,"Nice spot with great coffee and food options! I had a small iced (Stumptown) coffee, mini tuna sandwich and almond cheese danish. The tuna sandwich was sort of hard to eat because the roll was a little tough, but still tasty. They also warned up the danish, which I so appreciate. 4.5 stars."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-06-23,4.0,"Mushroom and their Veggie Quiches were a good choice. They come with a  salad, which I was not a fan of. 
Good way to get some protein in the area. 

They have a wide assortment of sandwiches. The price are high in this area. Decent sandwiches."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2018-10-25,4.0,"Tisserie on 55th is a bright cafe a few blocks south of Central Park. They do a huge array of bites and pastries you don't normally see together. Palmiers and pastelitos? Quiches and empanadas? I would say they're definitely French-Latin influenced, which is a nice mix.

The quiches I got were great. They recommended the Tomato & Blue Cheese and I got another Mushroom Quiche for later. Both were flaky, eggy, and flavorful, the blue cheese not off-putting as some can be. I have my eyes on the Sweet Plantain & Latin Cheese next time!

Desserts were tasty, but could be fresher. Guava & Cream Cheese Chausson had a sweet and tart filling, but the pastry envelope not very flaky. Nutella Brioche was so doughy, with a scant smearing of Nutella. I buy jars of Nutella just to avoid this fate, so a light smear doesn't cut it. Friendly if slow service, with seating indoors, but take it to the Park instead!"
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-10-18,4.0,"After jogging through central park, I really needed a drink of some kind. Ordered a matcha latte here and noticed their extensive menu! I'm not normally in new york, but if I were, I can see myself frequenting this place for more coffees/teas or some of their sandwiches."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-12-07,5.0,"This part of NYC is a stinky hellhole. It was 36 degrees outside and my wife saw a sign that said Stumptown Coffee - which I have frequently brought up at least once a week. Going inside, it was warm and spacious with open chairs available - strange for a coffee shop in winter.

My wife got a caramel latte with almond milk. She verbally said ""mmmmm,"" which clearly meant it was good. She also wanted to get a carrot muffin (how fun), but didn't get it because she ate a banana 10 minutes prior.


I got a Hair Bender drip and learned what all the hype has been about."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-11-08,4.0,"Very cozy cafe. They have seating area, with a little sofa. Food choice could be wider, but it's tasty though. I had amazing croissant with Nutella and strawberry and banana. And the tea was great too."

The avocado toast is good and ricotta toast is okay."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-04-09,4.0,"This is perhaps my favorite boulanger in Manhattan. Today I tried their Quinoa baguette and it was fresh, crisp, tasty, and very light. And healthful too. Their help is always very polite and helpful. And for coffee lovers, they offer a full cappuccino/espresso service."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-05-17,5.0,"Busy place during breakfast in Midtown West Manhattan.  Full of locals, commuters and some tourists (like me) grabbing breakfast before a busy day.

Great vibe. Nicely decorated.  The sitting area did not feel crowded since most patrons were buying Coffee and Pastries to go.

I had the Tisserie Special Sandwich which they heated in a Panini press.  The Sandwich was great.

The Stumptown Coffee was prepared perfectly.

Service was fast, friendly and efficient."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-10-25,3.0,Ordered a medium latte and pumpkin muffin. The muffin was delish and served warm but the latte was basically milk with a hint of espresso. Clean and plenty of seating. I did think it was on the chilly side while sitting there. Prices are slightly slower compared to other coffee joints in the area
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2020-02-08,4.0,The best thing about NYC is it makes room service obsolete!! For my Francophile sweetie's birthday ordered breakfast. Avocado toast -crunchy/soft bread piled high w delicious avo and the salad had some crack dressing that made us eat it all! Pastries delish -only left off a star cause my last really good croissant was in Paris last summer Good latte & super fast/sweet delivery woman
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-12-21,5.0,Stayed at the Manhattan Club in the same building and stopped in the first morning for a quick grab and go. Little did we know we'd choose to come back the next day just for their breakfast. Had the frittata day one. It was delicious and came with a little mixed green salad with vinaigrette. Delicious! The next day I had the caramelized onion quiche. Equally as delicious. My boyfriend had a plain croissant and it was super fresh and yummy. Make this place your planned breakfast spot. So good.
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-12-09,5.0,Patisserie at its best! Classic well crafted bakery founded in a cozy NY café ambiant. One of the best oat milk capps that I had in the city.
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2020-03-07,5.0,"My husband's white chocolate mocha was excellent! The cashier was friendly. She gave us a recommendation for the double chocolate chip muffin, and she was right! The tables were clean. I didn't love my chai, but that was my fault.for ordering it with oatmilk - I don't like oatmilk! So, not their fault. The ambiance was lovely."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-06-15,4.0,"I found this place before flying into NYC. I am staying at the hotel next door so it's very convenient for me to grab breakfast or coffee here. It was busy today but not overly crowded. A great selection of music was playing in the restaurant this morning.

I ordered the breakfast croissant sandwich, coffee and OJ (freshly squeezed) this morning. I enjoyed it very much. I think next time I will get the quiche which looked amazing and there are several varieties to choose from."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-01-20,5.0,"Such a cute coffee shop! Bright and warm, the staff are always smiley and friendly. They serve the ever-delicious Stumptown coffee.

957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-01-06,4.0,"What a cute little coffee shop. We were walking towards Central Park and ran across this coffee shop right next to a Starbucks. We decided to check this place out. It's got plenty of places to sit inside and a good place to work. They have food and they have lots of yummy drinks along with your regular coffees and teas. My fiancé got a cold mocha drink which was delicious and had yummy chunks of chocolate in it. I got a latte which also was delicious and just the right amount of sweetness, usually I have to put sugar in it lattes but this time I did not. If you're near the area I strongly recommend you come here and have a cup of coffee and a snack!"
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-11-14,5.0,"Hip little coffee shop in the heart of Midtown that can get quite busy in the morning but their lattes and sandwiches are worth the wait. There's a starbucks directly next door, where I can order my coffee ahead of time and skip the wait, but I leave home a little earlier in the morning so I can make time to get it here. Prices are unbeatable too. Their sandwich selection makes my mouth water. My daily go-to."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2019-11-24,5.0,"I came in here to kill a few minutes before seeing a play around the corner. Very cute, homey place with a friendly staff and a nice selection of baked goods.

957,tisserie-new-york-2,2018-11-30,5.0,"Needed a quick dinner before a show, and randomly popped in! Had a fantastic egg salad sandwich and a hot cup of tea (apparently I'm middle aged now and that's what I do), and it was comfy to sit back for a few minutes and hang! 

Not too busy at around 6pm on a weeknight, and definitely a great place to stop and grab a quick bite!"
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2020-02-01,5.0,"This little gem of a cafe has delicious breakfast foods (haven't tried their lunch).  From savory quiches to sweet pasteries, there's something everyone.  The banana, strawberry, Nutella croissant is divine!  The service is generally quick, and though it seemed busy, there were empty seats available each time I went.  It's a little noisy with all the people chattering, but nothing that you wouldn't find in similar places.."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2018-03-16,5.0,"You had me at alfajores.

We found Tisserie on Yelp while looking for some caffeine after visiting MoMA. On a Sunday afternoon, the place was bustling. Thanks to a photo on Yelp, I saw that they had alfajores, a South American pastry: shortbread cookies filled with dulce de leche and dusted coconut on the sides.

I ordered one for each of us along with a double espresso and the dulce de leche latte. We took a seat at a small table and our order was up in moments. I was afraid my latte was going to be too sweet but it ended up being the perfect amount of caramely goodness along with frothy, silky milk.

We did not have lunch but noticed a variety of sandwiches and quiches on display. Things are a bit pricey as it cost us around $19 for everything.

The service was super friendly and we would recommend it for a treat or coffee! 

PS-they serve Stumptown."
957,tisserie-new-york-2,2020-01-13,3.0,"Just went here today. The ""food for all"" promo code that they offer did not work. But we got a smoked salmon sandwich and a raisin pastry. It was a bit overpriced for the small amount of food. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either."

I went there a lot and they are consistent."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2020-01-26,4.0,"I'd give this place a 5 if I wasn't completely irked by the way they handle their line. The bagels themselves were definitely high quality, among the top five I've had, but their salmon was by far the best I've had. It was so tender, flavorful NOT fishy, and perfectly complemented the bagel.  I got  plain cream cheese with the lox, rather than the lox cream cheese where it's blended in, and I recommend you do the same.

So my qualm with the line is that they treated online order with higher priority than in person orders. The line is single file, and orderly enougH within the restaurant, but I think they handled 2 online orders for every in person order, so it took longer than needded for the line to progress."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2020-05-18,5.0,"I was a young teenager when I first enjoyed this bagel store. I am now well over 50 years old and I still get excited to have the opportunity to patronize the place. 
This is one of those bagel places that we New Yorkers boast about; a place that you bring tourists to and say, uh? Huh? Huh? Is that the greatest bagel you've ever tasted?"
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-12-17,5.0,"We started our day looking to go to a well known bagel spot in the city.  When we got there the line was insane and we didn't know where else to go.. thanks to Yelp, I came across NY Jumbo Bagels. There was still quite a line on a Saturday morning but bearable.  

I had the lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel. It was the best breakfast. I wasn't expecting much from a bagel but it left a lasting impression. 

Definitely stop by here if you're in NYC. You won't be disappointed at all!"
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-10-15,3.0,"I want to love this place. It has one of the best bagels in the city- fluffy on the inside, good crisp when toasted on the outside. 


However, what prevents this from getting 4 stars is 1. Inconsistent portions on the breakfast sandwiches (bacon egg and cheese, see pic, decent sample size of getting this multiple times and sausage egg and cheese) and 2. One or two employees being in a bad mood when you place your order and seemingly taking their bad mood out on you or possibly even reducing how much food you get on your breakfast sandwich. 

So solid bagel, everything else not so solid. 3 stars."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-12-22,2.0,"Ordered an everything bagel with jalapeño cream cheese today. I've been here quite a few times before but today was very disappointing. Never had I've received a bagel with so little cream cheese. It was literally one smear on one side of the bagel. If you're charging $4+ for a bagel with cream cheese, at least add a bit more. See pic for more details."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2020-01-26,2.0,I was in the city and really wanted a good bagel. Unfortunately I didn't have a good experience here. My bagel was stale. Not sure about the quality here.
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-12-28,5.0,"We wanted to get bagels on our last day in the city and walked from our hotel over to Ess-a-bagel and the line was out the door. We noped out of there and I figured there has to be another good bagel place near by so I found HOT NY Jumbo Bagels. One of the pics on yelp said ""if you don't want to wait in line for ""ess-a-bagel"" come here! So we did. I ordered the lox on everything with scallion cream and my partner ordered the tuna salad on sesame with plain cream cheese. We both agreed that there is no way ess-a-bagel was better than Jumbo Bagels! Their bagels were so good, we ordered a half dozen to go and we brought them back to Florida. 

Don't ever wait an hour in line for a bagel in NYC."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-09-12,5.0,"Nothing beats a classic salmon & cream cheese bagel. My fiancé and I came here to get some breakfast before our pre-cana class. 8AM on a Saturday, we noticed there was still a bit of a line, although it moved very quickly. The store could probably comfortably seat 20 people, so it was pretty small, but it's more of a grab and go kind of store. 

We got our salmon & cream cheese bagels and WOW they were so big, we could have just split one and that would have been! The salmon was fresh, the bagel was perfectly crunchy, and the people serving us were nice and efficient. What more could we have asked for? This is a fantastic place to get some NY bagels!"
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-12-07,4.0,"great bagel spot in midtown east (where there's honestly not a lot of good options) WAY better selection and quality and prices than Tal up the street on 1st. i'll make the trek here any day. don't have cucumber but that's okay, i'm willing to look past it lol."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2020-03-05,5.0,Honestly incredible late night food. We came in with a bunch of people and the service was prompt and the bagels and toppings were really good! The lox spread is delicious and the bagels are a nice consistency! Montreal bagels are better but as far as non-montreal bagels go these were good.
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2020-02-21,5.0,"DELICIOUS! You could tell these bagels were totally fresh. The everything bagel was so yummy, had all the right toppings on it. They have a few tables if you want to eat there or easily offer stuff to go. I would 100% come back!"

My local deli has the same thing for $1.75. These people are on crack."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-05-28,4.0,"NY Jumbo Bagels was great but there's one major area where there could be improvement... quality. The bagels alone are great and I can't complain there. However, I have to say the egg, bacon, and cheese bagel sandwiches are just eh. The bacon is microwavable, very thin, and maybe one or 1.5 pieces on the sandwich. It's basically just an egg sandwich. 

I wouldn't order this again but I did enjoy the bagel and the jalapeno cream cheese.

I'm sure I'll be back!"
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-11-21,4.0,"NY Jumbo Bagels is a local bagel joint/deli. It won't serve up delicacies found at the big names like Essa or Russ, but it's better than some of the popular chains in the city. They also offer a wide variety of toppings for your bagels."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2020-03-12,5.0,We tried NY Jumbo Bagels based on the reviews and were not disappointed! Great bagel sandwiches and other types of sandwiches. The owner was there and was very friendly and helpful. Not as crowded as usual due to the coronavirus scare. I highly recommend you eat there and support this business that has been operating since 1977!
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-09-24,4.0,Ess A Bagel's line was way too long so I decided to check this place out instead! The service was quick and everyone was very friendly. I got a bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel and it was $6. Pretty yummy but a little too salty for my liking.
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-07-27,4.0,Solid Bagel Joint in the neighborhood. Busy area but they get you in and out rather quickly. Large selection of Bagels.
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-12-15,5.0,"For the most delicious bagels and friendly counter service visit Jumbo Bagels! My fave is the lox and cream cheese bagel, yum!!"
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2018-12-05,4.0,"The perfect bagel spot! I have actually been working half a block away for almost two years and am JUST NOW trying them out. 

Last week, I was running into work late but was starving after not having dinner. Called them on my way in to place a quick order and it was ready as soon as I got there. Maybe 10-15 min? I will definitely be back again. Perfectly toasted and fast. 

Things to note
- There will be a line but they move quickly and efficiently 
- 7 dollar min on cards (but they let me slide with 6 and some change.)"
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-12-06,4.0,"The bagels are amazinggggg. Everything you would expect in a try NY style bagel. Fresh, crusty outside and light and not too dense on the inside. Love love love them. The egg white  omelette was disappointing but I shouldn't have ordered an omelette from a bagel shop."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-07-23,3.0,"I got this on Uber eats at 2:00 AM after flying in late to NY. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, mozzarella sticks and a muffin. The bagel was solid and I enjoyed it. The mozzarella sticks and the muffin were far below average (not sure why I ordered mozzarella sticks) so i would suggest this place if you are interested in bagel only."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2020-01-18,5.0,My personal favorite amongst Tal and Ess-a-Bagel. The bagels at ny jumbo bagels are very fresh and warm. There are over 10-15 different kinds of cream cheese and have a myriad of toppings. The jalapeno cream cheese is my favorite! The jalapenos are the perfect level of spice. The staff is super nice and their delivery is also very fast. Bagel deliveries are great- still warm and taste awesome.
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-11-29,1.0,"I came here around 4:30am to order a few bagels for my colleagues and I. Based off the mostly good reviews, I figured this trip to the bagel shop would be pretty normal. However...

The store was pretty dirty, but that wasn't out of the ordinary for me. I understand that hole-in-the-wall places arent always the cleanest, but typically the food is perfectly fine. I had a large order of 5 bagels with lox and cream cheese, and 5 bagels with only cream cheese. The young man who was working seemed pretty normal. I gave him my order and he got to work. Because of the large order, he called out to someone in the back for some assistance. The man who came out from the back was wearing a dirty tee shirt and an even dirtier apron. It was disgustingly filthy. He was tasked with slicing the lox and placing it onto the bagels that the younger gentleman spread cream cheese on. Even before the man came out from the back, I noticed that the lox was being stored in a separate glass fridge with 1 piece of salmon that looked a little old and 2 other fresh pieces of salmon. The older piece of salmon was not wrapped in plastic like the other two, and a knife that was used for slicing it was stored on top of the older salmon with food residue still on the blade. As I was alarmed by this point, I wanted to check the temperature of the fridge. Luckily it was at the ""safe"" food range. The man removes the old piece of salmon to start slicing it. He placed it onto counter space without cleaning it beforehand and proceeded to use the dirty knife. Before slicing, he used a dirty rag to clean the blade and then started to slice. After all of the lox had been sliced and placed onto the bagel, he gets a different knife to slice the bagel sandwich in half. Once again, that knife was visibly dirty and he used a different dirty rag to clean that one before slicing. As I was going to pay, he was talking to the young man to confirm the order. He was doing the math in his head. His first calculation exceeded what I thought it would cost. I then repeated my order to him so he could double-check his math to ensure that I was being charged the correct price. I honestly believe he was attempting to charge me for more than I ordered. I then brought out my calculator to figure out the price myself. We agreed on the number which was about $30 lower than his first estimate. I paid and left. After watching all of this disgusting food prep, I didn't have the stomach to eat my bagel and my team agreed to not partake either at the risk of food poisoning. 

TLDR: Sanitation issues and was almost swindled."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2020-03-12,5.0,"If you want an authentic New York bagel, this is the place to go when in Manhattan. Friendly service, authentic, super soft, and the best bagels around hands down.  Highly recommend it"
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-03-01,1.0,"Sanitation issues! Walked into this place few weeks ago in the evening. Guy came from cleaning back kitchen holding a very dirty towel. He placed it right on the cutting board where food is prepared. Then proceed to touch my food without gloves. His hands were dirty and finger nails black. I asked him to put in gloves and dispose of food he'd already prepped without gloves. He ignored me then at cash counter looked at me and sarcastically said ""God bless America"". I just paid and left as it was odd. I then threw the whole bag of food out as I was just too disgusted to eat any of it. 

I tried to contact owner about incident but he's never in so the guy is probably still there, god knows what he's doing to people's food but I won't be eating there anymore."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-04-21,5.0,"Umm wow. I've always known what I wanted a perfect bagel to taste like but rarely have I come across that ideal in my life. This is one of those times. 
Specifically for the cinnamon raisin. Perfect crunch and the outside and delectable chewiness on the inside. Was certainly fresh made, just don't know how long ago but it was slightly warm just the way a bagel should be. No they didn't heat it for me since I just wanted to taste it unadulterated. 
Hopefully other bagels aren't ruined for me now that I've tried these. 
Oh and $7 credit card minimum. Paid $2.50 for a cinnamon raisin and a sesame."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-03-03,5.0,"Best bagels in the midtown east area. Fresh, doughy and oh-so-much cream cheese. It's become our go-to place every Saturday and Sunday morning. 

I just wish they had a place to tied up my puppy outside the store that wasn't so close to the street. Would make getting my bagels in the morning so much easier."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-03-16,5.0,"I received these bagels at home. Forcefully sent to me by a good friend. They were hard and nothing visually spectacular. However I was specifically instructed to toast them. So, I sliced them through and quartered them and toasted. 
OMG. Different levels of toasting resulted in different textures. Just a warming up have a soft Kaiser style product. Medium toast was like a nice bagel - soft inside without breaking your jaws that many places pride in ( which I personally dislike) and a light crunchy crackle on the outside just like a lightly griddled lavash bread. 
And the next level of toasting to a dark golden resulted in a stronger chew and an obviously harder crackle to the shell. It wasn't a bad chew. More like a light chewy crunch 
Just added this on my list of NYC essentials 
TMI ... you say ?"
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2020-02-14,5.0,Great bagels!!!! I think is the best place for bagels around the east side in midtown
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2018-12-09,3.0,"I went in with high expectations, both because I've had some amazing bagels in NY/NJ and because of the Yelp reviews. The food doesn't match my vision at all.

I would expect the bagel to have a very specific texture, slight crunch on the outside with a chewy interior, but got the same texture as chain bagel shops around the country. Second, I'm never a fan of places serving multiple types of cuisine; I don't see gyros and bagels being similar enough to be sold together. 

The bagel as pretty good, but just not the level I was expecting. On a positive note, the jalapeño cream cheese felt like it had fresh pieces of jalapeño in it!"
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-05-28,4.0,"In the interests of full disclosure, I'm not really a bagel expert. But even I can tell bagels taste better in New York and Jumbo Bagel is probably my favorite bagel in the city so far. They have egg bagels, which I love and which some places don't have. I like their egg and cheese sandwiches too. Even when it's crowded, the wait is usually not too bad."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2020-02-09,5.0,Great bagels! Would definitely go back. The owner was very nice and gave us extra bagels.
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2018-03-19,4.0,"NY Jumbo Bagels is about a block from my brothers house, so anytime I am in the city I make sure to stop in here for a bagel before leaving town. First off, lets talk about the fact that they are open 24/7 so no matter what time of the day you can get your fresh bagel fix! This place is small, depending on the time of the day it can get quite busy, but they are so quick with the orders than you never have to wait long!

My fav option is the pumpernickel bagel with tofu scallion spread (mmmm).  They have a TON of regular cream cheese options, and three different tofu spread options for the vegan/dairy free people.  Bagels are fluffy, perfect size and priced just right.  I have never tried the coffee here, so I see almost everyone grabbing one with their order, there is also a fridge stocked with juices and water to grab with your food.  

Great, friendly staff, delicious food, a must stop if you're in the area."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-06-09,1.0,"Messes up delivery orders, takes 2 hours to deliver one bagel 2 blocks from location, laugh and joke while on the phone, do not give refunds only store credit, have zero respect for customers or people in general. Never order from this place again you will regret it entirely."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-12-30,5.0,"Best.Bagels.Ever. My must have breakfast every morning, also their iced coffee is surprisingly addicting. So sad I moved away from here. The bagels are always fresh and amazing. The sandwiches are good too but the bagels are truly amazing. They have tons of different spreads and bagel choices."
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,Couldn't have been more proud of myself for picking this joint on instinct and introducing it to my family as well. The bagels; however they make them ; are sumptuously delicious. Thank you for the incredible service. My siblings and i enjoyed it thoroughly and looking forward to eating more bagels from here.
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2019-08-03,5.0,I originally went to Ess-a-Bagel but the line was out the door and a 50 minute wait. So I decided to venture somewhere close by and found NY Jumbo. No wait and my egg bagel sandwich was just as good. I'll be coming back!
958,ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york,2017-12-07,4.0,"Love NY Jumbo bagels. I fell off the bagel wagon a few years back but eating one recently made me reminisce about just how good NY bagels are. The cinnamon raisin was dense and chewy, with a strong skin for crunch and a generous dose of raisins. I went a bit hog-wild and also tried bites of the sesame and plain. This is carbo-loading in its most perfect form. 

Also perfect were the cream cheeses. I'm generally not a fan of cream cheese (if I had to pick a perfect bagel topping, I'd go with either hummus or guacamole ... yes, I know). But the ones here were velvety smooth: I was especially partial to the brown sugar maple one, as well as the version with flecks of scallion. 

The guys behind the counter are typically gruff. They'll also make your bagel exactly how you want it: toasted, scooped, whatever. And they won't judge if your conception of the perfect bagel ends up being a total mess to eat, like the one time my boyfriend and I went with the lox, cream cheese, avocado, and sunny side egg combo. Way too sloppy. Our hands were a nightmare. 

Other things to try:
- Tabouli salad 
- Italian chicken hero"
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2020-03-13,5.0,"I had been passing by this place so many times, figured I should try it out! This spot is super spacious. Not sure if they provide WiFi here but it looks cute to work at. I ordered their special latte with dulce de leche and it did not disappoint! Also want to point out that the girl at the cashier was super friendly and was very helpful in terms of recommending me what to order. Will def be back!"
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-09-07,5.0,"Passion fruit smoothie- nice and mildly sweet very good and would get again

Small round fry ball - nice and warm. The inside is also soft and moist, very yummy.

Guava tart- warm and crunchy on the outside and just right amount of tart and sweetness inside.

The cafe is also very quite and comfortable to sit and relax as well."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-05-03,4.0,"This was a surprisingly large coffeeshop with great seating areas, WiFi and clean bathrooms. They had a pretty large coffee menu but I opted for a classic latte. It was a very middle of the road latte. Wasn't amazingly smooth but also not bitter. Watch out though...they make it scaldingly hot! I had to wait a good 15 min to start drinking.

I would probably skip their food next time. The buñuelo is a fried cheese bread. Despite that description, the flavor was quite plain. The chewy airy texture was great though! The pan de guava was also disappointing. There was barely any guava jam in it. I kept biting into it, thinking I got the wrong pastry because it took so long to reach any guava flavor. 

The best part of this place is definitely the space itself which is perfect for both working and catching up with friends."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-12-04,5.0,"Where else can you find a place that has a coffee shop that has such great Colombian flavors. Arequipe, pan de bono, guava pastries, those are all hard to find in the city the prices are fair just like any coffee place and nothing beats Colombian coffee."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-09-16,2.0,"Colleagues from Nevada, Texas..,and Oklahoma in town, and we all decided to give this place a try.

    NO Sandwich options!! 
    Not a single Sandwich in the entire Café. 

They have their own brand of Espresso and House selections of coffee..,and plenty of choices of  Muffins...,Scones.., Cookies...,Bagels...,Croissant's to choose from...,however NO Sandwich choices.  

      I picked the French Spinach Quiche, and I'll give it a 6.5 rating. The crust could have been better..., and it had to much cayenne pepper. 

    Ambiance = 10
       The interior design was phenomenal! Great for a date..,and walk to Central Park a few blocks away.  It looks like they spent time in the interior design of the place.., however NO Sandwich choices. 

     Staff = 10
      They speak to you immediately when you walk into the Café..,have eye contact, have knowledge on products..., however NO Sandwich choices."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-08-26,4.0,"I read Ruggy's review and decided to head to Juan Valdez Cafe because  I was looking for a place to settle down and use internet for a few hours. The wi-fi is strong and I had no issue using it on my iPhone as well as my laptop. I was curious about the coffee since many people seem to like it a lot, but I went for the fruppe instead because I came right after a workout and was craving something cold. Small mango fruppe was just the right size to cool me down and it wasn't overly sweet either. 

Apparently many people know about this place and it was fairly crowded, but with some available seats. Music and the talking is loud, but if you're sick of working at home or some other place, this is a good place to come for a new environment."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-09-22,3.0,"So disappointing. 
Came here specifically for good coffee and studying.
The Wi-Fi code is on the receipt. Internet wasn't working even tough they said it was.
Coffee was okay.
Not my kind of atmosphere but that part was mostly me."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2020-01-29,5.0,Awesome place in nyc but dang that coffee is strong. Perfect for a quick bite/coffee and the place is one of the most spacious in NYC that I've seen!
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2020-02-07,5.0,Beautiful zen place to wind down or before work. Feels like you're in Colombia (even though I've never been there) Delicious coffee and good service. Luckily this gem is right next to where I work making it my daily morning routine before I hit the grind.
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2020-02-21,4.0,I kept meaning to go into this place but it was always in a hurry I remember the blonde Valdez commercials from my childhood so this intrigued me what a cute place very clean I love the decor I had a cortado espresso with leche condensada and a dulce de leche sandwich cookie it was good it was not that overpriced it's New York prices it's clean it's yummy in my opinion there quicker than Starbucks and they do have a very menu I'm going to go back and try some of the other yummy's and take more time to enjoy it it's worth the visit pastries small snack food and all types of beverages coffee and otherwise
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-09-18,5.0,"Every time I sip my cold brew I can't help but say ""wow so good.""

959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-06-07,5.0,"This coffee shop stood out for their focus on Colombian coffee and creative drink options.  I'm a sucker for anything I've never had before and I tried the Peach-Chipotle nevado, which is a flavored iced coffee with whipped cream.  It was delicious, with a good, rounded coffee flavor, not to sweet, not too spicy, and not too peachy; it was well-balanced.  

I like their wood floor and wall and spent a good chunk of time at the bar facing the street, which has plenty of outlets.  I also got several coffee items to take home from their retail area.  It was nice to be somewhere that wasn't just the same standards over and over."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-12-26,4.0,"The cafe is spacious, with a fair amount of seating and tables. I would recommend this cafe for anyone looking to do work or study. It's conveniently located, but not overcrowded like other coffee shops in the area. There is also a secured WiFi code on the receipt with relatively stable connection. Happy to see a broad list of non-coffee items (personally, not a coffee drinker). The hot Chai Latte was quite good and not overly sweet!"
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-07-11,4.0,"This cafe is so cute! I stumbled upon it on my back from work and it is surprisingly huge for a coffee shop. They have free wifi and tons of seating so it's great if you want a quiet study spot or a place to get work done away form the hustle and bustle. The staff is also always super friendly and helpful, which is an added bonus.

I love their coffee, which is super strong and really gets you that caffeine fix. But don't get me started on their oreo cheesecake!! I have to stop myself from going to the cafe sometimes because I always end up with a slice of cheesecake whenever I go. It is sooo delicious not to mention very reasonably priced.

All in all, if you're looking for a quiet and not a cramped looking coffee shop to retreat to, I highly recommend checking out JVC"

Add the fact that the prices are decent for the area, it's a great spot to get your work done or catch up with friends (just don't be too loud as most people here looked to be studying). The baristas were really friendly and looked like they didn't hate their jobs. 4/5"
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-03-08,5.0,"Study spots are definitely hard to come by in NYC, and JVC is gold. The Colombian coffee focus means that the roasts are toasty and smooth. There's also a lot of interesting variants here you won't find at other cafes... Cafe Con Cardamom, their special iced coffee with orange and cinnamon. 

The high ceiling, warm lighting, and rainforest decor makes the space feel wide open. 

Easy to connect WIFI, accessible outlets, and a restroom (codes for these you get with your receipt). 

High recommended."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-05-24,4.0,"The coffee here is pretty good. There are lots of seating options including couch, table chair, stool etc. I've been here a few times with my dying laptop and was able to find an outlet to plug it into. Pictured is the cheesecake but the carrot cake is better. They sometimes keep it in the fridge in the back, so if a staff member temporarily leaves the counter when you've ordered cake, it's to go get a refrigerated piece of cake. The plates are flimsy paper plates. Nice curvy wall to the front of the coffeeshop."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-09-16,4.0,I got their sweet corn arepa w/ queso and their passion fruit smoothie.  I really liked both and the interior is a change from another Starbucks or coffee shop in Manhattan because of the Latin flair.  The customer service was good minus some slight communication barrier.
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2020-02-18,5.0,"Satisfyingly gorgeous, a novel menu, a transport of imagery. Quiet enough to focus. Easy to imagine you have slipped through a hedge warp to another city altogether."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-10-14,4.0,"Cool Colombian coffee spot that is fairly priced and has good selection. Best of all on a slowish Saturday I was able to post up and utilize free WiFi and they were cool with it, as most cafes are. Workers are kind and bathrooms are clean, good place for a coffee with an out of town visitor or even for someone living in the city. Would recommend!"
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-01-18,3.0,"I would not expect to find such a nice cafe in such an unusual area - 57th bw 3rd & Lex, but here it is.  It's a nice, large space with high ceilings and lots of seating. They also have lots of interesting coffee-prep options.

I came here on a random Tuesday afternoon to meet a colleague, who I had not seeing in a while, for coffee, but the place was packed.  Most people seemed to come in with their laptops and books and camp out here.  I had to watch any movement in the hopes that someone was getting up so that we could get two seats.  Luckily, two people who were clearly strangers to each other got up within 2 minutes of each other from a 2-seater area, and I snagged it.  But almost lost one chair when another patron wanted to take it, but I told him that I was expecting someone.

Anyway, if you come here with more than just yourself and hope for a seat, be prepared to wait or be disappointed.  Otherwise, the coffee was good and it was a nice place."

Then again, I love coffee, will always love and can drink coffee at any time of the day or night and even with my love for coffee, their brew was great, flavorful with wonderful textures.  I only drink regular brewed hot or cold coffee (never any macchiatos, lattes, etc) so this review is based on their coffee only"
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2018-07-09,2.0,"There's a reason why I'll always be a loyal Starbucks customer. 

I've been here numerous times but lately I realized how bad the service has become. By that I mean slooowww and super inefficient. The lady at counter was taking her time as the line grew.

Not to mention, she had apparently forgotten my order (after I asked about it). 

The tired people were in need of their caffeine, the lifeblood of busy New Yorkers and they simply weren't getting it in timely fashion. 

I am giving stars for the interesting cozy ambience and creative, spacious, seating areas. 

Other than that, Juan Valdez is a clear No bueno for me."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-09-04,4.0,Cute cafe!! Stopped by with my friend before hopping on the bus wondering if they had smoothies and they did! I didn't need my caffeine fix at that time but will try their Colombian coffee next time as well their other pastries as they looked really goood. The workers were super friendly as we both waited patiently for our blackberry fruppe with water. I also got a cranberry cake and my friend got a brownie. The cafe was also very spacious as I didn't expect it to be from the outside - it was pretty full at that time around 4:30pm. Maybe I'll stay for a bit next time before hopping on the bus too!
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2020-01-20,3.0,Nice place but the coffee was not very tasty and service was meh. Plenty of tables and seating.
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2018-05-26,5.0,"This place is great for either working or catching up with a friend. 
There are plenty of tables and mellow music in the background."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2018-12-20,5.0,"Best place to relax and sip on a hot cup of coffee or a hot chocolate.

The place is pretty big and spacious, making it ideal for me to read a book and work on my laptop

JVC is my go to place if I need to work over a coffee"
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2020-01-18,5.0,"Wait!!! Hand fresh ground cardamom coffee?!? YES, that's  what Nicolas did today, and it was amazing! Such a great cafe, location and venue. Love this place, the coffee and the service!
The only thing they need here is sandwiches and I'd be herE more often, and I think other people would as well."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2018-10-13,4.0,"Plenty of seating, it's great place to work,  clean and the drinks are rich with flavor (great if you like coffee)

I usually come here, when I need to do work or update my resume. I never have an issue finding a seat, there's WiFi and a bathroom too. The WiFi is stronger if you're seated in the back. I assume that's where their route is. 

Environment: there aren't real trees in there, but the wall paper has trees on it.

 It's not a bad place to hangout with friends too. 

Decent amount of seating in front and more in the back.  Good for small and big groups. Lighting is brighter in the front, more dim in the back."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2018-01-21,5.0,"I have been in need of a good coffee shop to get work done, and I finally found one I love!  First off my Medium (quite large) Americano was only $3.10, which by NYC standards is cheap.  It was also very rich and delicious.  AAaaand, I handed her $4 in cash, she felt bad I didn't have a dime and gave me the dollar back.  

The atmosphere is a very lovely and roomy.  I could hangout in here for hours.  I think my only complaint is they stream music that has commercials. The walls are covered in South American rain forest scenery, with cool tables and ambient light fixtures. This is by far one of my favorite coffee shops in NYC."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-05-20,5.0,Found this place via Yelp. More than coffee I prefer a good ambience for study or a casual chat. This place offers best of both. Amidst the busy new York traffic and crowd it gives a safe haven to clear your mind.  Excellent coffee and baristas. Loved their arepa. #work #latte #arepa
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-04-26,5.0,"Once you drink Juan Valdez you'll forget all about Starbucks. To my fellow Colombians in NYC, this gem looks like an exact replica of all other Juan Valdez Cafe's in Colombia (including quality of taste). I came here for the first time this week and was super happy although I wish there were more in Manhattan. To anyone whose heard of JV and hasn't tried it... DO SO, to anyone in the area... TRY ITT."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2017-12-02,1.0,"My dad liked his strong coffee.

Maybe I chose terribly, but my coffee was so bad that I had to throw it out.

The space is nicely decorated but a bit sparse. I don't see this as coffee shop you'd pop in to work or meet friends."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2018-07-07,5.0,"Best coffee ever!!!!
Loved it, true Colombian COFFEE perfecto for your morning Java...
Amazing Idea and it really works
They should have one in every corner"
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2018-11-20,2.0,"I've long professed a fondness for Juan Valdez's chai latte and chocolate chip muffin, as well as the fact that it's one of the few cafes in the citiy with ample seating and space to spread out. There was one time where I tried a toasted pan de guava and it was seriously the highlight of my week. I've seen people come in and order five of those things at a time so don't just take my word for it. 

But the line to order coffee and food is crazy-slow sometimes, especially given how many people behind the counter. I'm not sure if a lot of it comes down to miscommunication but on my last visit, ordering a latte took about 15 minutes with only three people before me. #firstworldproblems, I know, but it was kind of frustrating to watch someone meticulously sort change him three people were trying to make eye contact with him. That's another thing. Lord help you if you need to ask where your drink is or where you could get an extra straw. There's a lot of scurrying and averted glances but drinks and food came out at a snail's pace. On other visits, the baristas were engaged in these super drawn-out conversations and chit chat with people waiting for their drinks while a line grew - it was only when the customer decided to stop talking that they realized, whoops, other people were standing there. 

I'd still come back all the time because it's so close to me but the service is a bummer, especially given that there's usually 5-6 people working at a time so it's not as though they're swamped."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-08-27,4.0,"Pros: it's hard to find a cafe where you can easily grab a seat, and this place has plenty of space. The cardamom coffee is awesome (if it's your thing... if you're a fan of Turkish coffee you'd enjoy this). They don't charge me extra to put almond milk in my coffee. Salted caramel cheesecake tastes nothing like salted caramel, but is delicious nonetheless.

Cons: though the decor is interesting, it lacks the cozy factor that cafes tend to have. This could be a midtown problem though, and not a fault of the business."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2018-12-08,5.0,"Great place to study or chat over coffee. WiFi available (password needed) and outlets are present near a long table in the back, but are a bit far if you sit in the middle so bring a longer cord if you plan on settling down for an afternoon."
959,juan-valdez-cafe-new-york,2019-08-22,5.0,"Great coffee and they do offer some authentic Colombian snacks, which was pleasantly surprising. I wish they had outlets by the windows"
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2020-05-27,5.0,"The employees are wonderful. It is a diner. I LOVE diners. I used to go often but, of course, not now. They just opened for take out. TAKE OUT! Keep them in business. xoxoxo"
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2020-06-07,4.0,"Hey, I'm i. Quarantine with my BF and we ordered from John's randomly yesterday. The beef and turkey burgers were really good and the onion rings were crispy even after a delivery! I'll get pics next time, that food didn't stand a chance. Lol, thanks!"
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-06-30,4.0,"Homey clean coffee shop, great food for breakfast and lunch. John's has been a mainstay for many years in a nabe where good diners are few and far between. 
Booths are small but comfy enough. I love their perfectly prepared crispy breakfast potatoes, a cut above the oily mess other places serve up. Servers are generally quick and friendly. Personal breakfast fave is their California omelette with avocado, cheese and tomato. They offer multigrain toast on the side if you're keeping it healthy. Free refills on beverages. 
Tip: John's is not an option for late night munchies as they close at 3:00 on weekends and 7:00 weekdays."
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-12-15,5.0,"My husband and I stopped in before our flight home. It's a nice, no frills diner which is exactly what we wanted after a long weekend in the city. The coffee was really good. Service was very fast and friendly. Not much to say about it. It's the sort of place you don't need to overthink. If you want simple breakfast fare at a decent price, this is a good place for it."
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-03-31,4.0,"Standard coffee shop fare with the breakfast I ordered (Sausage, scrambled eggs, hash browns and toast) prepared and in front of me very quickly.  I sat at the bar and the service was curt but not in a mean way.  Just in a not chatty way.

The food was good, there was some Chalupa hot sauce to shake on and add some spice and best of all, the coffee was strong, really good and my cup was kept warmed up while I ate.

Very efficient operation with decent food served fast in a clean looking environment.  Pretty much checks the boxes you need checked for a quick coffee shop meal."
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-11-03,5.0,"11/2/19 Small at-home breakfast spot with great food, and great prices. We had a small wait of around 10 minutes, but I'd wait an hour for the food/service. The place is clean and no frills. Service was perfect! We were SLIGHTLY pressured to leave a while after we were done with breakfast, but it's understandable because the line of people waiting was growing, and it is a small spot!"
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-08-03,2.0,"Service felt rushed. Was charged for coffee that allegedly was supposed to be included in their brunch special but as I was in a rush, I decided not to question the extra $3

The cashier had the audacity to look at the tip screen upon checkout to make sure I tipped the waiter which I found quite off-putting. I tipped anyway as all of their staff appeared to be hard-working Latinos"
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-09-29,4.0,"I enjoyed John's.

Food was good.

Service was quick.

The only reason I deducted anything at all is that we felt very rushed.  I understand that we're taking table space, and that there is a fairly steady stream of people coming in there, but asking us for our order 3 times within 2 minutes of sitting down was a bit much.

Would definitely still go back.  But they could ease up just a hair."
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-11-12,5.0,"In NYC by myself so I booked a tour of the UN. You have to arrive early and you can't be late so I made sure I had some extra time. Now  my perception is NYC has awesome diners so I searched one near the UN. I found Johns coffee shop. I'm glad I did. 
The food was awesome. Some of the best hash browns I've ever eaten. And I'm a picky hash brown eater. The eggs and toast were great and 5 pieces of crispy bacon!!!   Delish!
It was too busy when I came in so I didn't feel any pressure to leave. But it did get much busier. Lots of to go orders. 
If you can sit at the counter near the cook and watch a master at work. Man he can cook. And fast OMG. Seriously fast.
Service was super and so was the coffee. 
I recommend this place for a true NYC dinner"
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-11-03,5.0,Excellent place for breakfast! Met our friends for brunch. We had omelets and bacon and eggs. The coffees was delicious and hot. If you are in the area I highly recommend due to the fast and friendly service and yummy food!
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-07-10,5.0,"Came here while on vacation in NYC. I was looking for a diner near my hotel and a couple options came up, so glad I decided to go with this place! The food and service was off the charts! I ordered pancakes, eggs and bacon and if I could fit more food in my stomach I would have ordered another helping. The price was cheaper than I expected too for the quality of food served. The staff was friendly and talked to me until my food came, I also ran into another family from Minnesota that was visiting. My only regret was not eating here sooner as I discovered this place on my last day in NYC. Will definitely be back next year though!"
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-06-27,4.0,This is the place to go for good breakfast or brunch! My omelet was cooked perfectly and they let me have berries instead of potatoes and toast. Hubby's breakfast sandwich on a bagel was tasty and fresh. Highly recommend!
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-12-28,5.0,Good ole breakfast every time. Love to sit at the attached chairs at the bar and have eggs and bacon in the morning!
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-08-14,5.0,Very nice NYC diner. Really great coffee and food at a great price point. All the food is fresh and seasoned well. I usually pop in and get a coffee with an egg and cheese bagel.

960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-03-20,3.0,Midtown Coffee Shop. Clean nice decor. Friendly staff.  Open kitchen.  He got his egg white omelette and turkey bacon 4 minutes before I got my french toast.........He said his food was good.
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-10-03,4.0,This diner was around the corner from my hotel in New York City my last tripi ate there times and each time my breakfast was perfect and the service was excellent and the price was in line with all the other diners in New York City. I wish I could say the same for comfort diner which was across the street from the Wyndham where I stayed. I gave comfort diner two chances and they blew each one of them. If you're staying close to the Wyndham in New York City on 45th and third walk the extra few feet to this restaurant and avoid the comfort diner
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-09-02,5.0,"Visiting NY for the week and found this diner Gem via Yelp. Reviews were good and it did not disappoint. The menu is traditional Greek diner fare. I ordered the Lumberjack breakfast which includes pancakes, eggs, meat and hash brown potatoes. I picked the chicken sausage and it was delicious. It had a little sweetness (maybe a hint of maple) and was browned just right. I added blueberries to my pancakes which was a great choice as they were also delicious. The cakes were large and fluffy so be prepared to leave some behind because the portion size is a challenge to get through. Service was good and food was delivered fast even with a full house. Would definitely stop in again next time I'm in town."
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-10-28,5.0,absolutely amazing!! I go to school right down the street and I found my new favorite spot. Everything came out super fast and very delicious too. Prices are probably the best part considering I am a college student. Definitely will be back! Thank you!!
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-07-06,5.0,"I had about 45 min before picking up a family member at Penn Station. It was not a lot of time but enough to want something more than fast food. Fortunately, I found John's. One of my favorite things to do when visiting NYC is to stumble upon an unexpectedly delightful restaurant. Service was excellent, I got seated right away.  I chose breakfast. It was nothing fancy but completely hit the spot.  I recommend John's highly if you want a quick, quality meal."
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-09-08,1.0,"Good delivery spot for breakfast sandwiches but the coffee always arrives spilled when delivered, and this one delivery guy they use is AGGRESSIVE as hell when knocking on the door. You would think he thought he was police by the way he bangs on the front door. That alone is enough for me to just order somewhere else.

I used to always order from here but I can't get over how annoying this old delivery man is. Nothing special, it's dinner food. 

You guys might need new staff."
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2020-01-02,5.0,Great coffee shop with reasonable prices for the area. Staff is attentive and professional. Food is served quick and very good. Their pancakes are delicious and fluffy.

960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-03-17,5.0,Fun little diner to have breakfast at. Service was supper fast. Prices were reasonable.
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2017-11-30,5.0,"This is my go-to diner on both on seamless and in person and I hope it stays in the neighborhood forever! The food is your typical diner food, it's not expensive, the service is efficient and true to their name, the coffee is quite good! They use fresh beans and the coffee doesn't skew acidic or bitter so will appeal to all palates; if you are dining in, they will refill your coffee cup as many times as you want throughout your meal. 

I really love the lumberjack plates here, which are pancakes with eggs and sausage, but will go for specials whenever they're available. Recently, I discovered that they do a brunch special on weekends and holiday, which means your meal comes with coffee or tea and juice or fruit salad. For a place that have huge breakfasts for $13, this is a really good deal. I've tried the fall seasonal specials - pumpkin spice pancake, and a waffle with spiced apples, walnuts, and raisins - and found them to  be a fun detour from your usual diner food. 

All in all, will be continuing my visits here!"
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-07-10,5.0,Great place for breakfast! We had free breakfast in our hotel and chose to eat here instead. Great service and good hot food!

Sat at the counter as usual for an always solid breakfast. Everyone who works there, from the owners to the chef who's going 100mph churning out meals, are pleasant and welcoming.  Been coming to John's for at least 4 years now and have never had a bad breakfast or an unpleasant experience. Keep it up guys!!"

Will most definitely be frequenting!!"
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2019-07-22,5.0,We ate here on Saturday and Sunday.  The restaurant was full but we did not have to wait long for a table.  My kids loved the pancakes and the egg dishes are delicious.  The service is fast and friendly.

960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2017-10-15,4.0,"Pancakes were great as was the tuna melt. Prices are fair and the service fast. If you're hungover and looking for some good diner food to get you back up and running, Johns is definitely worth it!!
Will be back"
960,johns-coffee-shop-new-york-8,2018-10-10,5.0,This is more than a breakfast place. Just had an outstanding dinner at a fair price. Try anything with their Feta cheese. It is unbelievably flavorful! The Red Velvet Cake was just like my Mom used to make. (Maybe better?).

Small spot, sit wherever you please and service is fast and efficient. We ordered and about 6 minutes later our food was on the table. We ordered the standard eggs, potatoes, toast, and pancakes. We really loved our breakfast! It was hot, fresh, and tasty. Potatoes were really delicious. Pancakes were subpar for my pancake tastebuds but that doesn't stop me from giving them five stars.

Great prices for great food! Overall it was a great experience and we will be returning here in the future."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2020-02-09,5.0,"Donna Bell's Bake Shop is a real gem. The fresh-made lunches and desserts are so good, and the people who work here are absolutely lovely. Really a great staff.

In the winter, their soups are my absolute favorite comfort food, and they come with a piece of biscuit/bread on the side. (Note: there's no indoor seating, so plan to take it to go.) In the summer, you can take your meal down the block to eat at the plaza (where there's occasionally live music). 

Word to the wise: since they make everything fresh here, they do close early in the afternoon/evening if they sell out. But I think that's how a bakery should be run. Also, I'm not as big a fan of their breakfast sandwiches as I am their lunch menu. But their lunch offerings are amazing.

I recommend you check out Donna Bell's if you haven't. It's a really special place in the city and, I think, the best lunch spot in the area."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2020-01-11,5.0,"A Midtown miracle. Amid a sea of Starbucks and corporate restaurants, this hole-in-the-wall bakery sells homemade, delicious, and unique baked goods that for one minute lets you forget about the New York rush. 

The blueberry scones, the breakfast sandwiches, the less-frequently offered banana bread and/or muffins...pretty much everything that comes out of this place is incredible. And even though it's not a coffee shop per se, the coffee is solid and a nice complement to the food.

Side note for those who've never been here before: there's no seating inside but on warm days you can sit and eat in the little plaza half a block west between 49th & 50th Streets."

961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-11-03,4.0,"Cute little bake shop in Midtown. I have a friend that lives on the same block so this is now our breakfast spot. We went twice this weekend! The biscuits are fluffy, buttery and delicious! I had the thick cut ham, egg and cheese which was really good, but tbh I would have loved bacon on it. The coffee is their own roast but they add chicory coffee to it from Cafe Du Monde in NOLA. It's a tiny shop so don't expect to eat there. Grab your biscuit and take a lovely stroll to the park."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-07-13,3.0,"3/5 because 
The food is almost really good but falls short of it 

Considering the space they have they make a lot of items and they aren't half bad 

It arrived reasonably quickly (only one employee at the time) 
The place is clean
Tiny sized seating area, space for maybe 4 people, but a large outdoor space feet away make up for it

Cute interior design matches the food 
The service is friendly   
The quality that you get is above average when factoring price but not enough for me to go back

It's somewhere I'd want to go again but the the breakfast sandwich just didn't do it

The biscuit thing itself was amazingly tasty, what killed it was the egg and cheese, the cheese was simple, not that good, but the egg, it had this weird plastic like film on it that I actually mistook for plastic because I couldn't bite through it, I don't know how that came to be but it wasn't edible and tasted weird, scrambled eggs would've been messy yes, but probably better 

The lemon cake was ok, not great, not bad, I ate most of it 

I don't regret coming here, I want to come back, they have potential, but the recipe isn't there just yet I think"
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-06-09,5.0,"Stopped in one day when I was coming out of Just Salads and one day my co workers thought it would be good to go in. They have scones, cookies, and a lot of different bake shop items. I am never one to choose a scone but I had one of these with my coworkers and omg this scone is to die for! I love the raspberry scone. You can ask them to heat it up and they are really great. They have huge chocolate cookies and biscuits-- some cheesy and some regular. 

I've  ever tired but they do have breakfast and lunch and it's more like biscuit sandwiches for both breakfast and lunch. Definitely a hidden gem in this tourist trap corporate theatre district."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-04-24,4.0,"Some of my fondest childhood memories with my favorite family members revolve around Easter & Easter candy, & birthdays celebrated with homemade strawberry cake. Image my child-like delight at finding Peeps marshmallow bunny-topped strawberry cupcakes at Donna Bell's Bake Shop just a couple days before Easter. A whimsical treat that took me down memory lane via my tastebuds. 

Had we wanted a more substantial snack, I suspect we would've knocked out our hunger by sharing a Cheddar Biscuit, which looked absolutely enticing. Alas, I'll have to wait til next time to see if Donna Bell's can conjure up anymore lovely memories with their savories. If I'm ever awake early enough (doubtful!), I'll come by for a Breakfast Sandwich made with their homemade biscuits because I hear they are, indeed, worth waking up for.

Side note: There are a few cramped window seats that are decorated with adorable pillows, but for the most part, customers eat their goodies standing up outside of the bake shop."

961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-08-15,2.0,"Used to be a favorite years ago. Had to wait far too long today for my breakfast biscuit, which perhaps explains why the egg was cooked solidly through. Ugh. Never used to be like this. Who the heck in New York doesn't want a runny or at least soft egg on their breakfast sandwich? Gross, especially for five bucks. Also the biscuit disintegrated in my hand as I tried to eat it. I'd have been happier with a bodega bacon egg and cheese. Probably off my list now."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-07-18,5.0,"The best scone I've ever had. Maybe because it was more biscuit-y (sooo buttery) than most scones, but wow it's delicious. I got the blueberry scone with orange glaze the other day and have been craving it again ever since. The scone is huge for the price (about $3) and it's a perfect afternoon pick me up if you work in midtown. Definitely a grab and go kind of place though!"
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2018-06-17,4.0,"Craving a hearty biscuit sandwich for breakfast and this is where I found myself. You walk in this tiny storefront and they have a case filled with pastries and a sign promoting their $5 Egg and Cheese sandwiches with your choice of meat. 
Exceeded size expectations (some photos looked smaller) and the biscuit was one of the best. The Egg is hard boiled in the shape of a flat,round patty which I found totally bizarre, and the only knock I have on this sandwich"
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2018-06-06,3.0,"Saw the reviews raving about the biscuit breakfast sandwich so since this is my last week in this area, I figured why not?
Tip 1: You will smell like oily food despite only being inside the store for less than 5 minutes

I ordered a biscuit sandwich without the cheese (lactose is not my friend anymore). It came wrapped in aluminum foil and inside a paper bag.

Yeah the egg is boiled which makes me feel that it's a bit healthier. But how healthy can the rest of the sandwich be when it's a biscuit (that soaks up the juices from the sausage patty on top and it's a bit toasted). The biscuit was good for sure and melted in my mouth. That's about it. Maybe next time I'll just buy a biscuit instead of the whole sandwich.

They also had other desserts but it was too early for sweets. I'm a savory breakfast type of gal."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2018-11-29,4.0,"O M G. This place's baked goods are D E L I C I O U S.

1. This place is tiny. Don't come here and expect to be able to eat your delicious breakfast sandwich or pastry in here.
2. Do you watch NCIS? Because Abby from NCIS (aka Pauley Perrette) is good friends with the owner of this place. Makes me love it even more since I love NCIS.
3. This place's hours are probably wrong.. They run out of baked goods all the time when I walk past it after work and when they do, they close early!

I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here unless you come in the morning otherwise you run the risk of the store being out of pastries already.. BUT their biscuits are so buttery and good. Their other sweet pastries also look soooo good, though I haven't tried most of them. I love that I live close by and can't wait to eat more of the items here."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-06-06,4.0,"Scones for dayyyys!! Nice selection-seasonal berry ones are quite delicious.  Cinnamon one very good. Biscuit and biscuit sandwiches yummy. I really want to try their biscuits and gravy, but they dont have everyday."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-01-10,4.0,"We were in NYC for a few days and stopped in here one morning to grab a breakfast sandwich. It was farther from our hotel than other options and I came here specifically because the Yelp reviews were so good. 

Yelpers, you did not disappoint. I got the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit sandwich and my husband got the veggie patty version ($5 each - you can't beat the price). I got an orange juice and my husband got coffee. Total was around $16. 

The biscuits are best described as a lot of butter loosely held together by a little bit of flour - and I mean that in the best way possible. The biscuit was delicious and the fillings were standard fare. I would not/could not eat this everyday as I would probably die of a butter-induced heart attack. :) 

The kitchen was fast with the food, so no complaints there. It is not a sit-down place so come prepared to get your food and go. The place is tiny but seemed clean. 

This would have been a five-star review except for the woman working the counter. She was the definition of dead eyes and no facial expression at all. She forgot to grab my juice and didn't even say a word when I reminded her when we got our food. I really think she would not have cared at all if I had walked out without my complete order. She had the air of someone who really hates their job, and that is too bad since I liked everything else about Donna Bell's."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-02-02,4.0,"Our go-to spot for breakfast on the weekend. The breakfast sandwiches come on a delicious buttery biscuit and they have a rotating menu of protein options. Considering how big and delicious the biscuit is, $5 is a good deal.

All of the baked goods are delicious as well. This morning I had a banana scone with an orange glaze. The scone was perfectly crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and the glaze was not too sweet.

Only knocking off 1 star because the hours and menu are hard to predict. They rotate through the items they have in store so you never know if your favorite will be there and often run out of items so their closing time varies."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-04-23,5.0,"I haven't had anything besides the scones, but I've sampled the blueberry, banana, cinnamon, chocolate and almond and now the blackberry. I mean, I've started and stopped writing this multiple times so I can grab another bite of it. Hold please. Scone quality and texture can be seriously varied, but these are firm enough to dunk into coffee (absolutely do) but flaky like biscuits. Speaking of. Hold please. I also bought this pimento cheese biscuit for tomorrow morning. I'm branching out. Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta get back to this scone. It's friggin' delicious."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2018-10-23,3.0,"I'd recommend Donna Bell's over many chain stores in a heartbeat. Price wise it's about the same ($5), but you definitely get more bang for your buck here. I was pleasantly surprised about the size of the breakfast sandwich and the speed with which it was prepared. No doubt everything is pre-cooked and assembled to order, which I don't mind. However, I would sacrifice some of the speed for a properly heated breakfast sandwich - the cheese wasn't even melted on mine.

This is definitely a grab-and-go type of place, as there is probably enough seating for 2 people total. 

If you know where to go, it doesn't beat the price and taste of a classic NYC bagel with egg+cheese+meat of your choosing. Given the fact that you're likely in Times Square and options are limited, Donna Bell's isn't a bad choice."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-06-07,5.0,Fantastic scones. I was craving something sweet and found the place. It was surprising inexpensive and a decent sized scone. Would totally drop by again in the future to satisfy my random baked goods craving!
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-12-06,4.0,"This place is like a country bakery in the middle of NYC.  They sell out almost every day, and at that time the put a ""sold out"" sign on the door and close.  That goes to show you that things are fresh.  I have tried several things.  I know that their biscuit sandwiches are popular, but it was a bit too heavy for me.  However, a friend who loves biscuits loved it.
Their cupcakes are better than the trendy NYC tourist traps like Magnolia or Butter Cup Bakery.  The frosting is not too sweet and the cake is much more flavorful and moist than those mentioned.  My favorites at this place are their cookies.  Delicious chocolate chip cookies, and, my favorite, the lemon iced cookies."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2018-06-20,5.0,"The 808 in NYC!!  

Ordered the sausage biscuit breakfast sandwich, 1 strawberry scone, and 1 cinnamon scone to go.  The sausage biscuit was very savory and the biscuit itself was buttery (a bit too buttery/greasy for me). I like biscuits that are a bit more firm, but over all the sandwich was good. The egg was a bit over (yolk very well done), but it could have been because I waited about 10 minutes to eat it due to the temperature. 

Both the strawberry scone and the cinnamon scone was coated with a sugar glaze that added to the flavor. The texture was perfect (harder/semi-crisp edges with a soft interior).  Would have been great with a cup of joe that I decided not to get (wanted to get some sleep after the 9 1/2 hour flight). 

Our server was awesome. Had a lot of suggestions and did not rush us at all. He even said aloha when we told him we were from Hawaii. He was personable, friendly, and had the aloha spirit!  

Oh yah- My son also ordered a lemonade. Sweet with a tangy finish- yum!! 

All in all a great experience."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-07-23,5.0,I'm a big fan of the $5 breakfast sandwich (ham and cheese for me!). It's delicious and comes on a homemade biscuit. Can't beat it!
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2018-05-06,5.0,"Never had an egg and cheese sandwich quite like this. This giant turkey egg and cheese I had was only $5 and it was great. Super melty cheese,with egg and turkey served and the softest and fluffiest biscuit. The biscuit was obviously the star. It crumbled at the softest touch. Didn't get any of their sweets but I will def be back for another biscuit sandwich and a sweet treat. All the baked good are made on site so you can be sure you're getting the freshest things. If you want a breakfast sandwich I would check the time because they don't sell them all day!"
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-08-18,2.0,"I was very disappointed after seeing some photos of this (seemingly) delicious baked goods on Instagram. SEC Biscuit was very bland, and as someone else wrote, the egg had a plasticy (or maybe papery) film on it which I'm still convinced was actually an inedible object. Coffee is also watery. Manager seems like he hates his life. I say don't bother - plenty of great bakeries and street vendors in the area to support."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2018-04-14,5.0,"Okay these biscuit sandwiches are really as good as everyone says. I was so happy when I took it out of the bag and realized how hefty of a sandwich it was. First of all, they're $5 and they're ENORMOUS. I was thinking like a normal biscuit maybe the size of a McDonald's one. Nope, these are probably the size of a bagel. I ordered it with the turkey thinking they'd be slices of sandwich turkey, but these are legitimate slices of turkey from like thanksgiving dinner. The egg is kind of like a hard boiled egg, which I thought was a little odd because I was expecting a fried egg, but I'm not complaining whatsoever. It was absolutely delicious. 

There's no room for seating inside, so definitely be prepared to take your order to go and eat it somewhere you can be a little messy."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2018-11-14,5.0,"Walked in looking for a treat for my hard to please kid. It was 30 min before close and they had a bunch of chocolate chip cookies and a few scones and Rice Krispie treats left. My son wasn't interested but I bought a CC cookie because they were huge and I felt bad walking in not buying anything. The cookie was the best one I have ever had. Stuff dreams are made of... please hit this place up. It's small, there are no seats but it's worth it for this cookie. Amazing!"
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-04-07,5.0,"5-star breakfast biscuits!  Glorious fresh from scratch biscuits (as good as any in NC, SC, AL or GA), sausage spot-on, fresh eggs, cheese.  Not too salty (which is the bane of the breakfast biscuit).  Generous portion too.  Also 5-star scones and banana bread.  Our whole family loved this place."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-05-31,3.0,"Walked in on a whim one afternoon, looking for a snack and a drink. The homemade lemonade is delicious - refreshing with just a hint of tartness that explodes on the tongue. I asked the person behind the counter his opinion on one of the scones and he seemed a bit dismissive about it and just said everything was delicious. I've had better opinions on baked goods at other bakeries and restaurants like finding out what the bestsellers are, what a staff member's personal favorite was, etc. ended up getting a banana scone with orange glaze. The texture and consistency was fine but I barely tasted the banana. The overpowering flavor was definitely the orange glaze. I'd go back to try another scone, maybe, but it was an okay experience and choice this time around."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2018-11-20,5.0,"We had the homemade biscuit, egg, cheese and sausage. The egg was fresh and the biscuit was amazing.  We also got the cinnamon scone which was flavored thru out and soft in the right spots"
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2018-07-24,4.0,Came here one morning when I was craving egg. I got the sausage egg and cheese sandwich. It was pretty good. I enjoyed it. I think the only downside being the egg is hardboiled so some parts of it had a weird texture but it was still good to me !
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-12-18,5.0,Sweet biscuits are absurd! They are sweet like a muffin with the richness and texture of a southern biscuit.
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-03-03,4.0,"Breakfast biscuit sandwich is outstanding. Love the taste of the biscuit, crumbly, buttery, yummy. I had the sausage egg & cheese. Also had a strawberry scone which was the best scone I've ever tasted."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2017-07-03,2.0,"Woulda.  Coulda.  Shoulda:

These three words kept echoing in my head after my experience here. Because the Cheddar Pimiento Biscuit I tried lacked flakiness and was underbaked. And an Orange-Cranberry Corn Muffin had zero citrus flavor and was similarly doughy. Neither even came close to the deliciousness I saw portrayed on Cooking Channel show, Unique Sweets.  Hubby wasn't into the gummy texture of the filling in his Lemon Bar either.  

And here's the thing. I woulda, coulda, shoulda gone to nearby Bibble & Sip instead.  I passed up an opportunity to indulge in a delectable Earl Grey or Matcha Cream Puff for this?  Sigh.

All of this being said, since it seems like the Breakfast Sandwich is the thing here, I'd be willing to return and try one of those.  Though it'll be tough to resist the pull of Bibble & Sip."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2017-10-01,5.0,"Stopped in here for breakfast after a quick Yelp search of breakfast spots in the area and I was not disappointed! The breakfast sandwich was amazing. I should mostly say the biscuit it was served on was without a doubt the best biscuit I've ever had. The breakfast sandwich itself was thick cut ham, cheese, and a hard boiled egg. The egg was a little weird not what I was expecting but helped the mess factor of a breakfast sandwich on the go so it was actually appreciated. Ham very thick cut but it says so on the menu. Cheese ooey gooey and compliments that buttery biscuit perfectly. This sandwich honestly was the best start to my day in a while... for only $5! 
I also got a hot coffee which was a decent cup of coffee. The place is small - walk in, order, and be on your merry way out. There is a little courtyard area just behind the next building which has plenty of seating and a nice little fountain if you are looking for a spot to enjoy your breakfast outside. 
It looked like they have rotating specials of pastries if you're looking to try something new."

We walked in, after walking forever to get there, very excited to be there. I knew, from the reviews, that it was a small shop........but I figured Abby's incredible energy would be prevalent! NO! Service was horrible, he had no excitement, no suggestions! Said he'd never met Abby nor even knew WHY I was so excited to be there! I got a couple things and they were okay, nothing to write home about! I was Highly Disappointed!

Would NEVER recommend this place! Sorry, Abby!"

Well I got there without getting hit by a volt of lighting or seagull doodoo and found Donna Bell's bakery to be a small shop. The outside looks better than the inside and reminded me a mom and pop bakery in you old hood when you lived with grandma, remember? 

You can see in the inside that they actually bake the stuff there, cupcake biscuits, scones and more. Some of the scones and biscuit were real big, Too much for me in the morning but perfect for some New Yorker's, you know the ones that that take 3 seats on the subway, right!

I went for the Cinnamon Bum cause if it's sticky and gooey and it belongs in my mouth and not sitting behind a display case.  I also got the lemon raspberry scone, I liked the way the icing on top looked. 

This place has no where to sit so it's strictly take out. After I got to the office I took my goodies out of the bag and realizes that the wax tissue they used got  stuck to all the icing and lots of it came off.  The Cinnamon Bum tasted good and I could tell it was made with real ingredients and not artificial  fake flavorings. The scone was good, but it did not a strong lemon tastes. It had a small amount of  filling but not enough raspberry to make up for the missing icing.

Will I got back, well that depend on the Yelp God giving me a badge or two, else I think I go and check out other bakeries."
961,donna-bells-bake-shop-new-york,2019-04-02,5.0,"I love scones and most places have their take on them These were big, moist and sweet. I had raspberry with lemon glaze.

I've been here multiple times just because the location is convenient and the service is always quick and the people are always REALLY NICE. I've never been to a place where the employees were consistently so nice and happy to be there. I usually come during lunch time and an occasional breakfast. 

All their pastries taste wonderful. Their salads, sandwiches, to their hot foods are also very fresh and good. I signed up for their app where you can get a few rewards as well. I do wish they had a more extensive hot food / coffee list but that won't deter me from coming back."

Every single time I go in, the employees are SO NICE. They seem to genuinely enjoy working there and seeing customers. I love it!

The food is also pretty darn good for the price point and venue. Great sandwiches, salads and good soups. But they also mix it up with yummy max & cheeses and quinoa bowls. 

Thumbs up all around!"

Will come back and try other things."
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2018-06-03,4.0,"This little shoppe has pop-ups all over NYC. It's essentially a fancy, more expensive coffee shop with a few food items that are shelved or at the register. I will say the food seems to be healthier than your typical corner café based off of sandwiches made out of whole grains, avocados and veggies next to a homemade-looking fruit parfait. The croissants are three quarters the size of a typical NYC croissant at about a dollar more expensive and the coffee is more expensive as well(and you have to make it yourself). Nevertheless, the food is good and the locations themselves seem clean. They do not make hot meals and there are a few places to sit and eat. I'd say this is a fine place to grab a quick breakfast or lunch, as the food tastes good, but it won't help your wallet any."
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2016-11-02,4.0,"I've been working nearby and have found myself coming to this Pret on average once a day. It's on the smaller side, but the food is always well stocked and the line moves quickly. You can get in and out with your lunch in just a couple minutes, which is perfect for busy workdays when I can't spare much more than that. The people working here are friendly and helpful.

Food wise, I really enjoy their soups (Chicken noodle, Moroccan Lentil, and Tomato and Feta), and if I'm feeling a little indulgent, love the Spinach, Tomato Mac and Cheese. It's the perfect portion and has enough veggies for it to feel somewhat healthy. The ""pots"" of overnight oats, chia seed pudding, and greek yogurt make great, quick afternoon snacks."

I had the Roasted parsnip and pistachios power lunch, which is part of their spring menu: roasted parsnip, mint, pomegranate seeds, pistachios, lemon, Pret's grain mix (white and red quinoa, black and green lentils), parsley, lemon juice. It's delicious with a contrast of texture from the crunchy pistachio and pomegranate seeds, to the chewy parsnips. It's listed as a lunch but I could eat it as a breakfast."

The cucumber was giant; it was a large strip that was essentially the entire filling with the rest of the ingredients around it. I'm not a fan of cucumbers anyway so I picked it out and threw it away. After I got through half the wrap I threw out the shrimp too. They weren't very good. Shame on me for ordering seafood at a grab and go store like this. Ugh. 

I do like the fact that every night they give their food to charities helping the hungry. That saved it a star.

I might be back to try breakfast or soup at some point. I definitely will not be getting a wrap again."
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2014-03-10,4.0,"If you are like me, then first of all, I apologize.

Okay, I'm going to just get straight to the point because this is an easy one....

- If you are like me, and despise inordinately long lines, pret is a sanctuary for you, because there rarely is a line longer than a person or two ahead of you, at best.
- awesome sandwiches - highly recommend chicken + avocado varieties, egg salad, (the next two are a little heavy, but delicious) pulled pork wrap, meatball and mozz wrap. everything is wrapped up, incredibly fresh and ready to go.
- awesome soup - morroccan lentil is great. Well seasoned and filling.
- great drinks - my favorite is the tangerine honey. i love honey, its healthy. look it up.

clementines, bananas, apples, nuts located in the front before ordering, in case you want a convenient mid afternoon snack.

Conclusion: You are in and out. A rarity in the midtwon scramble for lunch spots (ie. usual suspects of chipotle, hale and hearty, cosi, chop't that often appear to have lines like a los angeles rush hour)."
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2012-02-04,4.0,"Nice convenient location right in Midtown East. If you're looking for a nice croissant to eat for breakfast, this is the spot. If you come in early enough, then they're nice and warm/crispy. It's a little small for the price you're paying, but it is damn good. Sure, Starbucks is close by, but their drip coffee is horrible. Pret has some organic coffee, with a good variety to choose from. Just pay your ~$2 and self-serve yourself to a nice cup of joe in the morning. 

Not much seating inside, aside from the bar stools facing 42nd street. If you work around here, ditch the Starbucks, and stick to Pret. Nice pastries, sandwiches, soup, and drinks. Even their pre-made energy/chocolate bars are tasty!"
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2017-12-05,1.0,The worst Pret ever! All their pastries are always stale! The staff isnt very friendly... Better to walk a few blocks over to the Pret on Lexington and 43 Street!
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2016-08-02,5.0,Love all their salads and club sandwiches and wraps. Everything I tried at Pret is so good. Their cappuccino is my favorite.
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2013-11-11,2.0,"I am regular, like a 5 day a week regular - bordering on boring! I have my daily lunch from this Pret. So when they introduced the 'hot wall' - I was impressed with efforts to improve efficiency till i opened my soup from the hot wall and it was HALF empty!!! I could have stormed back from my office and demanded better but really not my thing. I will take my business elsewhere thank you very much!

You are conveniently located but so are others! I would rather go somewhere else where they wont cheat me by placing half filled soup cups! You don't expect your customers to open every bowl and ask before paying to at least fill it up?? 

So disappointed that lost my appetite. ughh"
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2014-02-26,5.0,"I've always been a fan of Pret - lots of organic choices and healthy foods.  The chicken avocado sandwich is great, and I love the organic popcorn!  A bit disappointed they discontinued the brownie bites - they were just the perfect little square of chocolate when I had a sweet tooth without feeling horrible afterwards!
The NYU continuing education building is next door, and I used to come down frequently on breaks with my classmates to stock up on snacks and coffee before we went back to class!
Service was always good.  Nothing to rave about, but no issues."
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2011-12-03,3.0,"Early Saturday morning I came here with my visiting mother...grabbed some tea. I had the peppermint tea which was delish, my mom had some hot chocolate that I was told tasted excellent. She also dined on a very soft, fresh croissant. Yum. Not too busy when we got there, but shortly after, it got crowded. Service wasn't 5 star by any means, actually the guy who took our order mumbled the answer to any questions we had, and seemed rushed although there was no one else waiting and he most certainly was not doing anything before we walked up to the counter. Nice. Live the organic ""stuff"", I'd come back. Bathroom is pretty nice too...lol 

Oh, almost forgot, love the full glass windows, because you can ppl watch haha. Prices are decent too."
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2012-07-10,2.0,"The question I have for those of us who live and eat in New York is, have we lost our damn minds?  How did this chain get so popular?  Were we craving yet another mediocre grab and go place?

The name, ""Pret A Manger"" is a play on the French term for Ready to Wear, just meaning ""Ready to Eat"" instead.  How clever.  Though it is true.  You can go in, reach out for your tasteless, small, crummy sandwich, and eat it... on days you feel like punishing yourself for being alive.   It isn't even a chain from France, it is from London.  Don't even get excited about that, they don't even serve worldly foods.  And I'm not buying the ""natural ingredients"" that pull you in.  I call Hogwash!  Natural ingredients taste good.

Pro:  This place looked clean.

Now on to the cons.  The selection was small.  The menu is:  crappy sandwich with chicken and avocado, crappy sandwich with chicken and bacon, or crappy sandwich with ham and cheese.  Oh and don't forget our huge selection of crappy chicken salads.  And before you leave, try another crappy trendy juice of the month.  Same crap, different bottle.

I was in a bacon mood one fine afternoon (ok, that is every afternoon but I digress) and decided on the chicken and bacon, having forgotten a prior experience with this chain downtown, and Pret didn't waste any time underwhelming me once again.  The ""signature"" bread was boring and tasteless.  The small amount of grilled chicken would even make an anorexic cry.  I'm still not entirely sure the bacon was bacon...when I could find it.  The mesclun was gross.  The tomatoes were oddly plentiful, but not needed and awful.  (PS, you can't buy anything without tomatoes so I hope you like them.)  And finally the ""mayo"" and ""pret seasoning"" was nonexistent.  I also ask another question, ""Are Londoners known for their great seasoning?""  Think about it and get back to me.

Come on people.  This is NYC.  You can spit and hit someone serving better food than Pret A Manger.  And don't give me the ""it's fast"" excuse.  There is no excuse for this place to be on every street corner in midtown.  Rise up and send them packin'."
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2009-08-07,3.0,"Until the last weeks I found out that I have been saying the name of this place totally wrong.  
Forgive me because I know no french!
But otherwise this place is just a-ok for me.  For things like little snacks and sandwiches I much prefer Subway or places like Panera.  Quite expensive and quite crowded with people all for the lunch and dinner rushes.  
Their menu seems to cater to all the health conscious New Yorkers, which dont get me wrong, is not a bad thing but sometimes I just do not want to worry about all the calories in things and just have a good meal."
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2008-10-08,5.0,"Although this place is everywhere and is pretty expensive for a simple sandwich, I had the best experience at this location. 

Going on 36 hours without sleep, starving from running around NYC all day for a wedding, I needed to stop. Just stop and sit and eat. 

I settled on Pret a Manger because I was craving a simple but good sandwich. I saw exactly what I wanted as soon as I walked in: brie, tomato, and spinach baguette [just like Paris] and chicken noodle soup. I inhaled both, and felt much better. 

The brie was good and the soup was perfect to warm my stomach. Very happy."
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2015-09-18,5.0,"This location is quite an inviting spot, very clean and not too crowded (I went around 10:30 am). They have all sorts of fancy sandwiches at reasonable prices for the city. I had the French vanilla iced coffee which was delicious!! However, they do charge you extra for the French vanilla flavor, or else you'll get their regular brewed coffee. Other than that Pret is a nice little spot to pop in and get a quick fix :)"
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2010-07-01,4.0,"Their brownies are really good and cheap...the chocolate has a nice taste (rich/complex)....not your typical brownies. I really like them.  I could down a lot of the small ones.

I have never got anything I did not like. The food is extremely fresh and the ingredients are high quality.  Egg Salad sandwich is great for $4.99."
962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2009-05-19,4.0,"I generally take my food to go from here, so I can't comment on the ""sit down"" situation too much.  I will say that this place isn't too big, so it gets crowded FAST at lunch time.  Many times I've seen people standing around waiting for a seat.  The facilities use the standard Pret design with tile floors and walls and a primarily black/white design.  The facilities are clean and their stock of food is rotating constantly so there are no worries about freshness.

My favorite sandwich is their tuna.  It's low cal and tasty without relying on mayo.  I'm also a big fan of their turkey sandwich and all veggie sandwiches.  Their tomato soup is very tasty without being ultra-salty and my old boss swears by their mushroom and lentil soups.  For the sweet tooth, I recommend their tiny brownie bites which are absolutely delicious while being a good size to keep you from feeling like too much of  a pig afterward!

Pret isn't cheap, and I mainly save it as a treat now and then since I can get an equivalent size lunch for half the price in my company's cafeteria.  Still, it's a treat that's worth it now and then."

962,pret-a-manger-new-york-13,2012-01-25,2.0,"Gosh, it annoys the heck out of me that they always give you a big plastic bag for a little sandwich. Everytime I have to ask, ""Can I have a paper bag instead?"" 

Today, the cashier replied, ""We are limited.""

What the hell does that mean, ""you're limited?"" Do you mean you're short on paper bags? What are you going to save them for? For people who buy 1 brownie? I don't get it."

They're quick, inexpensive and so tasty! The guy at the counter is the best, is on top of everything, he remembers everyone's orders after just 2 visits- however he will always check to be sure u want to order the same thing before starting it.

963,homefront-deli-new-york-2,2017-10-16,4.0,"Nice little deli that has a nice assortment of pre-designed sandwiches, a bunch of wraps, and I believe a stir-fry station. 

I'm all for the carefully-crafted, locally-sourced, artisan sandwich outlets that have flourished as of late. Hell, I'm addicted. But sometimes a simple deli sandwich/wrap is in order. No frills, just hearty, tasty, filling goodness. Accordingly, I opted for the mix grill on a whole wheat wrap - fresh grilled chicken, sauteed onions, multi-colored bell peppers, mozzarella cheese, balsamic vinegar. No disappointments. Exactly what I wanted and needed."

It was good if you are in a rush, but wouldn't go out of my way to go here."
963,homefront-deli-new-york-2,2018-07-11,4.0,Good honest food cooked quickly. Get a breakfast platter and a ton of food for $4. My stop before meetings when in the area.
963,homefront-deli-new-york-2,2017-05-01,4.0,"This is a great convenient deli located across the street from my old office. They offer a variety of breakfast and lunch foods. Their bagels are fantastic, better than average deli bagels, and come with a healthy (IE not healthy) serving of butter if you order them that way for less than $2. They also serve omelette platter which come with potatoes and sliced toast for less than $6, which is a very reasonably price for midtown (favorite omelette platter is the Florentine which comes with feta cheese and spinach).

Their sandwiches are hearty and offer you really good value for your money. You'll frequently see construction workers coming for lunch and breakfast, which is a good sign that you've chosen a good bargain place in midtown.

The guys who work there are friendly and may begin to remember your orders or preferences (white toast vs whole wheat etc.) if you go there frequently enough."

It came in a standard wrap with chicken, peppers, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese and tzatziki white sauce.  A little heavy handed on the white sauce (and I love sauce) but very fresh and filling. I hate half and was full so I disagree with some of the other reviewers who claim the portion is too small.

This place was much more affordable than others in the area and they take cards ($3 min). It's not the prettiest place but it definitely got the job done.

For the price, convenience and small amount of time it takes, I'll definitely be back."
963,homefront-deli-new-york-2,2014-05-05,5.0,"I used to work on this block many moons ago, but I still think about it from time to time.  This little tiny place is always jam packed at lunch time.  They have a great assembly line setup though so you're usually in and out relatively quickly.

The pricing here was pretty aggressive given that it's at an odd location... one block away from grand central, but this spot doesn't get much foot traffic.  I absolutely loved their reuben sandwiches... one of nyc's best kept secrets in my opinion.  The hot pastrami was pretty good here but their corned beef shines.

When I got on a health kick, I got their grilled chicken wraps on a daily basis and occasionally would splurge and get the Sierra wrap.  I was never a big fan of their potato or macaroni salad....but I don't like that sorta stuff in general.

In the rare occasions that I got breakfast, I always walked away with a huge smile."

963,homefront-deli-new-york-2,2016-06-17,3.0,This has been a go-to for me since it's by my office and you could get a diner-quality breakfast (and diner portions) for bodega deli prices. This past time I was far less impressed as the portions have shrunk and the quality of the ingredients has definitely gone down. The most obvious sign of this was an omelette that came with frozen hashbrown patties soaked in grease instead of the usual fresh breakfast potatoes. Very disappointing and hopefully the owner sees this. I understand of they have to raise prices and that is definitely preferable to cutting corners. There's plenty of bodega delis in midtown where I can get that type of food.

However, fortunately for me I saw that they were still delivering during this lockdown and I happened to be craving a sweet brunch treat. They're delivering across a range of platforms, though this location seems to have the most extensive menu!

I ordered the Roseberry Waffle and an iced rose matcha latte with oat milk. The matcha latte was missing the roses, but nonetheless was still good and very plentiful for the price! The waffle was AMAZING. So crunchy. So flavorful. And the best part was the roseberry and creme came separate in little cups so I was able to decorate my waffle to my sweetness liking! It was soo delicious and hit the spot. So pretty as well. I know some people said one wasn't large enough, but because of how sweet it was, one waffle was plenty for me! Their menu looks like it has delicious salads as well, so I definitely will order again to try more items!"

This place is neat, clean and a place to see and be seen. My favorite breakfast is bacon scramble.  I add mushrooms to my order as it doesn't come with this dish . I also add extra bacon, mushrooms and onions. Delicious! Lots of times I eat in and take in the view of the many elegant women dining and working on their laptops while getting many looks right back at me!
When I'm in a hurry I order to go for me and my two assistants at work. They love the food too and are thankful when I do.
So happy to have them so close to home!
PS, Don't forget the cold brewed coffee for a refreshing start to the day."

Pros:
+ Healthy Breakfast Options
+ Great Service
+ Spacious
+ Clean restrooms
+ Quick service


Cons:
- Crowded for a Saturday Morning
- Pricey"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2020-05-13,5.0,"I go back and forth between the Nomad and Midtown locations of Blank Slate depending on how much time I have to escape the confines of my home office, and both are great. I noticed recently that the menus at the two cafes are slightly different - so Midtown has an edge because they serve my favorite matcha chia yogurt bowl here (as with all their food I've tried, they do not hold back on the toppings, which I very deeply appreciate). Although I'm most often here for the salads or just a cold brew, I also really like the breakfast bowl!"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-12-10,3.0,"Something that I'm very critical on when getting coffee is the options. Unfortunately, Blank Slate was lacking is that area. When I ordered a latte they told me they had no flavor options for lattes. I wasn't pleased with this, but the barista suggested I ordered a mocha instead for the flavor. Which is my opinion was flavorless. 

The presentation and artwork on the coffee was very impressive. I always feel special when the baristas do that little extra and make hearts so I feel special. 

Overall, generally acceptable coffee but on the more expensive side. Probably won't go back."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2020-02-21,5.0,"This place is amazing. I had the breakfast bowl - it was a ton of perfectly cooked vegetables + an egg and was super filling. I also had their house almond milk matcha latte which wasn't sweet at all but still not vegetal. 10/10 would recommend both. They also have healthy grab and go (overnight oats, ginger shots, and more) which are perfect to take with you. The service was super speedy and nice. Total for breakfast + juice shot + latte was $24."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2020-02-24,5.0,Nice popular place with a great menu. I love the avocado toast. It's self service and a nice place to work or study while grabbing a quick bite. It does get noisy during peak hours.
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-09-20,5.0,"I am obsessed with the Garbanzo Green salad. I found this place on seamless and they were offering a 25% off discount so I ordered the garbanzo green salad with chicken and it was extremely filling...I realized it actually didn't need chicken at all since the veggies on this salad really hit the spot and it's already pretty protein packed. Everything on the salad works perfectly and I love the dressing. 

The place is also very cute and chill the staff is pretty attentive and polite it's always pretty quick and easy to pick up my lunch when I order online and I will definitely be ordering at least a few times a month from here."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2020-02-03,4.0,"Perfect for a weekend brunch. Healthy and definitely instagram worthy pics! Super busy in here tho It was pretty loud. 
Got the chicken quinoa bowl was pretty good but the ends of the chicken was a little hard. The rose matcha latte was delish! You get seated and order up in front."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-11-18,4.0,"I had never heard of this restaurant until Meal Pal. I absolutely loved my chicken plate with salad. Avocado pesto, chicken. A little cheese. No carb meal that was actually delicious. 

I looked up the menu to order and Meal Pal 6 bucks but it was 14! Why I love Meal Pal. 

Adorable space with people on laptops and reading books. Great service. 

I'm a fan!"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2020-05-31,5.0,"I'm lucky enough to live 3 blocks from this cafe/restaurant, but I'd travel across the city for this delicious food. It's my favorite cafe in the city! You can't go wrong with ordering off the menu, but my absolute favorite is the bacon scramble. The staff are incredibly nice/helpful and the cafe itself is very clean and gets beautiful natural light which can be rare in NYC. It can get busy at times but you're never waiting long and the food is always worth it. Can't recommend Blank Slate enough!"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-12-11,5.0,"We came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty quiet. It just seems that whenever we go to a café in NYC, we always end up at the crowded ones with limited seating. Not this time! There were probably four other people there. We ordered rose matcha lattes, which to our surprise, were just lattes with rose petals. Not rose-flavored matchas. Eh, no big deal. It was a pretty good drink and the barista was very friendly."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-10-23,4.0,"How lucky we were that we did not give in to the terrible temptation to wait at Ess-A-Bagel but rather went to Blank State. Such a cute little shop, perfect for breakfast, despite a significant number of customers, everybody's turn came quickly. It was not difficult to find a spot to sit down. The coffee was delicious, as were the avocado toast, the fruit parfait with granola, and a hot chocolate.  Cool!!"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2020-02-13,4.0,Blank Slate is a pretty solid cafe. Good coffee and healthy food options. Perfect as a brunch spot.
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-11-04,5.0,"This new little neighborhood coffee shop is the perfect place to work out of on a weekday. It's also the perfect place for a quick brunch on Sundays. I've been here multiple times and the staff is very friendly, and I've been able to find a spot during the busiest of times (turnover is quick most of the time). 

Most recently, I went to Sunday brunch and got the Matcha Coconut Yogurt Bowl and the rose matcha latte. I like the food better than the lattes but this spot is quickly becoming a neighborhood favorite!"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2020-01-08,4.0,I love Blank Slate.  The coffee is excellent and the place has a relaxing vibe to sit and sip a cuppa Joe.  The food is outstanding I have had the quinoa bowl which was healthy and satisfying.  The breakfast bowl is my favorite.  It's just so tasty and good for you too.  Service is prompt a d friendly.  The menu is extensive and they sell booze too.  I highly recommend you check this place out.
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-10-15,5.0,"Accidentally stumbled across this little spot for brunch and I'm so glad I did! Even though it's super busy, I didn't have to wait for a table.
The interior is so cute and the staff are all extremely friendly! I ordered the bacon scramble and omg was it amazing. I also got an iced matcha latte. It was nothing special, wouldn't get it again. 
Definitely would return!"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2020-02-23,5.0,"Great brunch/lunch spot! Really good egg dishes, I love the mushroom scramble. The place is super cute too!"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-08-12,4.0,"Really nice service and environment. 
I ordered an avocado toast and it tasted quite different with ordinary ones as I guess they put some syrup on it. It's a bit sweet other than slightly salty and spicy. 
The waitress was very nice and helpful. I asked if it was ok to make the toast warmer and hotter, and she immediately turn to the kitchen and asked to toast the bread longer."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-08-10,5.0,"Probably one of the best places to have breakfast or even just a yummy sandwich in Ny! Prices are so great especially for NY pricing. 
When I stopped by I had a delicious ice coffee and of course their famous s'mores! 
Highly recommend checking this place out if you're ever in NY!"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-06-22,4.0,"Not much value for money. Pricing is comparable to places around the area however the portions were quite small. Ordered the bec+lt breakfast sandwich and rose berry waffle. Both were good but small. The $9 berry waffle was only one piece of waffle with some berries on top and some sauce. 

Otherwise atmosphere and service was good."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-06-15,5.0,"It's very minimalist for the inside decor! I love the service and the food there! 
For our double date, we ordered the avocado salad, steak sandwich (must try, so yummy), eggs and bacon and also one signature recommended by the server! They were so good! Especially for the sandwiches, the steak is so soft and tender, not dry at all. 
Also, the signature rose matcha latte was amazing! The favor is so strong, taste good and good for instagramming."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-07-13,3.0,"The breakfast Avo and Whites Egg Sandwich super disappointed. The gluten free bread was quality multigrain, but the bread-to-filling ratio really blew-- I think there was only one egg, and the avocado was a guacamole-like spread, but not enough to hold things together, so you can't pick up the sandwich without it falling apart. The dish needs cheese. Same thing when I tried the BEC+LT Egg Sandwich at their NoMad location last year.

Just looking around, I'd say the Bacon Scramble, or Mushroom Scramble, is the way to go, because the portions are more generous. 

Overall upsides: Tasty hot sauce, gluten free options, a good working environment with free, albeit unsecure, wifi (LinkNYC Free Wi-Fi also reaches), comfortable booths, charging ports, clean and lots of light because it's on the corner. In addition to coffee, they carry Iris Nova's Dirty Lemon elixirs (I like the +charcoal flavor), Pure Green, Kombucha and Natalie's juice. 

I plan to give it another go, so stay tuned for my updated review."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-06-30,5.0,This is an excellent addition to Midtown! The owner and staff are very accommodating & their service is spectacular! Everything from their beverages and food are simply delicious. My go to salad is the Avacado Caprese -mouth watering delish!! Their Avacado Toast is also sooo yummy!! The food is fresh & I cant wait to try the sandwiches next time. Love this spot! :)
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-12-31,5.0,"I am obsessed with this place. It's my favorite for catching up on a few hours of work, meeting a girlfriend or simply reading a book over a cappuccino. The service is always top notch, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is uplifting. I highly recommend the oat milk cappuccino and the bacon scramble (add avocado!)."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-11-24,4.0,I had a great experience at blank slate. They have a lot of options to choose from and it's very healthy. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. I ordered the quinoa bowl with double chicken and it was really good. I will say the chicken was a bit on the dry side but regardless I will be coming back. I will say it was a little on the loud side.
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-08-05,5.0,"Stopped by to grab a quick iced latte to go. Was pleasantly surprised by the warm and friendly staff. The gentleman making my coffee and the lady taking my order were soo nice and welcoming!! The overall vibe in there was pretty awesome. 
Also that iced latter was pretty damn good! I ordered it with almond milk and it was super tasty.
Will definitely be coming back for a proper stay."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-11-18,5.0,We stopped by on Saturday afternoon. This location is nicely decorated and spacious. There were lots of tables inside. We ordered 2 sandwiches and a latte. My daughter liked her chicken sandwich and her friend enjoyed her turkey sandwich. Both came with a side salad of greens. My latte was good. It was served in a nice mug and had beautiful latte art. They had a nice clean bathroom.
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-12-30,5.0,"I walked in for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised. My salad was delicious, probably one of the only times I have finished one. :P"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-10-29,3.0,"I really like the food here.  Its expensive, but I think completely worth it. It's healthy, high quality and balanced.

The only major issue I have had with this place is their long wait time and how they forget your order and make you ask for it again.  

I have stopped in to get food to go at Blank Slate quite a few times, but I keep receiving the same experience.  The service is very polite and friendly, but I end up waiting 20 minutes to get a sandwich.  It starts with everyone who has ordered after me receiving their food before me and ends with me having to ask for my order from the cashier who goes back in the kitchen and returns to reassure me that the food is coming.  I finally receive a quickly thrown together sandwich after waiting a few more minutes.  This is independent of whether the restaurant is empty or full or what I order.  
The wait was so long one time that the cashier gave me a completely stamped drink card(free drink).  I used the drink card to get a tea latte at a later date which was absolutely awful. 

I actually stopped coming here because of that repeat bad service, but I recently came again after a month and surprise surprise, I had to ask for my food.

Food is pretty tasty though."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-09-24,5.0,"Blank Slate was such a great experience, I went three times in the span of 5 days. Staff was really kind, attentive, and knowledgeable with the coffee drinks offered. They have great food options. I had both the bagels and cookies, each time I went! Though it was very busy, we were able to find seating. And the entire place is really clean. Lattes each time"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-11-12,5.0,"Love this breakfast and coffee spot!! One of my go to spots in Midtown. Excellent service, short weight for tables. Clean and bright atmosphere. Great to bring family, date, meetup with friends or go to spot to read and do work. My mom has the vegetarian grilled cheese, dad had the waffle and I had the parfait without the yogurt and added almond milk to keep it vegan. Highly recommend!"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-09-29,5.0,"Yummy did, quiet with plenty of seating dependinh on when you go, outlets, no judgement for working. I'll be back"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-07-27,3.0,"I understand this is brunch time, and I could enjoy my time before the noon time. However, they let me go at 10:30 in front of many other customers because they need my seat for others.i will never come again."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-11-23,4.0,"Quick breakfast on a Saturday morning. 
Was very busy but got seated fairly quickly. 
Avocado toast was tasty but the actual quantity of avocado could have been better. 
Coffee was very tasty and espresso-based. 
Price was reasonable for Midtown."
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-06-15,5.0,"Blank Slate has done it again! I live right near the NoMad location and love their brunch and lunch options, and now Midtown is so convenient to my office! The new space has the same airy and friendly vibe and I love their expanded dinner options to pick up after a long day at the office. 

I just tried the Grilled Chicken plate and it was very filling while still being healthy at the same time. I also love the attention to detail like free filtered cold water. I'm a Blank Slate regular and now I have another location to add to the list!"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2020-01-07,5.0,"I recently switched from a full time in-office job to a freelance remote role and I am SO glad Blank Slate is located in my area! I love to come here for coffee, breakfast/lunch, and an awesome work environment. I almost didn't want to write a review because I want to keep this place as a new hidden gem instead of sharing it with everyone else :)"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2019-08-23,5.0,"I stumbled upon this place while trying to find a place to get a quick lunch in the area, and it was a happy accident! The staff were all very friendly, the food was good and reasonably priced, and they had free WiFi! I had a yummy grilled cheese and a beautiful and tasty rose matcha latte. It was definitely busy there but also a nice place to sit and read for a while. I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area again!"
964,blank-slate-midtown-new-york,2020-02-17,5.0,"Blank slate is my weekend go-to! I've tried many different options on the menu and am always satisfied. Their salads are my favorite thing that they offer here, many great healthy options. The rose matcha latte is also great!  It's often pretty crowded but I've never had an issue getting a table"
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2020-03-05,5.0,"I am often working remotely on days I find myself in NYC, and I have definitely found my new favorite cafe to work from!

I came here after getting breakfast from one place and coffee from another in search of a good coffee shop to park myself for the day. Ground Central has plenty of seating, from high tables to long shared work benches to a set of couches in the back. Lots of outlets too. 

I had the Wild Berry donut which was absolutely TO DIE FOR - moist, extra sweet and chock full of blueberries inside. The hot apple cider was delicious as well, and paired well with the donut.

My only issue was that the cafe's wifi didn't work. However, the barista recommended I try the Link NYC WiFi from inside Ground Central, which worked like a charm. I've only been here once, so not sure how representative my wifi experience was, but I have no complaints since I was able to access the public wifi from the cafe. Overall, I'm so glad I found this place, and that they have locations all over the city -- I've definitely found my new favorite place to work from when in NYC!"
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2020-03-16,3.0,"I liked the coffee - a large Americano on a weekday in March after somewhat strong flavored Thai lunch.

A bit acidic for me, but I suppose it was their ground of the day.

It is quite renowned for its murals ... dark black walls ... dim lighting ... which personally am not much of a fan of. The seating right in front of the murals was ver cozy on a sofa ... but that was it (for me).

We carried our coffees out since it was a beautiful day after all."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2020-01-16,5.0,"I'm going to up my rating to five stars.  This place has become my go to coffee spot.  The staff is super friendly, the decor is different and very cool, and I just can't stop eating their treats.

I might want the coffee a tad stronger but that is individual taste and I wont hold it against them (but stronger and hotter would be a nice step up for this customer)."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-12-22,4.0,"Cute comfortable coffee shop. Usual options, plus a really nice assortment of pastry items. You can also get food too. Go early for the pastry, though, by the end of the day it will be slim pickings. 

The mocha with almond milk was really good, it tasted like hot chocholate rather than a coffee with chocolate in it. 

There's a lot of seating in the front area, with a really cool couch/chair room in the back with a totally different vibe."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-11-29,5.0,"It's all about the Oat Milk Latte!  Using Oatley Barista blend, Mr & I took the cue from the crowd & placed our order.....forego the regular milk & give Oatley a chance!

Latte with an extra shot.  Perfect coffee to milk ratio. Creamy & needed no sugar. Doesn't get better than that.

We ordered this every morning we were in NYC.  Paired with the spicy cheese biscuit for the Mr & the pumpkin muffin of the day for me & we're talking the perfect morning treats"
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2020-03-08,5.0,"Great cup of coffee near the theatre district. Prices were good, the coffee was tasty, and the pastry was delicious (caramel pear, thank you!). They have a cute little seating area that's great to relax for a bit."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-11-15,3.0,"We stopped by Ground Central in hopes of a quick breakfast and a cozy spot for us to study for a few hours. They had a lot of sweets (donuts, pastries, etc.) and open spots to study / eat. But, other than their menu selection and non-crowdedness, our experience was not that positive. The tea was normal. The scone was extremely dry and crumbly (way more than the average scone). And, above all, the place was so SO dark. We personally found it very gloomy and thus not a great space to study at. In the end, we left after eating. 

Your experience at this coffee shop might be better if you try other menu options and don't go with the intent to study, but overall our experience was ""meh""."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-12-15,5.0,"This is a great little neighborhood coffee shop. It was across the street from my hotel and I enjoyed starting each morning with a trip to Ground Central. There was something about the coffee smell when I walked through the doorway. I'm not sure why, but each time I walked in, I was flooded with memories of the coffee shops I used to hang-out in while I was in college. So many chains coffee shops don't have that delicious coffee smell. The coffee is delicious and the employees are very nice. I recommend giving them a try if your in the area."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-12-10,5.0,"During a recent New York trip, this Ground Central was one of the closest cafes near me. Luckily, the great coffee and the lovely staff kept me coming back frequently!

This Ground Central location is located right on 8th Ave, and it's moderately sized (having enough space for people working on their computers or meeting up with friends). The coffee was excellent, and from the Long Blacks that I tend to favor to the rare cortado that I tried during my trip, I did not have one bad drink from this cafe. 

While I did not spend a lot of time in the cafe, the lovely staff were welcoming and made every visit a joy!  I will definitely return when I'm back in town and in Hell's Kitchen!"
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-12-04,5.0,"Guess what??? This place is serving up some of the BEST coffee/espresso in NYC! Yep, I said it!! Wanna know the best part?? They are serving La Colombe coffee! I about died when we walked in and found that out. What's even cherry on top of my new find?? They have sizes! Why is that a thing?? So many coffee shops, like La Colombe for example don't sell lattes in sizes. Sorry, I like a gigantic drink that I can nurse through my morning.  They have small and large sizes for lattes. One size doesn't fit all, guys!

Wanna know what else is awesome?? They have Oatly oat milk! Yum!  I ordered my drinks like this, ""2 XL oat milk lattes, extra hot"". Do you know how many times they don't listen at coffee shops? Extra hot means, HOT.
Well Ground Central baristas do their job well. My drinks were absolutely perfectly prepared.

They are serving up some great food options too.  I for one like the tea sandwich (minus the salmon).  So thrilled to have a new option (new to me)."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-08-12,4.0,"This coffee shop is the place to be if you're in Mid town on new york city!
the darkest place I've ever been but that's their style and vibes of this place are absolutely insane in a good way, ofcourse! :)

Unfortunately, i repeated my order twice for ""eat-in""/""for here"" - and the guy still got it wrong and gave me in a take away cup. I usually enjoy my coffee more in regular cups than plastic/paper cups since i spend sometime in the shops I go to to enjoy the surroundings and/or doing my work and hence one star less.

the people work here seems to be cool and very interactive - the cappuccino was great, I expected the  prices to be cheaper than downtown area but $3.50 for a plain croissant seems like a lot - i still liked the freshness but would have a flavoured one for that price. overall the experience was great and hence 4 stars 

I would definitely go back whenever i am around this area again!"
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2020-03-07,5.0,"I randomly caught this place going between a show and the subway: great character, great coffee, great service, diverse crowd, feels more like a cozy corner where you could hang out for a while.   One of the better coffee shops in NYC for sure!"
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2020-02-25,3.0,"This location is cute but I thought the staff was a little stand offish. I asked if the chai was on the sweeter or spicier side and I was met with a kind of rude tone. The chai is DEFINITELY on the sweet side though - so if you like sweet drinks you'll like it! I prefer spicy so it was a little much for me, but not a bad drink by any means, just not my preference."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-11-17,2.0,Would not recommend ordering the mochas here. The hot mocha tasted burnt and the iced mocha straight up just tasted like milk. Also it's very dim inside so I'm not sure if you'd want to stay here for a couple hours to do work. There is limited seating so come early if you need a spot. The music can get a bit too loud and distracting as well.
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-06-29,4.0,"A tranquil coffee shop that is only a few short blocks from Central Park and steps from the busyness of NYC.  GC boasts the normal coffee menu but has a little more peaceful environment to enjoy both coffee and conversation.  

I ordered an black iced coffee and wasn't overwhelmed however, not much was expected with such a simple request.  The case was full of an array of pastries which all looked tempting...maybe next time."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-10-04,5.0,"This place is sooo cute! Its a great place to sit down and do work on your laptop. They have so many different options to choose from and even OAT milk! The coffee here is AMAZING and not acidic in my opinion. They also have some vegan snacks too. 

There's tables in the front and a couple in the back and a couch too if you want to lounge."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2020-02-13,4.0,I ordered a latte from this cosy shop. The line wasn't long as it was late afternoon. Service was nice and fast. My drink was nothing special but I'll likely come back considering how close it was to my office.
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-09-27,4.0,"Love the coffee here. Very smooth and more importantly, the temperature is just right.

Will definitely be back !"
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-07-11,5.0,"Very cute coffee shop in Midtown. I needed a place for an afternoon meeting that was conducive to a long conversation. Loved this location. The store has a nice ambiance - not too lit up and calm and perfect for a conversation. The front has high tables which are tiny but you don't need more than that when you're getting coffee. There are some couches/armchairs in the back. They were already taken when I got there but they looked comfy.

We opted for a nitro cold brew and for a latte. Both were delicious and quickly made. The menu options were long and it was hard to settle on one. 

Definitely would come back here when I'm in the area."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-01-22,5.0,"Very comfy, laid-back coffeehouse.  The back portion, with its chairs and sofas, is as cozy as a family room.  And, fair warning, once folks grab a chair or sofa seat, they pretty much never leave.  If you can snag a seat back there, you probably won't want to leave, either.

Located near hotels but the customers mostly seemed to be locals.

Friendly counter folks here and the coffee was good.  Good stuff."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-07-14,4.0,"Great atmosphere 5/5. I really do love the set up and vibe of this coffee shop. Very dark and cozy. If you're lucky, get a seat at the back - there's a nice big couch. 

You also would think they would blast the AC when it's super hot out but nope. It felt roughly around room temperature inside and the bathroom was even more hot and humid 3/5. 

The cold brew wasn't as strong 3/5. I really wasn't over the moon about their black coffee. 

If you're in the area, a good pit stop to sit and relax over drinks and pastries."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-12-30,5.0,This café is super cozy place to set an all day and is one of my favorites in New York. They make a coffee and have a awesome mother catches and plugs and everything in the back. If I had to pick a café to sit in working all day or to hang out with a friend then I'd pick this one!
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-07-18,5.0,"I always come here when friends visit the city. They always have great air conditioning and seats, which is a hot commodity in this city. Their drinks are appropriately priced and fairly tasty. They have gone the extra mile by creating an interesting, almost smoking lounge/ library vibe with their decor. I honestly can't say enough good things about this spot."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2020-02-15,5.0,- Awesome service & coffee is on point ! The staff seem friendly & super knowledgeable when it comes to their product. Best coffee shop in NYC!
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-05-01,5.0,"One surefire way to get me into your place of business is a play on words.  Puns and creative names always grab my attention and one day while walking from the West Side to the East Side of midtown Manhattan I came across Ground Central.  I could almost hear someone next to me nudging me with their elbow going ""Ground Central...eh?  Eh?  Get it?  Because we're near Grand Central!"" and me rolling my eyes while laughing in spite of myself.  With a name like that, I had to check this place out.

The interior of Ground Central is not what I expected.  I am so used to coffee places nowadays having bright wood and tons of sunlight pouring in.  Instead, Ground Central looks more like a very comfortable gastropub.  Dark wood and dark colors make up most of the interior and somehow it is very welcoming.  The front area is where you order and pick up your food.  The front has some limited space to hang out, but the back is where there is a reading room-like seating area to really sit back and relax.  In between are the rest rooms.

My go to drink here has been the Dirty Chai Latte.  I've had it cold and hot, and either way they manage to make it tasty.  There is a bit of bite (which I want in my Chai) but you can taste the espresso hit.  They do use a premade Chai mix but I don't mind.  Their service is always fast and friendly.  Whenever I am near this place I make it a point to visit.  You should too!"
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2020-01-02,3.0,"Very hard to call it...good product, efficient service, but it feels like if they don't like you, it's okay to be unfriendly.  The American customer service model is to be friendly to all, and maybe that's changing.  

For all their faults, Starbucks makes you feel happy you ordered."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-06-01,3.0,"Review only pertains to the matcha latte.

Five stars for the space.
Four stars for service.

One star for the matcha latte, if it can be called that. It's mainly milk with the slightest hint of weak tea and barely discernible color. For something approaching $6, I guess they created it as an afterthought for non-coffee drinkers with a brand-appropriate price tag.

They use a matcha mix, hence the nonexistent flavor. The barista was nice to try to add half a teaspoon extra for me after  I tasted it, though it didn't make a difference."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-01-05,5.0,"Ground Central is a clever name and all, but I'm going to start referring to this coffee shop as Double Threat. Why? Because they ALSO SERVE BEER. I wish more coffee shops in NYC would follow their lead, I've seen this in lots of other cities, and especially overseas. We're really behind the curve here, but good thing Ground Central is around to set the bar.

I got a dirty chai latte and loved it -- slightly sweet, and I could still taste the espresso, which doesn't happen at other places that dump sugar and caffeine into a cup and hope for the best. It was a really well made drink.

The space is great, it screams ""cafe"" as soon as you walk in, with the soft lighting and dark walls. It's a great spot for working and for quiet conversation with a friend or two. There's free WiFi and quality service behind the counter. I'll definitely be coming back!"
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-07-02,5.0,Love the ambiance although the music was a little loud for reading.  Big fan of coffee/tea/beer/wine bars.  Didn't try the food but my mocha was cocoa-y and perfect.
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-04-24,5.0,"Came in this morning for my now usual, small chai tea latte with almond milk & shot of espresso. I love the staff here, I came in Saturday afternoon and this morning and it doesn't matter whose behind the counter; everyone is so nice and respectful. I love watching employees engage with loyal customers, this women in front of my in line recently lost her husband and the cashier was so sincere and truly made her morning. That's what I love, everyone here has a chill vibe that gives the morning rush to work such a ease. These girls this morning move fast! I love this coffee shop, it's a great place to stop in for work and there's enough seats for studying. I'm truly a fan, don't pass up on this place y'all."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2018-11-12,5.0,"Coffee is an understatement for NY.  A true staple, where every other block has a coffee shop, pretty much...  We were in Times Square and in needed of warmth and caffeine but most of the coffee shops had no bathrooms! So I would highly advise you to look into this before heading your way. 

Little outside of Times Square, we were able to find this gem.  Pretty hipster vibe with cute art drawings, dimmed lighting, and comfortable seating.  Best of all, clean bathroom!  To access, you have to get the pin code from the cashier during your purchase.

Of course, their coffees were delicious as well.  You can customize as you like and be met with friendly service."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2020-02-15,5.0,"This place became my favorite coffee shop in my neighborhood. I don't get to come here too often but it's like a treat for me each time a crave my macadamia latte :) Inside is very cool, I love the art on the walls and library looking back room. Wish I could spend more time there. The staff is very friendly, especially Barista Oli, who always has genuine smile on her face and makes my coffee just perfect! Jasmine at the register was also very nice."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-11-27,5.0,The aesthetics are on point! The girl was so nice helping us and serving us yummy coffee. There's no bathroom but she directed me to the correct place
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-04-24,4.0,"Stopped in after work this morning. Was greeted at the counter. Staff was friendly. Inside it was dimly lit and there was an area in the back to lounge. They sell little snack items and pastries. I also seen a menu for sandwiches and beer. Awesome! I loved that they have milk alternatives such as oat milk, almond milk, hemp milk and my favorite, macadamia nut milk. I ordered a small iced latte with macadamia nut milk. It was average priced for the area at $5.32. Would be nice if it cost a little less for a small. The coffee itself was nutty and smooth. Perfect blend of macadamia nut milk. I stopped in because I love searching for the perfect latte and I love the name."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2018-09-05,5.0,"Food / Coffee: 4/5. 
Super good cold brew! Clean and smooth. 

Atmosphere / Service: 5/5. This is the highlight of this place! Great vibes. Has a super comfy back room with ample study space, large tables and nice staff. The best part is the sort of old retro vibe you get. I felt like I was back in the 30's drinking black coffee and catching up on the latest news. 

Price to experience ratio: 5/5. 
The atmosphere here is so dope. Considering the coffee is pretty flavorful and smooth, it makes for a solid deal. I paid $4 for a small cold brew, which is on par with other spots in the city. BUT other spots don't have this vibe. 
Check this place out, definitely! They've also got a Grand Central location, and I've heard that one is great, too."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-12-28,4.0,"They have pretty good vibe and atmosphere. I ordered an ice matcha latte, which to be honest is just okay, but still not bad."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2020-02-05,1.0,"I waited 8 min for 2 frittata sandwiches to be heated up and after not getting them, asked to have them too go as I was now late. The cashier asked the barista for them and barista daisy, what??  She had done nothing with the order and had no other work bbt are there at her station. It is not bust.  The oat milk latte was weak and tasted like a Luke warm cut of oat milk. No espresso taste at all. I tipped 20% for $28+ of awful service and products. They handed me 2 ice cold frittata sandwiches and said they e only been in the fridge for just over an hour as if that made this debacle ok. The bread was cold and rock hard with a small piece of egg. For $6.50 each! Yuck. The barista needs to take pride in her work. At least deliver coffeE at a proper temp."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-11-23,1.0,"Wow! I've never been yelled at by a barista
. They They made a mistake with my drink order. When I alerted to them of that, she said ""I don't care.""  She blamed the cashier register, and said it's not her fault, and that I have to go to the back of the line, and wait another five minutes. She then proceeded to yell at my friend very loudly over the heads of all the other customers to repeat that she didn't care. There was no manager on site to help.  Ridiculous. Never been treated this way as a customer.

Will not go back."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-01-20,3.0,"I was snagged in by the pun! I do love a good pun, especially when reminiscent of Central Perk from Friends. Alas, I wasn't as smitten with the coffee. 

It was bustling when we popped in on a Saturday morning. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. I ordered a black coffee and a berry scone. The coffee was just so-so; the scone decent enough. My friend says their espresso is very strong, so usually gets only one shot in a small latte. With so many other spots for coffee nearby, I'll give the others a go before popping back in here, but when I do I'll give the lattes a go."
965,ground-central-new-york-4,2019-06-24,5.0,"Good coffee.
Nice staff.
Fast WiFi.
Chill space with upbeat soundtrack.
A nice selection of sandwiches for meat eaters and veggies folks alike and all the expected coffee shops pastries too. Fast and efficient on prep times.

I came here to work and it was a great location in which to get caffeinated and stay focused. On a sunny spring day the full plate glass windows in the front let in the cheeriness is the day (and reminded me how nice it is to be out of the sun and in a temperature regulated environment!) while the subdued lighting toward the back made it easy to work on my computer. 

Great spot!"
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2020-04-22,5.0,"One of my favorite coffee chains in NYC. I love their coffee so much that I always order beans from them. Even now, in difficult times, I was able to order coffee delivery. I can't wait to make my favorite coffee at home again."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-12-03,5.0,"their scones and chai lattes are so good 
i order a chai latte at every coffee place i go to and this is my favorite place to get it tbh. 

its a bit small with only 4 seats- so it's not a place i would recommend if youre trying to study and get work done but if you need a quick to-go drink in the area i def recommend this spot"
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2020-03-15,4.0,"Cute little coffee shop near the 59th Lexington subway station.  

Macchiato was A+ and the mini scones were great too!  

Great spot to catch up with friends- homey and whimsical."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-12-24,4.0,"Came by the other morning for coffee and it was a decent experience. The cashier was courteous and short, in a typical New Yorker fashion.

Ordered a Mocha and it was quite tasty. Chocolate wasn't too sweet, espresso was smooth, and mocha was the perfect temperature!

Their small mocha was definitely a small!

They do take contactless payments via Square!"
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2020-03-12,5.0,"Small little coffee stop with actually great coffee on drip! Nice light and bright medium roast, ready fast. The servers were really nice and made small talk. Plus there's a student discount! Great place"
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-09-14,5.0,"I made it my mission to find decent coffee places around the city. Starbucks is great, but finding gems like this that brew their own blend of coffee is incomparable.

For starters, this is the CUTEST little shop! Baristas were extremely friendly and were excited to hear it was my first visit. I decided to go with the cold brew and man was it delicious! I could taste the freshness (for all my coffee drinkers you know what I means).  I was a little bummed they didn't have almond milk because I generally don't drink cream, however I was pleasantly surprised to find out they had Oatly milk! I have only found two coffee shops that serve this milk so I was a happy camper when the barista told me they had it! Definitely give this place a shot because it's worth it."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-10-27,4.0,"Birch is one of those spaces that is hard to walk by. Somehow I shuffled past it to work for nearly a year, but the wooden interior and small, inviting space always made me want to wander in. I finally let in and ordered an oat latte. 

I wasn't prepared for the tiny "" small "" cup that would be presented with the nearly $5 price tag. My colleagues got a good laugh at my baby latte and I'd already vowed that I wouldn't return. Or rather, shouldn't at that price. 

But of course, something about this tiny, cozy space with long lines at peak hours made me glance in again and I noticed a reasonable $2.75 drip. And in the same 8oz cup, just the size I need for coffee. Bonus, the adorable personalized cups (when they have time to actually fill them in)

Oh, and the coffee is smooth and good if any of that matters at all."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-30,5.0,"Giving my favorite Birch 5 stars! It's a small little coffee shop that I discovered many years ago and have been very pleased with everything :) 

Here's what I normally get here:
* Oat-milk Latte (hot & iced are equally great!)
* Chocolate croissant 
* Banana-bread (it's tiny, but REALLY tasty!)
* Blueberry muffin
* Chocolate muffin

Bonus point: they have a stamp card so use it because once you're done, you can pick any drinks you want and you can ask for a large cup as well :) 

This place is super small and the seating area is limited, but if you come early in the AM or late afternoon, you should be able to grab a seat. Too bad this place doesn't have WiFi or bathroom though."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-12,3.0,"Service was really fast. I got the small hot chocolate and it pretty pricy for how small it was ($5). It was not very chocolatey and the milk was luke warm. I've had better, it was not that good.
I wanted a pastry but the selection was very slim and the food looked a little old.
My boyfriend got large iced coffee and he said it was pretty good. Had a nice flavor.
Workers rushed us and were not very friendly. I would not come back here. It was so small inside too. Very cute aesthetic  and decorations though!!."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2020-02-09,5.0,Birch is easily my favorite coffee place in the city. I have been to almost every location in Manhattan and it never disappoints. I even buy the bagged espresso coffee they sell in stores and ship it to my parents in Florida. All I need is a large latte with a dash of cinnamon to get me through the day. Only downfall of the location is that its quite small.
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-09-12,3.0,"Atmosphere: I was in and out but the vibe was cute and bustling but not overwhelming. The space is very small and cozy. 

Service: no complaints:)

Coffee: I got a black coffee, iced. My partner got one hot. Was 6+ bucks or so. Solid cup of coffee. Not in love, but I'll enjoy it. Boyfriend liked his.

ONE MAJOR COMPLAINT that actually drove me to write this review:
I'm all for these no-straw-sip-cups for cold beverages but mine is LEAKING like a muhfckr. Since it's a sip cup, I have to tilt it to drink so every time it leaks like a damn mini Niagara. Granted, it may be a defect cup, but still ruined my experience. So frustrating and coffee everywhere."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-05-19,2.0,"Incredibly rude barista today. I'm not sure what's up with NYC baristas. There are very few coffee shops with friendly baristas and quality coffee.

Latte: 6/10
Service: 1/10

We planned on Birch being our daily spot on the way to work. Too bad. 

Good luck to ya!"
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-09-29,1.0,You gotta be kidding me.  Last time I tasted something as bad as the espresso here was when I siphoned gas out of my car.  Too vile to swallow. Filthy coffee makers.
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-03-16,2.0,"Meh. I got a latte with soy milk, the size is relatively smaller compared to other local coffee spots like Ninth Street Espresso. Reason why this is a 2 stars review is because this latte taste so water down. I felt like I was drinking regular coffee. Also, soy latte that cost $5.25 and taste like regular coffee? No thanks. 

Also, the barista was on his break for 10 mins so we had to wait. The guy at the register was very nice and said he can only do tea, cold brew or drip coffee."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2020-02-16,3.0,"Birch is a fave coffee spot of mine in the city, all locations, but unfortunately today they missed the extra shot I def paid for at the register.  I get it, I'm not the only customer, but $6 for coffee that's half the strength I paid for is a total bummer."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-16,3.0,"Stopped in for a drink on a Friday morning. I was surprised by the super small location. The only seating options are a counter with 3 stools. There is a limited menu with a few pastry items, Greek yogurt, etc... if you're hungry. I ordered the small chocolate chip scone, which was delicious. To wash it down I had a glass of their free water that is set out with small cups, and an iced mocha with oat milk. Several non-dairy alternatives are available, but I have been in an oak milk phase that borders obsessed. There was a steady stream of people coming in and out, and the decor is cool and industrial. The staff could have been a little more friendly/professional... but I guess that's what you get in NYC."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-07-13,4.0,"Super tasty coffee! I ordered just a regular latte and the coffee cups are cute! It is such a small place so you couldn't really sit down, but I took my coffee to go."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2018-11-12,5.0,"This place is pretty amazing. The coffee is good and the staff is friendly. A small space but we were able to get a spot by the window and watch passerbys as we sipped our coffee. There's also a pretty cool book exchange. If you're into that kind of thing. 

I will definitely return soon."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2018-08-31,5.0,Good coffee cute little location. The people who work here are super chill especially in the morning! Not really anywhere to sit if u come in the afternoon. There's about 4 bar stools and a bench outside.
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-04-16,5.0,"Great hole-in-the-wall coffee shop in Upper East Side NYC. Very small space with a tiny, 3 person standing/seating area. All the standard beverages are on the menu. For some reason they did not have almond milk, so we ordered 2 machiattoes made with oat milk. They were made promptly and were really good. We drank them quickly in the bar area and moved along with our day (not a place you can really linger). Service was friendly and prices were reasonable."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-12-07,2.0,"Nothing to write home about. No ""Dear Mom, I had the most transformative coffee today."" I got a red eye with oat milk, which wasn't bad, but the barista added far too much milk. I might as well have just ordered oat milk, which I've seldom had, so that would've been okay, but I ordered coffee. My wife got a small drip which was a small drip of a lot of fuckin' milk. Cool café, but the people need to be given dominion over their cream/milk. Great coffee spot for someone who's used to Dunkin', but if you're accustomed to rootin', tootin' coffee, pass on Birch."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-11-13,5.0,"This place is very cute. I travel a lot so I'm always looking forward to finding good new places! I got the seasonal spiced latte with oat milk and it was really good. It's usually a hit or miss for me when I try a new place's latte and this one was really good. It's cute and cozy inside but not really enough space to sit and stay, plan on getting it to go."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2018-12-29,2.0,Very hard to find actually. Anyways service was whatever. Didn't get a hello or anything from the barista and it seemed like I was a bother to him? lol. The mocha latte was nothing special. It tasted somewhat artificial. Super small cafe so be aware. It's more of a grab and go. Either way I wasn't happy with my purchase and don't think I'll be back here.
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2018-04-29,5.0,"You know you're going to a hole-in-the-wall establishment when you see a '1/2' in the address, and they're often the best places to check out. Birch Coffee is no exception, packing a great caffeinated punch in its small space. They have their own house roasts, with the medium being particularly strong and flavorful. Cool cozy space, nice baristas behind the counter, a great UES way to start your day!"
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2018-04-16,4.0,The Quick: tiny location but the coffee is always excellent! It's right off the main avenue so a bit out of the craziness as well. A nice spot when you need to get away from the 9-5 hustle and get a great cup of coffee. Enjoy!
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2017-09-09,5.0,"I love Birch Coffee! Even though there is a Starbucks on the same block as my apartment I always make it a point to walk the extra few blocks to go to Birch coffee. This location is small and quaint and in the summer time they will leave the front open so you can enjoy your coffee with some fresh air! Their cold brew and lattes are absolutely delicious- you can't go wrongs stopping in here for some coffee!

They recently added a rewards program (punch card) which is an added bonus. I'm hoping they come out with a phone app in the near future!"
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-18,4.0,"Being stuck on jury duty means I've has ample time to visit every coffee shop in the neighborhood, and I think Birch takes the gold. The shop is a little hidden (the entrance is actually around the building from where the map shows it pinned), but worth looking for. Small but comfortable and clean, there is plenty of room for you to park somewhere and get some work done or relax and enjoy your coffee... which it turns out is OUTSTANDING at Birch."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-09-17,4.0,Very good coffee and espresso drinks. Pastries are not the best and sometimes the service is a bit apathetic but I still visit all the time anyway.
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2018-03-11,4.0,"This is a great coffee spot. Its off the beaten path, so you only know its here if your a local or a Yelper! I must have come at just the right time, since there was just one person in front of me. By the time I ordered my coffee and paid, there was a line out the door! It is a very small spot and no where to move. 
It is nicely decorated with a bookshelf and a window bar, but not much room for anything else. It really doesn't matter.... The coffee is Amazing! If you your looking for great  coffee and they great service, you need to find this place. If your someone who doesn't care about what the coffee tastes like, this place will change your mind. I love finding these diamonds! Thanks fellow Yelpers!"
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2017-12-31,4.0,"Its hidden behind Joe and The Juice, its a very small cafe with no bathroom (sorry to disappoint!). Came here on a snowy, 15 degrees evening, luckily we got there right around 6 and they were closing a couple hours early due to the holiday weekend. 

Ordered a hot coco and a mocha latte, both were solid and soothing but the coco was better than the mocha latte. It seems that they have two sizes, one is 8 oz and the other 12 FYI o_O."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-24,5.0,Love Birch. One of my preferred coffee shops. Mochas are especially good. This is a small but cute location. Shop opens up to the street when the weather is nice (which allows for seating on both sides of the small bench area which is the only available seating). Has a small lending library too.
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-08,5.0,Solid spot for an afternoon pick me up. Never stayed in but looks like a nice spot to kill some time (although a bit tight :)
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-05-03,1.0,"Normally, I give them 5 stars; today they were out of oatmeal/ cranberry cookies & all cookies, the place was very dirty & the espresso didn't taste the way it usually does. VERY disappointing!!"
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2018-08-27,5.0,"Outstanding iced oat milk latte. Oat milk is the only non-dairy milk that mirrors the flavor and thickness of actual cream (but better), and can stand up to the strong, flavorful, fresh espresso (or coffee, anything). They use Oatly here. Regardless of your milk preferences, consider giving this a try."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2017-11-20,2.0,"Ordered two espressos here over the weekend and they were both below average.  Aroma was fine, but the acidity was way off.  Coffee just tasted way too tart to be enjoyable.  The body was also way too thin, and I was really missing that full body smoothness that I was expecting.

Service was friendly and efficient, and that was the highlight of the whole visit.  Maybe a spot to grab a quick cup of joe, but probably not coming here for espresso again."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2018-11-20,5.0,The coffee here is amazing. They don't have dairy so you won't get skim or whole milk here and they don't have almond milk but they do have hemp milk and soy I believe. It's delicious with hemp milk and my favorite is just a classic latte. Melts in your mouth!
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-04-22,1.0,Good coffee and the place is so tiny and expensive and they give you small as a medium . The workers have attitude as if you say no whip they get mad and say we don't that .
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-05-26,2.0,"A friend wanted to meet here because it's close to her apartment. It is very small - only room to seat three people. I ordered an iced green tea, which was more expensive than the same size drink at Starbucks. I took a sip and it tasted a little bland, but I didn't really look at the drink. We left the shop since there were no open seats. We were halfway down the block when I realized there was a bug in my tea! I had put a lid on it, so the bug didn't fly in while I was walking down the block. My friend said we should go back so I could get another one, but I just threw it out. Two starts instead of one because the barista was very nice."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2019-06-08,4.0,"Very small place, so don't expect to come here and sit down and enjoy for coffee for a while. It's all standing room only but it's perfect if you want great coffee on the go. Came here twice and both times the line was out the door but the 3 baristas working the counter moved quickly. Ordered a pour over and a cappuccino. Both excellent. Pastries left a little to be desired. The chocolate croissant was a little heavy."
966,birch-coffee-new-york-8,2017-09-19,5.0,"I was in need of a caffeine fix on the UES and one of the staff from Make Up For Ever recommended Birch Coffee. And I thank her. Very very much.

This location is small and cute - floor tiles, wooden stools and elaborate coffee decor. Definitely a pop in place. They have approximately 8 seats on one longer table, four inside and four on the street side. There is also a bench outside. 

I ordered an oat milk latte, first time doing so. Wow, I may never go back. It was so smooth and tasty. Plus it was beautiful, the barista definitely nailed the latte art (which is generally a lot harder on non dairy milk). I nabbed a seat at the table and spent some blissful minutes people watching in the late Sunday afternoon sunshine and enjoying their kickass playlist. 

The staff were very friendly - and they got the coffee skills. They offer oat, soy (and perhaps coconut??) but not almond. I'm assuming that is deliberate ;-) Fair price for the area. There's no restroom. That about sums it up.

I'll definitely be back to get another oat latte fix and to check out their other locations."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2020-03-20,5.0,"SERIOUSLY one of my top 5 favorite places to meet up with a friend/do work in the city. They have both real food AND sweet bites, and the basic drinks, nothing fancy. The space is HUGE and spacious, and plenty of seating and outlets. The granite marble is gorgeous. The best part of Ole and Steen has to be the phenomenal service. Each of them were so friendly and helpful, and I've never felt more listened to/tended to in a cafe in NYC, let alone Midtown where no one cares to give you their 2 seconds. 

I got the chicken pesto sandwich which was the perfect light dinner bite, and also a pastry to share. Prices are steep for quantity but I'm willing to pay for just the amazing vibe here."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2020-02-28,1.0,"Wow what a disappointment to say it mildly I was at one of the bakery's a couple of months ago and was so excited to finally have a danish bakery in the US that actually had authentic Danish bakery goods  I just walked in today and what a let down!!! All the original pastries are discontinued and replaced with I don't even know what!? Low selection and no longer really a danish bakery besides the rye bread.

En kæmpe skuffelse igen træstammer,hindbær snitter,winerbrød eller smørebrød og udvalget der var tilbage var ingen gang rigtig dansk desværre jeg var der kl 2.30 og så lidt tilbage!! Altså virkeligt dårligt!!"
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-12-06,4.0,"Ole & Steen is my go-to coffee shop when I'm in Midtown. The overall ambiance is more cozy and quaint compared with Starbucks or Gregory's, and it's a great place to catch up with friends or coworkers. But the strongest aspect for Ole & Steen is their PASTRIES. They have a plethora of baked goods that are so original, pretty, and above all, delicious. 

Carrot bun
Savory baked bread with bits of carrot strips inside, while the bread itself is reminiscent of challah bread. The bun has this subtle, buttery after-taste. 

Strawberry tart
The prettiest out of all our orders. The tart is encased in a chocolate shell, while the top has large strawberry halves held together by a scoop of cream. Personally, the tart itself was a bit lacking, as it was too sweet and the crust too crumbly. 

Pumpkin cake
Typical coffee shop baked good. It wasn't extraordinary, but it satisfied our craving for something pumpkin-y. The loaf was about the size of a small hand, with a thick wave of cream cheese frosting on top and sprinkled with pumpkin seeds. 

Seeded rye bread
Ole & Steen sells bread loaves! They'll even offer to slice them up for you. My friend made fun of me for getting the ""ugliest bread available,"" but the seeded rye was unexpectedly yummy. The loaf is pretty small, but plenty of seeds and oats."

Happy to see this place in NYC after encountering them in Copenhagen"
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-10-17,5.0,"This place has some of my favorite sandwiches right now. For the morning, get the breakfast sandwich. It's a ham, egg, and cheese sandwich where the yolk oozes out from the middle with every bite.

For lunch I have tried the chicken & bacon sandwich and the turkey salad. Both are flat out amazing.

Chicken & bacon comes with grilled chicken, a few strips of BACON, sweet potato, lettuce, pesto and I think mayo over focaccia bread.

I don't remember what was in the turkey salad but there was something special about it compared to your corner deli.

Highly recommend any of the sandwiches! Cheers!"
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2020-01-29,4.0,"Located just across the street from office, I'm sure I'll visit Ole & Steen often. It has so many comfy seats and I can imagine coming here after work to relax. The first time I visited, I had extra time before going into work and decided to chill out with a treat.  The baked goods are good but a bit too sweet for my preference."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-07-31,5.0,"Wow! What a great surprise when I happened to find the place. Everything was so fresh and inviting. I loved the way the pastries were displayed. Reminds me of being in a bakery in Europe. 

The coffee was great and enjoyed the yogurt. Trying to stay off the carbs for now so I didn't enjoy the pastries. On my next visit to the city I will for sure order more!!

If you are looking for a good breakfast stop here!!"
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-06-23,5.0,"Great coffee/casual brunch spot in midtown!! Came here with a friend on a Sunday afternoon and although the cafe was crowded, there was plenty of seating, and we were able to grab a table immediately upon entering. Love the interior of this place - it feels like you're somewhere fancier than just a normal coffee shop! 

I had an iced tea and a Skyr yogurt parfait - no complaints about either. There is an extensive pastry/bread and savory toast selection - will definitely have to come back to try more of the food options!"
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-04-23,4.0,"I cross the street at Lexington Avenue and looked over my shoulder and notice that Ole & Steen had open across the street.

I just hate it when you see a new place under construction and are waiting for them to open then overnight they take down the window shielding and open up with a full staff and complement of foods with zero announcement or notice. I did my U-Turn and walked in. 

After looking around and taking some photos I got on line and ask for a large coffee and a Spandauer, the counter person recommended the Raspberry filling so I went with that for take out, but there is pliantly of seating if you which it serve and have it there. 

You pay right there at the counter that is lined with credit card readers and get you receipt. I guess it will take longer if you have cash. You are then asked to go to the other end to get your order. I got my pastries quick but was waiting like 7 to 10 minutes for my coffee, and then being told it was sitting there on the side all this time.  Dummy me took the receipt number as my number and not the pickup number on the bottom of the receipt. 

Well I got to my office and the bag for the Spandauer is a bit small so some of my icing got stuck to the top of the bag. But it did taste real good an it was nice an airy with the raspberry filling sticking to the roof of my mouth, Yeah but that didn't stop me from eating it all.

The coffee was OK but at $4.00 for a regular I was on real expensive side for me even if the block here has been upgraded with the new Godiva Cafe, Madison Kaiser and the Paris Baguette upscale cafe all on two blocks of Lexington  Avenue Not to mention Starbucks, Ground Central coffee and the dollar guys on every corner.  I am sure to go back and try the other pastries but I'm skipping the coffee."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-11-26,4.0,"Came here during the Ritual app promotion! I only ordered the chocolate muffin and it was ready almost instantly. I ended up waiting a bit on the side because there weren't directions on where to pick up my order, but the people behind the counter were super sweet and apologized and redirected me to the left side of the room. It's very spacious and filled with natural light albeit a bit loud. Seems like a sociable environment where it would be a good setting to catch up with a friend.

As for the muffin, I personally could have done without the nuts at the top. It was quite dainty and wasn't what I totally expected, but I got back to work and microwaved it and it still tasted great! Wasn't overwhelmingly sugary. Definitely will check out the other location in the city if I ever pass by."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-11-21,2.0,"They discontinued the old fashioned social aka the best pastry they offered. I can't believe they would rather produce more cinnamon socials and completely not make the old fashioned. The old fashioned social with its delicious marzipan, almonds and crunchy sugar topping over a soft croissant like bread was my go to selection at Ole and Steen. Can't believe they won't even make ONE old-fashioned a day yet they still advertise it on their website. Have been disappointed in the recent changes to their offerings but most disappointed in the removal of the old fashioned social from the menu. BRING IT BACK!!!"
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-06-02,3.0,"Very confusing layout, because as soon as you walk to counter in the confusing layout, We had to wait two minutes for one of the five people to come and take our order. Staff seemed disorganized. 

We both got the coffee, but unfortunately they were out of the yogurt although it had only been five minutes since you're opening because they did not prepare it before hand.

Ambiance is nice, and place is modern and clean.  Maybe will come back if it's convenient."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-09-13,3.0,"This is a cool coffee shop that is in a large location with pastries, coffees, and sandwiches and salads.

The coffee and pastries are just ok but the location and size of the cafe makes it the perfect location for an impromptu coffee meeting."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-11-09,5.0,"My friend and I were stoked to find Ole & Steen across from our hotel! It's a nice change from the Starbucks found on every other corner. The space is industrial and modern, but warm and welcoming at the same time. The menu is simple and they have both breakfast and lunch foods as well. The kind ladies working there were sweet and gave their feedback on which pastries were their favorites. We went with the Kloben Bun and Cinnamon Social Slice. The Cinnamon slice was the winner as the Kloben had a strong Cardamom taste that we didn't love as much. Our chamomile tea was delicious and served in a cute ceramic thermos thing with our cup on top. This place is a great find and I highly recommend it!"
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2020-04-26,3.0,"I didn't like the service here, this was my first time coming in and I was hoping to get some suggestions on the products and what's what... the girls at the counter didn't seem to know what went into which pastie and which was most popular even. I didn't get any suggestions so I picked what looked good to me personally and didn't really enjoy the taste as much as I thought I would. I'm shocked that the people at the front don't know much about the products. I will not be returning here."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-09-23,5.0,"Came in on a Saturday morning while doing some weekend errands. Really like the decor and the size is huge. Plenty of seats to get some reading done, comfy and cozy seats and couches, clean and modern decor. 

The cinnamon social was huge, way larger than advertised. There was an overwhelming amount of baked good choices which is a great problem to have, and a few very tasty looking sandwiches. Coffee was standard, nothing special but also nothing to complain about. I'll have to come back to try out their very extensive bakery list."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2020-01-21,4.0,Concept is great. Everything looks yummy. Had a few desserts and noticed they are a bit heavy. Like it but don't love it. Maybe I have to try some other stuff   Heard bread is good too.
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-06-07,5.0,"I was in midtown today so I was glad to see an Ole & Steen so I could get a loaf of Skagen bread, chocolate rye and some strawberry tarts.  Nice selection of pastries.  Great restrooms too ."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-12-20,5.0,"Their bread-pastries are delicious - I love the vanilla custard pastry, but there are many others. I don't like their desserts as much. I love the interior design. Their coffee is also good. While it is a bit expensive, it is in line with other bakeries and everything always tastes very clean and fresh."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-06-19,4.0,"So my first time here was via a yelp event held at their Flatiron location. I loved my experience there last time that I decided to get breakfast at their Lexington location before my flight to Dallas. My flight was at noon so I had to inhale my food but all was good. 

I got this open-face sandwich. It was sourdough, smashed avocado, and poached egg topped with course salt and pepper flakes. Can we just talk about how the bread was delicious? I can! I love love love bread. Baguette is my main and any other crusty bread is the side piece. However, I did not mind this side piece that day. The drippy egg yolk on the sourdough bread with a heap of avocado, my goodness, makes you so grateful for waking up this morning! 

I also got this little dessert, which I've had in the past (from the Yelp event), but it tasted a bit different. I am not sure if it is because this time around it was a lot bigger than the ones served at the event, but I sort of liked them when they were smaller. However, nonetheless good. It was a sponge cake crust with pecan pie like filling in the middle with all sorts of nuts topped with either nutella or chocolate. Those who like German chocolate cake or pecan pie, this should be up your alley. Well... unless you are allergic to nuts...but then yet, why are you having the other two if that is the case. 

Overall, this place is a gem and I look forward to getting a crusty piece of sourdough, which they are known for, spreading some butter, and topping it with course salt once my six week cleanse is over."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-05-18,4.0,"I'm surprised by the current low rating as I enjoyed my workday lunch there. It's a welcome change from the usual Midtown options. It combines the pastries of Maison Keyser with the sandwiches of Pret A Manger in a nice cafe setting. 

The raspberry jam in the danish was divine. The roast beef sandwich warmed up nicely so that the beef was tender while the bread was crusty. 

Would go again, especially for a longer lunch break where I could linger over a coffee and pastry."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-10-28,5.0,"I discovered this place as it was super close to my office. Their coffee, iced teas are excellent. Their pastries are quite delicious  and unique as well: my favorites are the chocolate bun, cinnamon swirl, chocolate swirl, raspberry tart.

Aside from having fresh delicious pastries and place being spotless clean and modern, the people that work there are wonderful. This is written for a manager (Danish young man) that worked there this past Sunday Oct 27th, 2019. I bought 12 pastries or so and he was asking me if we were having a party, I noted that it was for my grandmother undergoing cancer treatment at MSK and to make her feel good as she loves their pastries. Upon learning that, he threw in 4 of her favorite pastries for free!!! How kind and amazing is this person??? I would want them working for my company any day, because they won a customer for life!"
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-05-02,4.0,"Ole & Steen is a Danish bakery and cafe on the north west corner of Lexington and 48th. It is a beautiful space that is super inviting, cozy yet modern, and has great food to boost. Ole & Steen offers sandwiches and soups, pastries and porridge, juices and espresso drinks. Prices are fair for the neighborhood, and I can see this being very popular with tourists staying nearby or needing a break. 

Ordering is a bit confusing, as there are a few registers at the counter and no logical line. Pick any register at the counter as it doesn't seem to matter. The cashier will give you a number so they can deliver to the table or hand you a take out bag/tray for pastries. I was surprised at how poor the crowd management was.  

Seating is ample and comfortable, and with the big windows on to Lex and 48, its sunny and great for people watching. Seats are separated to a big communal table, window bar stools, eight two tops, and bar seating for 6 in the middle. I am pretty sure there is wifi. Bathrooms are up a few stairs but there is a chair lift.

I will vouch that the toasted chicken sandwich with shaved brussel sprouts was excellent - I'm looking forward to trying more things (especially pastries!!)"
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-04-18,5.0,"New store just open today! It's near my work so I was eager to check it out. They didn't promote it but you will get free coffee today, regardless of purchasing any other food items. 

I ordered iced Americano to go. They use paper straw so that's nice, but paper straw will get saggy in the drink after a while... Coffee was smooth, not like smoky charcoal from Starbucks. 

For food. I ordered rye toast with poached egg, kale, butternut squash and sunflower seeds. I waited for about 25 minutes for the toast. It's their open day and the store is so packed with long lines, so I can understand. My toast tastes very good, but poached eggs don't have that runny yolk, it's all solid, overcooked. 

I definitely will come back to check out other bakeries and food."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-11-02,4.0,"Love this Danish bakery chain that's moved to NYC! 2 locations - midtown and union square - both excellent. I highly recommend the cinnamon social - a braided cinnamon treat. Much like a cinnamon roll but somehow with more cinnamon flavor and so ooey gooey. I also recommend getting tea - I ordered a London fog (early grey with steamed milk). They serve it in a ceramic thermos with tea and at a cup of steamed milk stacked on top, and then your cup stacks on as well."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-10-01,4.0,"Its a little too big and chain store like for me. I like small independent cozy neighborhood places. But hey, in midtown Manhattan on Lexington Ave... this is not an easy thing to find... so given the area...I would have to say this place was pretty good. And I guess their style fits the midtown vibe well. What do I know? Im just a tourist. 
They are Danish bakery/ cafe and they have a HUGE selection baked goods sweet and savory, plus more hearty and healthy meals.  We just got two breakfast type sandwiches which were really good. The coffee was also good.
It should be noted that when I visited ole & Steen it was jam packed! They were incredibly busy with all manner of workers taking early lunches and swarms of tourists, etc.. But the staff was really friendly, patient, helpful and fast.
I also went to the one by Bryant Park just for coffee. Perfectly acceptable. Next time Im in midtown I will definitely go back for breakfast. There is a lot I wanted to try."

Great desserts ! Very quiet place! Speak easy for Sure!"
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-05-02,3.0,"Large, posh space with a large selection of delightful Danish treats.  Minimalistic decoration and quiet corners make this the perfect place to catch up with a coworker or get some work done while enjoying something sweet and simple on the side. 

The cinnamon social slice is a popular choice; it's sweet, flaky, and can be pulled apart easily- can't complain."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2020-02-09,4.0,GoodDanish pastry - definitely authentic in taste but the price almost makes a flight home to purchase  worthwhile.
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-11-02,2.0,"We walked in on Saturday afternoon. The place was pretty empty with plenty of tables available. The server left half of the focaccia filling on the cutting board. Filling for both focaccias wasn't good. I liked focaccia itself but not the filling. For 10 dollars each, it wasn't a good deal. Chocolate swirl pastry was burned on the bottom and over backed. Cinnamon pastry was decent. Maybe it's better in the morning when everything is fresh."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-08-14,3.0,"I must admit the interior design is really pretty, and the pastries are also very delicious ( love their chocolate bun! ), but the coffee is bad, it tastes like water without any flavors in it. The layout for order can not be any more inconvenient and confusing, i don't think who ever designed the interior really thought about it through. In addition, because they put all of the breads behind the counter which makes me really difficult to see what I want while ordering. The staffs are not too friendly either."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-11-10,5.0,I wanted to eat everything! I am often disappointed when I purchase an item that looks tasty but ends up underwhelming. Not the case here; the Kloben bun was soft on the inside with just the right amount of sweetness provided by the plump raisins and crunchy sugar. My cappuccino was satisfying and decorated with a heart! A great way to start the day!
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-08-29,5.0,"I bought breakfast for my office and it was extremely well received. I was able to get a nice spread of breakfast rolls and pastries within budget and everything was eaten immediately. The red currant muffins with hazelnut were especially good and the breakfast rolls were warm and filling. 

There was a slight snag when Ole & Steen had a delivery mishap and some of the items I wanted weren't available but they still had a good selection of breakfast items so overall, the replacements ended up being delicious and nobody in the office was the wiser. Jefferey was very helpful in arranging the breakfast and getting everything sorted out so I had a good customer service experience in what would have otherwise been a stressful breakfast run. I would definitely return the next time I need to pick up food for a large group of people."

967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-08-07,5.0,"Came here on a Monday after work. Was looking for something similar in texture and taste to the bread I used to get from my baker in my tiny hometown in Poland.....Ive tried countless bakeries. This is at the top of my list. . Susan was fantastic.PS-they are a cashless bakery. 

PPS-Bread is 3 days old and definitely still good for sandwiches. French toast the rest tomorrow!"

967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-08-19,5.0,Stopped in here for a quick breakfast the other day and it was great. I had the egg sandwich along with some tea. The service was fast and the restaurant was very clean (including the bathroom). Can't wait to stop in here again.
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-06-24,5.0,"I have never seen so many interesting pastries.  While standing in line briefly, an employee asked if i had any questions or if i wanted to see the menu.  I asked about one of the donuts, then asked if it was better than the cinnamon swirl.  He answered honestly and emphatically that the cinnamon swirl was better.  I appreciated his honesty.  

I also ordered an iced americano.  Both the coffee and pastry were amazing.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a coffee or pastry in the area.  I'll be walking a few extra blocks to get my coffee here, but  it will be worth it."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2020-01-04,3.0,"Meh, interior is nice, set up modern, plenty of tables and bar space, but it's all downhill from there. They have a selection of sandwiches which are all cold, and contain ingredients as if they borrowed, but not enough. The pastries are OK, Super heavy on the sugar but maybe that's to mask the stale taste. The coffee is really good though, like really good, not the craftsmanship but the quality of the coffee. Probably wouldn't return unless I was super hungry and stuck in area."
967,ole-and-steen-new-york-4,2019-05-29,4.0,"Hoping that this place would feature dark Scandinavian style whole grain dark breads, I waited with baited breath. And sure enough, there are many to choose from ""chia rye,"" ""carrot rye,"" ""soft rye"" and two others whose names I have misplaced for now. There is also Skagen, a light rye bread, a cut above most served in this burg. The dark rye breads are dense, moist and freeze well - if you've a small household cut the loaf in half and freeze some for later. The pleasant servers bag them nicely. The seeded rolls are excellent but I've learned they are too dense for sandwich use - have yours with good butter.

I have tried a few of the pastries - the Kobenhavnr is the poppy seed specialty usually known as a tebirkes. The version here did not blow me away. The chocolate bun was better - packed with good quality chips. I have also had the breakfast sandwich, egg, cheese, Danish ham on a bun - at $5 a relative bargain. I don't think the coffee is worth the $4 price tag, there are better java options in the area.

But those wonderful dark breads are a raison d'etre and then some. Try them."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-03-12,5.0,"After coming back from a show , the kids wanted something sweet and as this bakery was right next door for our hotel we decided to pay it is visit!

The window is filled with cakes and macaroons but for us, the standout was spotted as we walked inside - the Cronut! They look hard and dry but do  not be fooled, they are delicious, lights, crumbly and fresh! Wish we had purchased more!! 

We also picked up 2 cheesecakes - a caramel and an Oreo.. Both really good and very rich! And a bright layer cake, that was way too sweet for my liking but the kids enjoyed some of it. It was too rich to get all the way through.

Great bakery. It's small , room for 3 people to stand so best to know what you want ( you can see all the selections in the window) before you step in ! Would return in a heartbeat for those cronuts !!"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-03-29,4.0,"We were hanging out around Times Square and was craving some dessert.  We saw this bakery nearby and went inside just to ""look"". The interior is very small so takeout is your only option.  They have a variety of cakes, cupcakes and other sweets.

They have an awesome cake deal of 3 slices for $20.  There were three of us so we went for it.  We had a chocolate fudge, strawberry shortcake and tiramisu.  All were moist and worth every calorie.  The strawberry shortcake was the favorite because it was the least decadent.  The fresh strawberries were sweet.  The white cake was soft and melts in your mouth.  

If you're in the area and want to satisfy your sweet tooth, Mia's Bakery is a good option.  There's always room for dessert!!"

SUPER GOOD: salted caramel cake, Black Forest cake, fruit tarts, mixed berry pie 

Nope: German chocolate cake, cherry pie, lemon bars"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-11-18,5.0,"10/26/19 - Mia's store front is one you walk by. Do a double take. Stop. And, ooooohhhh!!!!!!
That's exactly what we did, then walked right in. I wanted to try everything. From all the different slices of cakes I did try, they were all great. If you have a sweet tooth, go to Mia's. Would I go there again? Absolutely.
Happy Eats"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-02-28,4.0,"It may be in the middle of time square, but it's a taste of upscale Brooklyn bakery. The cheesecakes are dense and rich and delicious, but you've got to try the kronuts. I swear from the outside they look like they're so dry you'd need a gallon of milk just to get them down, but the inside is flaky and buttery and soft and moist and delicious and... you get the point. My opinion is vanilla beats coconut beats caramel beats chocolate beats strawberry. Maybe I should go back and try the Nutella?"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-02-01,5.0,"For the classic cheesecake--if the signature of Junior's is dense and classical, Eileen's is rustic but imaginative, and Two Little Red Hens is pillowy and artisan, then Mia's is creamy and silky.

There's a feeling that the cheesecake is almost semi-liquid on your fork, but when you put it in your mouth there's still some bite. It coats your tongue like a cream and has no feeling of dryness and little viscosity in the back of your throat, which makes it really easy to eat.

The cake is too sweet for my palette, but most cake is.

I highly recommend their cheesecakes."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-07-26,5.0,"When I first saw Mia's Bakery I just walk by because I asked myself can a hole in the wall dessert shop in the middle of Times Square and the Theater District surrounded by Tourist that would eat anything be any good ?

The answer my friends is YES !!!

This shop is small I think the Fire Dept only allows 3 customers at a time in the place. But this store doesn't waste any space and they got a lot of good looking desserts to pick from.

The staff was friendly and patient while I looked around and took photos. The main desserts are $7.50 each 3 for $20 , I been eating all day so I only took two, a traditional Strawberry Short cake and a Fruit Napoleon..

The Short cake was fresh and delicious, what you expect from a good bakery. The Napoleon was huge, I felt I can only eat some of it so I cut off a third and ate that saving the rest for another day. It was flaky, creamy and had fresh berries spread around in it and a big Strawberry on top. But five minutes later I took another third, and another five minutes after that I ate the last third.

I ate the hole thing I could not leave it alone. :)

I was pleasantly surprised by Mia's Bakery, it will be hard to walk by Mia's again and not go in."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-01-15,3.0,"Having been to another Mia's in Brooklyn,I kind of expected the deserts to be too sweet . Low and behold it's exactly the same overly sweet(my opinion) deserts at this location. I suspect the Brooklyn location supplies the store with the goods as there was no signs of any ovens and no bakery scent !

I still went ahead and ordered their strawberry cheese cake and creme brûlée cupcake . The cheesecake was very dense and like I said ,very sweet . The strawberry topping appeared incredibly gelatinous looking and tasting which ultimately  did not appeal to me in any way.I do give credit on it having a thicker than normal crust which is usually my favorite part of any cheese cake . 

The creme brûlée cupcake looked exactly like Molly's creme brûlée's cupcake . Don't know if it's a coincidence or what but it definitely didn't measure up . 

Overall, I wasn't impressed just like the lone occasion at the Brooklyn location and am convinced Mia's just isn't for me."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-02-05,4.0,"First off, this location is VERY small. I could barely move when I picked up my cake and there were about 6 other people in there with me. Other than that, the staff was really helpful and nice. Everything was nicely and clearly displayed..

 I've had Mia's lemon blueberry cake before at a party and thought it was really good. After trying their cake, I decided to get my sister a cake for her birthday. I ended up getting the strawberry shortcake and she LOVED it. I thought that the cake was just okay, nothing extraordinary.

I LOVE that they have vegan options. Can't wait to visit again to try some of their other dessert options."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-12-31,5.0,Yummy! I LOVED this place! Right in Times Square. The service was excellent. Polite quick and respectful. I had the tres leche cupcake which was excellent! Reasonable prices! Excellent quality!
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-06-11,5.0,"We needed a strawberry shortcake for a 12th birthday- the only cake we love- and our normal bakery was closed.  I gave Mia's a try and I am so happy I did.  The strawberry shortcake is light, moist and the frosting is perfect.  The strawberries were delicious and well distributed- it was a hit and so well worth it."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-12-28,5.0,This tiny little treasure is small but has big flavor. From cookies to cupcakes to macaroons you can't go wrong. I would recommend the triple leche cupcake for the win!
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-06-01,5.0,"Absolutely amazing desserts, got an oreo cheesecake, a few different cupcake varieties and a carrot cake slice and were some of the best we have ever had. They were super friendly and great conversation. This is right outside the entrance to the Renaissance hotel and amazing to go there and then back to the hotel."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-12-10,5.0,"Amazing! Super tiny, easy-to-miss bakery just off of times square. Do be aware there is no seating - barely enough space for three people. 
Service was great, everyone was super nice. Food is not only gorgeous, but delicious. Their croissant was AMAZING. So flaky and light and just *kisses fingers* perfect. I got the chocolate fudge cake, and it was a lot fudgier than I was expecting! A bit rich for my taste, but delicious nonetheless."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-05-13,2.0,"Came in for a Nutella cronut and I was devastated they didn't have it. Next option , red velvet cupcake.  Ran out. Seriously ? What did they have ? I settled for an Oreo cupcake. I was super excited since I thought it was going to be amazing but I was very disappointed. The frosting was super dense and it tasted a lot like cream cheese. I didn't really get why it was called an Oreo cheesecake since it was lacking that flavor. The only Oreo I tasted was the Oreo placed on top.

Wasn't very satisfied. Also the workers there weren't that attentive. They helped someone else first who got their after me. Rude. =\"

OVERALL: 7.4/10

Surprisingly, this place has DECENT rainbow cookies... best ones I've had so far would be from @royal_crown_si
And surprisingly Brooklyn bakery is in time square ‍

FOOD: 7.4/10

I'd say I liked their cakes quite alright... their creme brulee cupcake was UHMAZING. Their rainbow cookies were pretty good, hard to find. Their strawberry cheesecake didn't taste as well as @juniorscheesecake
But it got my sweet tooth feeling alright. Same with the black out and carrot cake. 

SERVICE: not a service place. 

CLEANLINESS: 10/10

ATMOSPHERE: not a restaurant... The place is small as ‿... But ya really small.

968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-03-29,4.0,"Having a hankering for cake, I sought out Mia's Bakery after reading positive yelp reviews and its proximity to my route to the Port Authority.

This location in the theatre district is small and pretty much take out only with just a 5ft. wide counter area for quick bites. The majority of the store is devoted to displaying their multitude of offerings of which can be a bit daunting to choose amongst.

Scanning the available cake slices I selected one of my favorites in a slice of Blackout cake and also a slice of 7-layer cake for my sister.

Each was packaged efficiently and neatly making it easy to transport without fear of damage.


Blackout cake 4.5/5.0: What a near spot on rendition of this classic cake! From the thickness of both the cake and pudding layers, to the crumbled cake bits sprinkled onto the outer layer, a google image search for Blackout cake would mirror Mia's version. Taste wise it was superb........

The cake portion was moist, not overly sweet, and having a nice cocoa flavor.

At first I mistook the pudding layer as frosting, but a quick swipe with a fork revealed a thicker and creamier consistency in line with a pudding. The pudding was worthy of eating on it's own, rich and milky with a distinct milk chocolate flavor.

7-Layer cake 3.5/5.0: My sister's take on this cake wasn't nearly as positive as my Blackout cake. While still yummy, several negative factors arose.

Firstly it was definitely a sweet cake. The buttercream frosting was a little too sweet making it hard to eat a large portion. Secondly, being a 7-Layer cake, there was a lot of the frosting.

On the positive end the yellow cake was excellent being very moist and buttery.


Some negatives, but that Blackout Cake really made my visit to Mia's worth it."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-09-14,4.0,"Tiny, tiny, tiny little shop but they have the same treats as the Brooklyn location. There's about enough room for 4 customers in here. They do have a big selection for the small space. 

The croissant donut here is just okay. Nothing special unless you've never had one before. 
Their Brooklyn Blackout cake is amazing, but extremely rich. One piece is enough to split with two people! 
They do have a special, 3 slices of cake for $20, if you want to try a bunch of things. 

They were out of cold brew when I got there (about 11:30am on a Friday morning) and gave me Nitro instead. Their nitro has a very full flavor and keeps the foamy head for a long time. 

I was given spoons instead of forks for my treats, which was a little weird. Overall, the employees were nice and the offerings are good!"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-08-10,5.0,What's better than Oreo cheesecake at 1am?? I'll wait. This bakery is super cute and convenient as it was located right next to my hotel in Times Square. There's no long review needed....THIS PLACE IS BOMB YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE. Let this be your confirmation!
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-01-31,5.0,"Finally got a legit dessert spot in Times Square. I have been going to their original Brooklyn location and it has all the dessert you could want from cakes to pies to donuts. 

This location is really small unlike the other one which makes sense because it's basically right in Times Square. So it's a grab and go place with all the items displayed nicely where you can peek at them from the door when you are passing by. 

They do their own variation of the donut/croissant merge aka ""Cronut"" which is surprisingly really good and doesn't require you to come early in the morning unlike Dominique Ansel. I tried the salted caramel and the glaze on top is heavenly and so it the croissant donut itself. Also got the blueberry cheesecake which stood its own and is something I would definitely have again. Their chocolate fudge cake is great too, basically everything is good here lol

So if you are in Times Square, this is a must try and it's open late at night too."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-07-30,4.0,"If you didn't know better (I actually had no idea), you would think this is just another sweet-spot established in the middle of Midtown-Theater District-Rockefeller vicinity to purposely target infinite number of suckers, I mean tourists. The tiny shop only have enough room for maybe 6 or 7 persons to stand and place order. It's a grab-and-go concept, so you can forget about sittin'-and-sippin' your cappuccino. 

On the contrary, the original Mia's Bakery is a spacious restaurant-cafe based in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. It also offers 10x the pastry selections including tarts, pies, cakes, cookies, brownies, gelatos, breakfast items, sandwiches and beverages... so this one here in Midtown is merely a mini-me. Don't be fooled by either the touristy spot or flashy appearance... because the cakes are GOOD! Be sure to bring a friend or two and take advantage of their special cake promotions: 3 slices for $20 or 5 slices for $30. I suppose I'm a sucker for Mia's Bakery too!"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-08-18,5.0,"Had to try a Cronut while is town. The Nutella did NOT let me down!! Wow so good. Service was awesome as well. Very friendly staff. Loved my experience. 

FYI it's easy to miss the store bc it's so small!"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-02-02,4.0,"Saw a new dessert place open in Midtown.  Finally got a chance to try it since I want a snack.

Employees will ask if you need any help so don't be shy to ask any questions you have.

Overload of cake options!  Should I be greedy and get 3?  Hmm...nah, I better share it since I want to try everything.  Next time.

Cupcakes: Nutella or Cookies & Cream?  Hmm...the employees both say Nutella!  You can guess what I got.  Love the Nutella cupcake ($3.25)!  The only downside is the frosting is a bit too sweet for me so try for yourself and don't go by me unless you have the same sweet tooth as me.

Can't wait to try the other items."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-12-01,5.0,Went here off of reviews as we wanted a solid dessert in the Times Square area that wasn't a tourist trap. This was  absolutely worth a visit and will be back!!! We couldn't decide on just one so we got several!! We have a Magnolia in our neighborhood but would choose Mia's over Magnolia ANY DAY!!!
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-12-03,4.0,"I decided to get a red velvet cupcake when walking past because their offerings looked terrific, and I wasn't hungry enough to get a full slice of cake. I wish I could've ordered one of everything based solely on how pretty it all was. The cupcake I got was wonderful, but the extra icing I would've received within the cake would have been the perfect amount. I'd suggest getting a full slice and committing to the sweets whenever you go!"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-07-23,4.0,"Shop is much smaller than I expected, staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  I was pretty full from dinner so I only picked up one item to go.  I got the chocolate croissant doughnut.  Layers were flaky and the chocolate frosting was tasty, I also appreciated the little crispy pearls?  My only gripe is I wish there was frosting in the layers as well.  Was disappointed the nutella croissant doughnut was sold out but this was a pretty good consolation prize."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-07-16,4.0,"Flat/borderline rude service ...but the dessert was great. Strawberry shortcake was so bomb !

Disclaimer:I bought this at 10pm maybe the day staff are nicer."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-11-18,5.0,"Once again, I have to give credit where it's due... Thank you to the Yelpers who have left this bakery such great reviews. I used Yelp.com to help me find a bakery near my job that I can order a cake for my dad's birthday this past weekend. I found Mia's in the results. I contacted them via their website to ask them for what I needed. I received a response right away from Stamatis who was extremely helpful. I was able to place my order and pay for the cake right on their website which was very convenient. I received a confirmation promptly. On Saturday, when I went to go pick-up the cake, the staff was very friendly and the cake was beautiful. Everyone in my family loved the cake. Mia's is highly recommended. I will be back to try some of their other goodies. FYI - I ordered their 7"" lemon cake (minus the blueberries). See pic."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-11-14,5.0,These are the moistest cakes and cake pops that I have ever tasted! So good! And the staff is so friendly if you are ever in Time square you have to go to Mia's Bakery it's just de-liish!!! I would have posted pix but they were so good we ate them!
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-10-02,5.0,"Tiny, tiny shop on the north side of Times Square a block up from the quasi-food truck vendors and the grandstand. Don't let this tiny shop fool you.  They have a fantastic selection for a shop that maybe can fit 2 ppl comfortably.  Why do I say this?  Cause I was there w/3 one day & I was bumped & jostled like the 2 train just before rush hour picks up.

Light & flaky butter croissants - check.  When walking 13 miles a day, I think I'll have 2 :)  

Cronuts in a variety of flavors even left a couple for the hotel staff.  Is it 1 a day or 2 a day will keep the dr away? 

And I have to say they most use really great flour that does not have as much gluten although no item that I had was gluten free.  My gluten sensitivity did not flare up at all the week that I went every AM for my 2 croissants & for dessert at night we split a cronut.  

Can't wait for the next trip to try some of the other tarts & delicacies that looked beyond yummy :)"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-04-19,4.0,"Review is from 12/19/2018:

I have been dying to go here just for the nutella croissant donut, & my expectations did not get the best of me! It was truly SO good, I was very impressed. We also got the coconut cream slice which was incredibly moist & very yummy. The location definitely was the reason was shop was so tiny, 4 customers barely fit, but I guess this would be great for when you're with tourists & want to pop in. Can't wait to go to the original location & get a seat with all the yummys!"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-10-04,4.0,This place is magical! It's a small bakery near Times Square and it's got a wide variety of desserts. You name it and they have it. The staff is so good there. Super friendly and sweet. They always suggest some really good options according to my preferences. My favourite here is the Nutella Cronut. It's heavenly! It's just so perfect. Every bite of it feels so so good. You must try this place whenever you're around.
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-11-23,4.0,"Solid bakery with a wide range of choices and despite being right next to Times Square the prices aren't ridiculous, I tried the kronut and one of the cupcakes and thought both were pretty good. Definitely worth the try and a recommendation from me."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-10-07,5.0,"We got the coconut cake and chocolate cake it was freaking delicious, even better than Carlos bakery. The coconut cake had a custard type deal between the layers and it was so freaking good. Worth every penny! I highly recommend you guys go check this one out. Sorry we smashed the caked too quick to get pictures."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-03-10,4.0,"They even have vegan/gluten free section! The vegan almond pastry I get is amazing! Not too sweet not too creamy. It's more expensive than Brooklyn store given it's location. Each cheesecake is ~$8. Vegan/gluten free items are $6.5. They also have cronuts! The most popular one is strawberry shortcake. Next time i will come for Napoleon cakes. The store is very tiny. No places for seating at all, and you need to buy and go."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2019-04-25,3.0,"After seeing a Broadway show, we were really craving dessert and looked up bakeries that had vegan options in the area. Excited to find this spot a short distance away from our theater!

Prices are a little steep for dessert, but predictable given that it's NYC and Times Square no less. There were about four different choices left for vegan options at the late hour that we stopped by. 

Not really a great spot to eat-in, so we each ordered a couple things and got everything to go to eat back at our hotel room. My husband was a fan of their red velvet cupcake but said their apple NY-style cheesecake wasn't that impressive because the cheesecake was crumbly rather than creamy and the apple topping wasn't that good. For me, their raspberry shortcake was a miss because the cake was dry and there was a strange aftertaste like shortening I was getting with the pink frosting. However, their chocolate mousse cake (which was recommended by their employee) was perfect and I would come back for it.

Other than what we ordered, there were some impressive-looking cake slices, pastries, cookies, and macarons. I would stop by again after seeing a show to try their other vegan offerings!"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-02-20,5.0,"Had a piece of Nutella cake yesterday, it was ""WOW"" and did not taste deadly as you would think it might, with a name like that!"
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-03-02,1.0,"The people were rude, the macaroons were hard, cheese cake bland, and it was over priced. Definitely not ever stopping here again. The guy working the counter needs to get over himself and work on his bad attitude, especially towards people just trying to buy a cookie. Never again."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-01-26,5.0,"After going and (loving) the Brooklyn location I was pleasantly surprised to discover they had a Manhattan location. I've only ordered delivery from this branch and I had a great experience. The staff was very friendly when I called to make a change to my order and even sent a cute note... a nice little touch! Everything that I've tried from this bakery is  amazing, I can't recommend anything in particular, whatever you order will be delicious! IMO, this is one of the best bakeries in NYC."
968,mia-s-bakery-new-york,2020-03-14,5.0,Very delicious fruit napoleon and surprisingly fresh pastries and cupcakes. My wife really liked the tres leches cupcake
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-05-13,5.0,"So happy I found this place during Covid! I love all the different options they have, from bubble tea to dumplings to avocado toast. I've gotten the egg, avocado, tomato on bagel and on a croissant. I've also gotten the avocado toast with boiled egg. All are so good! I haven't found anything I didn't like. They add a little cup of fruit or cupcake in the bag as well. I also love that they have different options for the milk. I don't find a lot of places with macadamia milk."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-06-09,5.0,"Their bubble tea, baked goods, and breakfast sandwiches are all delicious. This is one of the few coffee shops in Hells Kitchen where I can consistently find seating. I love their outdoor area in the back as well! A great place to work or sit with friends."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-01-25,3.0,"Came here to get a coffee, and were just about to order from the cashier when the owner interrogated us, asking ""stay or go?"" We said stay. Then she said ""the waitress will seat you."" Excuse me? I just wanted to sit down for a bit with a coffee, not go through the formalities of waiter service. 

Then we were ushered to a table and given a menu that doesn't have any coffee or tea items on it, only food items. I guess seating is only for people who are ordering food now? Kind of defeats the idea of a coffee shop. 

When this place opened it was a nice new addition to the neighborhood. The coffee is good and the staff are super nice, and I liked the idea of supporting an independent operation instead of a big franchise. But the owner is making the experience uncomfortable lately. Frankly I feel more at ease in a Starbucks now than I do at UT47. Sad to see a good place lose its charm."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-01-25,3.0,"I used to see this as a good option to  pop by occasionally, but when I recently came and took out my kindle to read while waiting a friend, I was told that no computers are allowed. That + the fact that it has a credit card minimum above the price of an average coffee unfortunately means I'll be going elsewhere 

I would rather they increase their prices or enforce some sort of time limit instead of preventing me from reading while waiting"
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-12-29,4.0,"If you're looking for a spot where you can either enjoy a cup of coffee with a friend, or grab some bomb dishes with an Asian twist this is definitely your place. I've never been to UT47 before and actually ended up choosing based on proximity to my apartment but I'm actually glad I did! The food and atmosphere made for the perfect spot to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen for some time.

We arrived around 10:30 in the morning on a Saturday. I was the first to arrive in our party and since we all weren't there they asked me to wait in the front of the store before going to the general seating area. Once we were all there we ordered at the counter in the front and were allowed to go seat ourselves while they made our dishes. 

The space is organized into two sections. The entrance area has some small coffee tables and the counter for ordering. The seating area has both an indoor and covered outdoor section where you're able to enjoy your dishes and beverages. We opted to sit inside and had a lot of seating options since it was still early.

I ended up going with their version of an avocado toast. Served on toasted whole wheat and topped with cut avocado slices, flax seed and a nice honey drizzle on top. It made for, honestly, one of the best versions of this classic brunch dish I've ever had. You can't go wrong if you decide to order it while here!"
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-12-21,1.0,"We came here on a Sunday afternoon, this place is very empty but they have a policy that you have to buy something to be seated. My boyfriend bought a cappuccino but they forced us to another item so that I can sit down with my boyfriend, though I don't feel like drinking coffee in the afternoon.

Just want to put it out there. This probably explains why the coffee shops a block from here are so crowded that we can't find any seat and this one is so empty.

Oh also, on weekends, no WiFi, and no computer is allowed. Just when I thought they can't take this any further... would appreciate it if you can tell your customers about your rules before they buy anything. 

Oh, ANOTHER rule, you can't bring food or drinks from outside. I'm surprised they don't have a dedicated employee going through your bags and force you empty your water bottle.

Literally, this place has more rules than my parents house. I'm overwhelmed. I'm afraid to ask about bathroom now, I'm sure they have some rules about their bathroom too on weekends.

We are not coming back."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-12-09,3.0,"UT47 has good coffee and a nice beer list. Unfortunately, they have a very strict outside food policy- even if you are a paying customer and they don't sell the said outside food. 

I guess a rule is a rule, but they probably shouldn't have been so quick to shoo out paying customers who could've purchased more, when there were plenty of empty seats."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-02-04,4.0,I stopped in here today to try their latte with almond milk. I ordered a medium latte with almond milk and it was $5.72. A little expensive for a medium. I think the owner may have made it. She was very nice! Great customer service. The flavor of the coffee was good too! I want to return to try their cappuccino. I wish they opened at 7am instead of 8am.
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-05-17,5.0,"The food was amazing and the added treats were so tasty. I can't wait to go back in order to try something else on the menu.
Also the person who took my order was super nice."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-06-27,4.0,"I've scoured their website and reviews to find out what UT stands for, and I've got nothing. Ultimate teas? Urinary tract? Uma Therman? Hoping the owner replies to this and lets me know. 

That outdoor patio in the back is a true prize. When I want to escape or have some relaxing catch-up time with a friend in midtown west, I'll definitely be keeping UT47 in mind. Just wish they put an AC or fan, because the heat is real. 

I got the ume plum honey tea, which is for the sweet-toothed people out there. And that's because it's drowning in honey, go figure. There are plums at the bottom that you can eat. That's different. I'm not sure about $4 different, but that's what you pay for specialty teas here. 

My friend got an iced cappuccino, which came in this huge glass. They actually mistakenly made it hot, but when she said that she'd wanted it iced, they happily and quickly remade it. 

They have so many options in terms of coffees, teas, food, pastries, and more. Seems like a well-rounded, cute little cafe! It's an excellent place to meet up with someone or get some work done solo dolo."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-12-10,5.0,"I love this place. Such a wonderful, welcoming staff and a great place to do a little work during the week or meet friends on the weekend. The coffee is decent and they serve incredibly delicious breakfast items - super fresh tasting ingredients, amazing flavors, and great prices and portions. I would recommend the egg-based dishes over the pastries though. You can tell a lot of love is put into the dishes here as well."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-05-23,4.0,"A relatively new cafe on 47th, on the corner of 9th ave. Plenty of seating, there's a large table accommodating 8 seats as well as about 8 more smaller tables. There's also a separate 'outdoor' space that you can sit and have your coffee. And there's a bathroom! I always hate it when I try to go to a cafe and work but find it is super small and without a restroom. Definitely a space where you can get some work done. 

The service was super friendly, by all the people working there. I would come back just for that. I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk, and while not the best, as it was a little more bitter that I would have liked, it was pretty good. I didn't order any food, but all plates I saw from other customers looked fresh and clean."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-04-06,1.0,"Great servers.  They were sweet and super friendly.  

Mediocre eats-- mostly pastries/cakes/sweets/carbs procured from outside food sources, short order cook foods (eggs, egg sandwiches, lox bagels), or uncooked (avocado and canned tuna), or microwaveable food.  

There are more seats if you wrap around the place, and even more seating in the back patio area which also has lovely plants.  

Bathroom requires a code to use--ask an employee for the code.  

What put a damper on the experience was the horrible owner.  She scolded us for bringing a birthday cake to surprise our friend because outside food is prohibited.  We didn't know, so the only thing we could do was apologize profusely, but the owner was relentless and rude.  She also suggested we should tip more because for reservations, they typically expect each person to spend at least $15.  We put an extra $20 in the tip jar (more for the nice waitresses on her staff) despite the fact that we had already tipped 20 percent of the bill, however, we will not return and would advise others to beware."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-01-09,4.0,"Cute coffee place with PLENTY of seating, including a back area with heaters and a cute Christmas tree! Great for a place to catch up with a friend over coffee, you can definitely enjoy your time there. Plus, the interior was so cutely decorated!"
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-02-28,3.0,"I used to come here all the time. It's close to my apartment and had a really nice homey feeling to it. But recently there have been more and more rules about what you can and cannot do. No laptops on weekends has made the place completely empty. I am really sad to say I won't be going any time soon. 
The place is really quite big for New York with good seating options. Their drinks were really good and their food ok. The space outside was really nice."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-03-14,5.0,"This is a gem of a place! The food is awesome and the staff is very welcoming. My wife and I have been coming here every week ever since we discovered this place a few months back. They have a great selection of food items as well as many flavorful drink options. Mia, one of the servers, is excellent! She knows our drink and food orders and makes certain everything is just to our liking. We're so glad we found UT47. It is now part of our weekend routine!"
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-02-21,5.0,"Was staying in New York and this place had the best tomato soup and grilled cheese i've ever had in my life. Super sweet ladies working here, very welcoming and helpful. The breakfast is also amazing, perfectly poached eggs and super ripe fruit. I honestly don't know how they do it. They also have outdoor seating in the back with very pretty decor which would be great for summer! i would give this place 10/10 if i could, that's how much i love it."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-03-11,5.0,Great place to sit and drink. Food was excellent and also the bubble tea. The matcha was a little bit too week for my taste.

Amazing spot to stop by for breakfast - their bagel sandwich was excellent and everything comes with a little side of fruits and honey which was a pleasant surprise. Outside patio is sooo nice, great anytime of day. Just a bit warmer than other cafes tend to be (and a couple more bugs too) but not enough to take away from the pleasant environment."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-01-19,5.0,"I can't express just how lucky me, as a vegan, and my friends are finding this wonderful restaurant in hells kitchen. Me and some friends have breakfast gathering and always head to UT47 because they have Vegan options like Homemade vegan cream cheese, roasted beet hummus and dairy-free sun-dried tomato pesto. I got their Vegan grilled cheese with Vegan tomato soup and I loved it. 
I've been coming for almost a year now and I really like how they always update the Vegan, Gluten-free and Dairy-free options to their menu. The environment and staff are very friendly, we always see the same staffs whenever we go there, seems like they been working there for a long time."

969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-10-16,4.0,"- Cute little spot in Hell's Kitchen
- Got the tea pot for 2 and we chose the Ume Plum Honey
- It was really sweet and refreshing 
- Perfect for a cold day
- They have tables inside where you can get some work done and a large area at the back with seating
- Good spot to come with some friends and catch up
- Would come back to try their bubble tea and food"

I reminded the barista what I was ordered, but she was insisted on she put less ice in the tea. Oh additionally paper straw melted in 2 minutes hence I couldn't even get the bobas."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2018-11-28,5.0,"This place is a gem in Hell's Kitchen! The cafe has a really clean and calming atmosphere. I've gone both for leisure and to do work. There has been a table for me each time I've visited. There is also fast and stable wifi, as well as clean restrooms (which is definitely a plus at busy NYC cafes) which are both password protected. There's also a really nice and small outdoor area that's open during the warmer months.

The cafe has a wide range of traditional hot and iced teas, but they also have a nice assortment of Korean teas. When this place first opened, the owner introduced herself to me and created a few mixed teas for me during the initial times I visited. She and all of the other staff are always very friendly and helpful. I am also a huge fan of London Fogs (since I don't drink coffee) and they are always more than happy to make it, despite the fact that it's not on the menu. They also have a nice assortment of pastries and typical cafe, breakfast-type fare. 

I am a regular here and would definitely recommend trying this place if you're in the Hell's Kitchen area!"
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-09-02,3.0,"3.5 stars

Was in the neighborhood pretty early and looking for a place to have a quick drink. This place showed up on Yelp. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by the selection of breakfast foods and drinks, including boba. Unfortunately, we had just eaten so we decided to go with 2 bottles of beers from Maine Beer Co (these were particularly interesting and stood out among the rest of the American beer selection). Well they ended up begin $16 a bottle, lol ooops (would've been nice to see a price list somewhere) but they were big bottles. We found a beautiful area / terrace to sit and hang out in the back."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-01-27,5.0,"This is my newest and favorite cafe in Hell Kitchen. The atmosphere is pleasant, the Owner and staff are friendly and always glad you came, they treat guests like family. The coffee is good especially the lattes and the pastries and breakfast sandwiches a delight to the eyes and delicious. Also when you go around the wall here is a large seating area, table for two or six and they even have a small patio. Worth coming too. Best breakfast n lunch experience in midtown Manhattan/ Hells Kitchen!"
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-01-01,5.0,"My first Yelp review goes to UT47 for their tasty tuna egg croissant sandwich! The boiled egg and honey mustard (?) spread was the perfect touch. I visited them on Christmas day, where the workers provided a warm welcome. The cute cafe has a patio in the back as well. Side note: make sure to order first and then find a seat because some spaces are reserved for groups!"
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-01-15,4.0,"4.5  I needed to spend some time one afternoon before meeting up with some friends for dinner. UT47 was an absolute gem to find! I had their taro milk tea boba and it was very yummy! The taro was creamy and flavorful and I was able to get it made with soy milk! They had quite a few milk options like almond, macadamia, oat, and hemp seed. They are very vegan/vegetarian overall! The boba itself was cooked all the way through and on the soft side and it was not chewy. I could definitely taste the tapioca flavor! It was served in the cutest glass with a big metal straw. There is a little bit of an awkward fit between the straw and some bubbles so I had some less graceful but comical spillage! Make sure you find some napkins. The space is a big U shape with the counter/bar on one side and seating on the other. There is also a back closed-roof patio with some cozy seating too. The  bathroom code is on the receipt and the room was clean and vibing. There is also the wifi password on the receipt."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-08-13,4.0,"UT47 is a great study spot in Midtown! They have coffee, sandwiches, and a range of baked pastries. I ordered a vanilla iced coffee and it was around $4. Pretty standard pricing for Manhattan. I've also had their tuna salad sandwich, which was lackluster but very healthy. The food is a minor concern of mine since I would come here primarily to get studying done. They have great lighting and a good amount of seating. The order counter is around the corner from the seating area, which minimizes distractions. Bathrooms are clean and easily accessible, and staff are very friendly. Traffic isn't too heavy on weekdays so you can study in peace and quiet."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-05-17,5.0,"My boyfriend and I come here every now and then, and every time we leave, ask ourselves ""why don't we come here more often?!"".  Their cold brew and ginger honey tea is always amazing, and their croissant egg sandwiches are the best I've ever had.   Not to mention their cozy space in the back, which provides the perfect atmosphere to slow down, have a nice conversation, and enjoy their delicious menu items. The staff is super friendly, and even slips extra treats if they are busy and there was a small wait for your food (well worth the wait though)!  Thank you UT47 for always hitting the spot, and putting that extra bit of care into what you do, that so many places in NYC lack.  A true gem in Hell's Kitchen!"
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-12-21,1.0,"Good coffee but they're rigid with the rules. Came here and order 2 drinks and they said my girlfriend must order something. 

After getting an additional item they still required that my girlfriend must get an item herself and that 2 items for me isn't sufficient. 

It's not a big deal but just doesn't feel right. I'm surprised that they didn't check to make she was the one who consumed her item. But coffee is pretty good.

Also, just found out no laptops or WiFi on weekends. Not sure about smaller electronics."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2018-12-30,4.0,"Great little coffee place I visited last night in Hell's Kitchen. I was craving something to wake me up,
so I quickly Yelped coffee places and this one popped up. Seems like they stay open than most coffee places around here which is great. What a treat! 

It's a quaint coffee shop with a nicely decorated interior, as well as an area for customers to eat/drink outside as well. Quiet and respectful mix of people too. I spoke with the owner a bit, and her and the staff are super sweet. My guest and I couldn't make up our minds so she suggested the house ginger coffee as well as a chai tea latte for us to try. We also ordered a passion fruit macaroon to try, which had a nice texture and wasn't super sweet. All in all this little cafe was a great way to unwind and take a load off from the hustle and bustle of the outside and busy New York streets. Will make sure I visit again if I'm craving a pick me up drink."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-04-12,3.0,"This rating is purely based on the bubble tea / aesthetic of the shop.

Boba: 1/5, barely passable. Four of us got boba and none of us finished our tea. The tea itself was quite strong, which is good, but had little other flavor. The tapioca balls were probably the worst I've ever had - they were just wet and disgustingly chewy with no flavor. Would 100% skip.

Aesthetic = 5/5, looks like a cute place to chill for a bit or even work for the day. I'll definitely come back to try something different.

SKIP THE BOBA IT'S TERRIBLE"
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-04-15,2.0,"A very unpleasant experience at UT47
I ordered a hot chocolate and started working about 11am. Till 4:50pm I've been ask 3 times whether I need something or not. I said I'm ok for now but that Korean old lady just keep asking. And the last time she even checked my receipt and said ""on my""... guess just shocked by the fact that I sit here for a very long time but only had 1 drink. Or another way ask me to leave? 
Objectively, 1 star for the hot chocolate and the other for its maker."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-01-12,4.0,"Cute little coffee shop/eatery. We tried the bulgogi tacos and the avocado toast. The food was nothing special, but definitely tasty and prepare quickly.

I especially enjoyed the atmosphere of this restaurant. There is a cute little sun room in the back which has a heater so you could enjoy in the winter. It was nice to be able to eat outside.

Definitely a cute place for a coffee or a nice little meetup"
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-04-16,5.0,"Wow what a Gem. We stopped by on our way to Times Sq. and we were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful food and coffee. The food was absolutely delicious and both of my daughters finished their meals with smiles. 

Freshly squeezed OJ - 
House made cream cheese - 

My only wish - open one up in Northern VA."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-03-16,5.0,"This cute cafe/tea shop is the perfect place to relax or get some work done. The interior is clean and nicely decorated. And even though from the outside it seems small, there is plenty of seating and even an outdoor patio in the back! 

I got a piece of banana bread and a green tea which both hit the spot. I love that they serve loose leaf teas which is pretty unique and reminds me of the comforts of home. They will even refill your tea with hotwater for free which works because its loose leaf tea, which can be brewed more than once. The banana bread was also not too sweet and the perfect heaviness to hold you over until your next meal.

Another plus is the amazing customer service. The lady who seems like the owner of the shop is very attentive and clearly explained the menu. There is also free wifi which is a plus for anyone who needs to get work done.

If I lived in the neighborhood this would easily become a go to spot."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2020-03-05,1.0,"This place is a SHAM...in a neighborhood full of overpriced spots, this is the absolute rip off of rip offs. Stay. Away. I wish there was an option to give negative stars. I've lived in this neighborhood for 4 years and I frequent lots of establishments....NEVER again."
969,ut47-new-york-3,2019-06-29,3.0,"Bubble tea here really isn't all that great. I ordered a taro milk tea with almond milk and no sugar, to which they said they don't add sugar, so I expected the drink not to be sweetened, or just very lightly. But the milk tea itself was sweet to my taste (I always order bubble tea with no sugar), and even though the taro flavor was nice, I didn't like how creamy the texture was. I was expecting a liquid texture, not a smoothie-like. The pearls themselves weren't good, either. They had no taste, as in they were unsweetened. I wouldn't have minded it because I myself can't handle sweet things very well, if not for the lackluster texture. It was chewy but still much harder than you usually get at other bubble tea chains like Gong Cha or ViVi. For a cup of bubble tea this quality, the price is definitely not worth it.

HOWEVER, they have interesting drink choices on their menu, and the space is very nice, too, ideal for working with free and fast wifi, so I think I'll come back at some point to try out other drinks on their menu."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2020-01-30,5.0,"Delicious smoothie bowl . I got the mango tango which was probably more watery than the açai bowl which I originally came for a juice so this was perfect!

I would probably try the açai berry bowl next. It's $8.95 and probably more filling.

If you don't have a big appetite the mango tango is a great breakfast or lunch. I'd eat this more as a yummy and healthy snack. 

Everything seems super fresh and it was DELICIOUS ! I also didn't wait long even though many people seem to come here.

Pro tip: if you are counting calories check my menu photos along with ingredients ."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2020-01-18,5.0,Midtown East doesn't have many bubble tea spots. I was happy to find this one! I know most of the food they sell is healthy items (will definitely try the açaí bowls  next time) but I was craving matcha so I came here. I was happy to know the matcha milk tea is non-dairy! The service here was fast! Excited to come back again.
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-03-28,3.0,"When u are in a rush or just don't feel
Like having anything too heavy a decent juice place like this can come in handy. 
First time I had the Tropicano smoothie very good nice fruit flavors. Next time I had the Classico this is strawberry & banana good smoothy nice taste as well.
Small location, service is quick for the most part assuming it's not packed mornings seems to be busier here. 
Good juices a bit pricey but not terrible assuming u are not having one every day."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2018-11-26,5.0,"This is such a cute and healthy spot! 

They are vegan friendly and the smoothies are fantastic. 

Every smoothie is customizable and you can add anything you want to your drink. 

They also sell fresh snacks and fruit. 

The menu is detailed and the service is quick! 

I recommend the smoothies, specifically the peanut butter one with strawberries and banana!! It's delicious!"
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-11-22,3.0,"It is another overpriced juice bar for me. I got a large watermelon juice and a large orange juice for $14 and change. The watermelon juice wasn't cold or have it's natural sweetness so it wasn't very refreshing. The orange juice fresh, a little sour."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2020-01-29,5.0,First timer alert!  Wasn't feeling very well and a friend suggested to get a juice with ginger. Juicy Cube was on the way to an appointment name to t so stopped in and purchased the detox juice and a shot of ginger. The ginger shot was made fresh and served in a shot glass...she said just take it to the head so I did!  It was a little spicy but nothing too bad. The detox has a nice little spice aftertaste from the ginger and the celery covers up the carrots. I would definitely go back because I want to try the watermelon lemonade refresher.
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-12-28,1.0,"I called ahead to make sure they made Acai bowls.  Yelp (AND THEIR POSTED HOURS) says it closes at 8:15.  I got there at 7:08 and everything was closed.  We walked a long time to get here, to see it closed an hour earlier than it's posted time.  Very disappointed."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2018-08-31,4.0,"I came by Juicy Cube to grab a quick drink. They have a variety of choices to choose from. 

I got myself the ""Hawaiian Breeze."" Most places are not as kind and willing so I was surprised that when I asked to replace the ""Coconut oil"" with ""Strawberry"" the cashier was willing and did not question why I wanted to switch.

Although the prices were a little bit on the pricier side for a 16oz smoothie ($8) in my opinion, the drinks themselves were made with real fruit so it was organically a healthy spot. The next time I stop by I will probably go for the Acai Bowl / Boba Tea. 

I'd recommend stopping by to grab yourself a quick drink when you are on the go or need a refreshing drink."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-08-18,5.0,"Amazing grab and go smoothie and fresh juice joint. Not too pricey, either. My personal faves are the turmeric ginger shot and the Hawaiin breeze smoothie, which you can get with no added sugar. It's a pineapple banana dream come true. They also offer bubble tea and acai bowls, if that's more your thing. This is one of the best fresh juice places I've ever seen, it's just too bad I don't have one near my home!"
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2018-07-22,2.0,"Bubble tea,  fresh fruit smoothies,  and some light snacks.  Also fresh coconut available in the cooler,  they can open it up and make a blended drink or give it to you straight up. The coconut was a hit with my friends, but I found my tea a bit on the weak side, too much from powder, especially for more than $6 for a 24 oz. bubble tea.

No tables,  but some seating to relax up front as they make your drink. Asian pop music playing."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-08-28,5.0,"We were walking around New York and wanted a cold and refreshing smoothie. There were SO many shops to choose from. This seemed like a great option though, the workers were warm and friendly. It smelled great and we were given some great advice regarding the options. I always lean towards the green smoothies and this one stuck out to me. I recommend this smoothie shop. I got an açaí bowl from here a different day on my trip, not pictured. And it was also phenomenal! I highly recommend this place if you're in the area"
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-07-05,3.0,"Based on the reviews I guess I should be getting an acai bowl here and not the smoothie!  My smoothie tasted too icy and lacked a real good, fresh fruit flavor.  Service was super friendly but price felt much too high for the quality."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-06-16,2.0,"Not much to say, except that Juicy Cube seems on par with the many, many juice or smoothie places around without something to make it stand out. Definitely more juice than boba place. Just didn't find anything to redeem the sky high prices."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-07-14,5.0,Great bubble tea spot in midtown. I come here often and typically get the matcha bubble tea which has the perfect amount of sweetness for a milk based tea. The bobas are always fresh and never chewy.
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-05-27,4.0,"Our Airbnb was pretty close to this spot so we chose to grab a healthier ""dessert"" here after dinner. Their acai bowls are very large and pretty reasonably priced (especially compared to what you can get in CA). I really loved the addition of peanut butter in the bowl to give it some extra creaminess. This was such a big bowl that we were able to save some for breakfast the next day in the fridge (texture stayed the same, bananas just oxidized a bit). I also grabbed one of their fresh pressed juices and it tasted very refreshing! This is was a good spot to get something healthy in the midst of all our sweet dessert and bagel treats."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2018-10-05,5.0,"Super cute place! Came here because I was craving for an açaí bowl and their açaí bowls are cheaper than most places. I got the Açaí Berry and it's only $8.25! I love the fact that you get to customize your own bowl. I added banana, strawberry,blueberry, and coconut flakes on top but that was an additional charge and the total came out to be around $11. The bowl was delicious and very instagram worthy! Would definitely come back for more."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2017-12-23,4.0,"Vegan boba? Sure I am in. 

Great boba and smoothie cafe for the health-conscious. They offer variety of plant based milks and exotic fruits. The smoothie and boba drinks we ordered were tasty. The boba pearls were soft and chewy. Perfect!"
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-09-17,5.0,"Came to NYC for a quick trip and I needed my morning smoothie fix. Great tasting smoothies, chia pudding & oatmeal! They only use fresh fruit & veggies, which is the way it should be! No sugary, concentrated juices. Highly recommend!"
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2020-01-04,5.0,I haven't stopped by for a couple months and to my surprise they've redecorated the place. I really like the new floor and the color of their ceiling. It's like an immersion of nature. ALSO I really have to say something about their Hot C drink. Its like medicine without the pills. I grabbed one because I was feeling sick. It really helped me fight away the cold. Thanks Juicy cube! I'll definitely come back again.
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-03-24,5.0,"Simple store front, easy menu and delicious protein plus acai bowl for an affordable price. The acai was a little more runny than how I usually like it but that varies from store to store. Overall a good experience"
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-08-08,2.0,Had the green juice; honestly not worth the price.  Especially since it tastes awful. Also they had to reboot their register and didn't once apologize for making me wait
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-04-25,5.0,Greenlicouse soooo Amazing...And the Açaí Bowl with peanut butter also yum! Healthy and delicious~I need smoothies every day ~

970,juicy-cube-new-york,2018-12-29,4.0,"I came by Juicy Cube after searching Yelp for a place to grab lunch. I was working a few blocks away, and I love bubble tea, so I was stoked to find Juicy Cube. I ordered a large strawberry black tea with boba. There were so many bobas! The portion was really generous, that I ended up wishing I had more tea. I also ordered the berry acai bowl. It came with oats, peanut butter, and bananas. The acai was more of a smoothie consistency. It's not what I'm used to, but nevertheless, the flavors were good and the bowl was filling. There isn't really a place to sit and enjoy your meal, however I was grabbing it to go, so it didn't really matter. The store itself is light and filled with fruit. If you're looking for a fresh juice or fruit smoothie this is definitely your place."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2017-11-16,5.0,"Fast, delicious, and convenient, Juicy Cube is located several blocks from the NRW 4,5,6. This small Asian-owned juice shop has a long list of juice and smoothies along with bubble tea and some healthy snacks. My personal favorite is their number one green juice which always hits the spot after a hard workout. Prices are typical based on location as the lowest price juice ranges from $6~. All drinks are served in bubble tea cups and sealed with a plastic seal. Juicy Cube also serves pure, fresh juice if you're not interested in greens and veggie mixes. 

Staff is always friendly and quick. No table seating but surrounding benches are available inside. Open until 9.

Accepts card and cash.
No bathrooms.

Don't forget to get a stamp card to receive a free drink!"

I'm recovering from a cold, lost my taste buds and am seeking ""clean, healthy"" sustenance since savory foods aren't doing it for me now. Boy am I glad I tried Juicy Cube. The store is clean and bright with bench seating. I've visited twice and the staff is sweet and helpful. My favorite item is the Acai Berry bowl since I love peanut butter. I think their acai bowls are reasonably priced and a good, filling portion. I just had the Hot C to help with my cold. I also tried the Figaro and Hawaiian Breeze smoothies, didn't care for the latter since it tasted mostly of bananas and I wanted mango. I love the variety they offer and will be back to try other items. I can see myself having their acai bowls as a healthy meal during the Summer."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2018-01-16,5.0,"I actually come here a lot for the bubble tea. They don't have the million of toppings other places have, but they've got the basics (bubbles, lychee, etc.) 
What I really like about this place is that you can combine your bubble tea with the juices they offer. I usually get mango green tea + orange juice. It's great."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2018-09-29,5.0,Just had the delicious açaí bowl for lunch and I'm hooked #acaifordays Really enjoy the flavor of açaí and fresh fruits with crunchy granola makes it the perfect and quick treat
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-07-12,3.0,"DISCLAIMER: the food is really good. The reason I'm leaving just three stars is lack of transparency about allergens. I used to have a life-threatening peanut allergy, as many people do, and had I not outgrown the allergy, their smoothie bowls might have killed me. They put oatmeal on their smoothie bowls, but don't specify on the menu that they actually put peanut butter in the oatmeal. If you have a severe allergy, you know to ask the server or cashier about possible allergens in the food before ordering. 

I didn't do this, since I don't have a food allergy anymore, but after tasting peanut butter in the oatmeal, I told the cashier exactly what I'm writing in this review: indicate on the menu that your oatmeal has peanut butter! He denied that it had peanut butter even though I knew it did from the taste. After a few minutes of my trying to convince him he asked his coworker if the oatmeal had peanut butter--it did! 

Don't come here if you have severe food allergies. For all people without allergies, this place is great! Seriously, Juicy Cube, you need to be more helpful to people with allergies. The onus often is on the consumer where it really doesn't need to be--just list common allergens that are in your food on the menu!"
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-04-23,5.0,"Very cute shop that had a wide selection of smoothies that were made fresh to order. I was there for the bubble tea. I got a 16 oz taro (the purple one treat tastes like milk after eating a bowl of Lucky Charms, in my opinion) with bubbles (tapioca). The drink was served up very quickly and the price was reasonable considering it was in New York City.  The only criticism I had, which is kind of a sad one to make, is that the amount of bubbles was maybe a bit too much. I think I could have handled about half the amount and I would have been satisfied. However, the tarp itself, the flavor, the service, the location, and the price was perfectly acceptable."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-04-01,4.0,Cute juice joint. I went with the Kale smoothie (forget the name) and you can actually taste the kale among the other ingredients. Very fast service. Lots of organic fruits and mills to choose from.

The açaí bowl I received was filled with little pieces of plastic. I didn't realize i was eating plastic until half way through the bowl. Everyone beware of this place! I posted a picture of the bowl with the plastic if you want to see it. The only reason I didn't go back and get a refund was because I was already at work. I will never eat here again. Beware if you eat here, check for plastic."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2016-05-12,5.0,"My favorite tea is Taro sow milk tea with the Popping Boba, Instead of regular pearls the popping boba is a thin wall grapefruit or mango juice filled pearl. I don't know who else has this CoCo Fresh doesn't. that's for sure.

You suck up the popping boba pearls with your straw and pop them in your mouth, it's like heaven in your mouth coming from a cup.  You should hear me making that sucking slurp slurp slurping sound when I get to the bottom and the last of boba is under some ice cubes,. Its so embarrassing! so I just rip open the top drink it down like a shot of whisky. YUM"
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2018-05-10,1.0,"I want to preface this by saying I don't enjoy giving such a shitty review, but I think the circumstances warrant it. 

Steps to get a horrible review:

1. Take my order--large bubble tea, almond milk. Already pretty pricey, but I'm willing to give it a shot. 

2. Screw up the order by giving me a small, even though I already paid extra for the large. Fine, people make mistakes. 

3. Take a bunch of time arguing about who screwed it up, rather than just fixing your mistake. 

4. Finally remake my drink, but give me regular fucking cow's milk, which I am allergic to, and only realized after I drank 1/3 of it. No label on the new cup, no one asking to make sure it was right. Even though they had the original drink label made with almond milk. 

This is a nice little shop with good menu options, but a place that can't even manage to keep an allergen out of my food when I already called it out might be on my permanent block list."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2017-05-03,3.0,"Juicy Cube is a breath of fresh air in the midtown food scene--bubble tea, acai bowls under $10, and vegan snacks/food! I was excited to swing by to grab an acai bowl for breakfast/lunch but wasn't too impressed by it.

***LOCATION & INTERIOR**
Juicy Cube by the corner of 56th & Lex, right next to the newly opened KBBQ by Korilla (yesss, more casual Asian eats please). The inside is relatively spacious given the area, with a small area to sit against one wall. The right wall is taken up by three fridges stocked with vegan Asian food (noodles, dumplings, etc.), wheatgrass and ginger shots ($2.75 each but they're supposed to be great for you??), chia pudding, oatmeal, and young coconuts. The counters are equally packed with goods, ranging from snacks to energy/protein bars, tea, and dried fruit and nuts. I'm impressed with their collection of healthy products.

It was really crowded when I stopped by at peak weekday lunch hour, but there were a lot of workers behind the counter speedily blending away.

***FOOD***
I ordered the berry acai bowl, no peanut butter mixed in for ~$8 after tax. Really reasonable price considering that 1) it's an acai bowl and 2) it's midtown. My order was ready in under 10min.

My first thought was oh this bowl is smaller than expected, but it was heavy (i.e., filled most of the way with the acai mix) and ended up being pretty filling. On top was crunchy granola, which I really liked, and a spoonful of smooth peanut butter. The acai mix was slightly sweet and fruity, but wasn't that flavorful...worse, it was lukewarm! Instead of being cold and refreshing like a normal smoothie bowl, it was literally room temperature. I finished the whole thing, but only because I added some of my own chilled strawberries to mix in with the granola.

Maybe I just came at a bad time since they were speeding through orders?

***NOTES/RECOMMENDATION***
Juicy Cube has so much potential because they just have so much...stuff. Food, drinks, snacks, they have it all. Although my order was disappointing this time, I'll still go back since it's acai bowls are the cheapest near my office and have potential to be good...better luck next time?"
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2017-03-05,5.0,"Seems like I come here at least twice a week. Guess if you're in the check-in dukedom, you gotta write a review.

It's hands on the most consistently delicious smoothie and juice place in New York, made with fresh and healthy ingredients. My new favorite is the Green Queen. It kicks my dessert cravings to the curb and gives me some of the greens I need for the day. I'd highly recommend!

(I have tried their vegan foods too. Not a big fan...but hey if you're on the go and need something super healthy, maybe you'd like it...though I'd suggest sticking to their liquids section)"
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2018-09-29,5.0,"The bubble tea are good, it have lot different flavors, and my favorite one is taro,  which came with a beautiful purple color, and tasty."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2019-03-26,5.0,"I've had so many acai bowls but none compare to Juicy Cube's Rio Blend!! It is simply amazing. It's very filling so at times I'll have this for lunch and I won't be hungry until late evening.

My only complaint is that I wish there was one closer to my job (times square) so that I could go once a week!"
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2018-07-19,1.0,"This review is just for the bubble tea: If you're thinking about coming here to get the bubble milk tea just because there are literally no boba places in midtown and you're just really craving it--DON'T.

They use powdered tea that doesn't even taste like tea it's so pale and bland, the boba is also tasteless and just a little bit mushy...oh and all of this will cost you over $5 for a regular. The markup would be one thing if it hit the spot at all (hey, I get it, it's midtown, everything is overpriced). But for a bland cup of watery powder with mushy pearls? Save your money."
970,juicy-cube-new-york,2018-08-02,3.0,With tax $4.90 for a 16oz bubble milk tea. I expected authentic real milk tea not powder + sugar. It's also towards the sweeter side for my taste. Service was prompt.
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2020-03-31,5.0,Good place in midtown on Madison Avenue and 40th Street to grab coffee or a fresh smoothie.  The food here that I've tried has also been very good.  Service is fast and friendly.  Overall a great spot if you work in the area.
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2020-03-21,4.0,Really amazing latte here. There are a few working spaces of chairs and sofas and outlets to plug in! The food options looked really tasty and it's awesome that they also have a grab and go area! Tons of people coming in for food and beverages. Can't wait to come back and meet people who work from home and like a work space in public!

Taste - 0 , 2 stars is for ambience

Would never come back"
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-07-26,3.0,"Just picked up an avocado sandwich from Dr. Smood. Here are my thoughts:

Staff: Amazingly friendly. Cashier was obviously really excited about the Dr. Smood concept and chatted with me about it for a long time!

Ambiance: Cute place but I didn't get to eat there today as I took my sandwich to go.

Food: Just okay. Avocado sandwich is just bread, salt, and avocado. I had to add some salt and tomato to make it less bland. Prices are high and quantity is small. 

Overall: I do like that Dr. Smood is healthy and organic but unfortunately the pricing doesn't make sense here. Not sure I'll return."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-04-09,5.0,Definitely a great coffee place in midtown Manhattan right on Madison ave. Some things on the menu are very high but others such as coffee are priced just like Starbucks etc. Came here for the free coffee when you check in and wasn't disappointed! They actually gave me espresso over ice and almond milk which tastes very good despite the weird combination. Great place for a quick sit down or hangout. Very modern architecture inside and extremely clean. They also have other promotions going on. Recommended.
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-03-22,5.0,"Veggie patty sandwich all the way! I'll always shell out a little extra for some good organic vegan food and this sandwich hit the mark. Filling, tasty, fresh, highly recommend with one of their cashew mylk lattes. Love it!"
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-05-10,3.0,"I may have just picked out the wrong drink. I got the true green pressed juice with MCT oil. It has cucumber, celery, lemon, chard, parsley, dandelion, Cilantro, and MCT oil. Tasted too healthy for me to handle but was hoping they would add a sweet fruit to make it easier to drink."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-03-13,1.0,"Full of disappointment! 1. I asked for toasted bread it was as old as ice. 
2. Taste wise bad combination and sloppy work . A mishmash slammed on a flat bread. For $14 sandwich I expect better quality of food
3. They don't stand to what they claim"
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-07-30,5.0,This is probably my favorite spot I ever ate at. That tropical avocado toast and Hawj shake was awesome. The customer services was great staff was very polite and friendly. I'm definitely will be returning back.
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-06-04,4.0,"Here's my TLDR review, for the efficient, busy, and fast-acting lunchers out there: 

Smood is a health and wellness cafe with prepared sandwiches, soups, and breakfast items, as well as a full wall of grab-and-go cases with food, juices, smoothies, and desserts.  The whole menu is non dairy, non gmo, and is free of refined sugar.  Smood also makes its own low glycemic bread in-house from spelt flour.  The wild caught salmon sandwich is my personal favorite, and a classic combination (smoked salmon, avo, tomato, vegan cream cheese), and pairs so well with the house made bread, which is perfectly crunchy on the outside and warm, soft, and doughy on the inside.  The house made and dairy free pesto is also really good. It comes on the tuna sandwich, but if you ask nicely they will put it on the salmon sandwich, and then you can eat your lunch and waltz out of there on cloud 9!  The space is conducive to both work and socialization, and the staff are helpful and passionate about Smood.  It's pricey, but if you are on a forever hunt through the city for a health food lunch spot that actually has a respect for the integrity of the ingredients in each menu item, this place is worth it.  

Here are some more deets, if you have a little more time and attention span:  

The Shtick: Super healthy, all ingredients certified organic, dine-in or take-out lunch spot with smoothies, coffee, tea, and matcha too!  

The Product: I've been here a ton, and everything I've gotten is delicious.  It's not exactly low calorie, but everything is scratch-made, including the granolas and desserts, and they even make their low glycemic bread in-house from spelt flour.  I am pretty sensitive to carbs, especially in the afternoon with lunch because my energy tends to spike and then crash mid-afternoon, and this bread (which is perfectly crunchy on the outside but soft and doughy on the inside and is served warm with your sandwich) really keeps me full and energized for hours.  There are also a number of vegan options on the menu if that's your thing, and everything you can purchase is non dairy, non gmo, and free of refined sugar.  My personal favorite is the wild caught salmon sandwich (made with smoked salmon, avocado, tomato, vegan cream cheese, S&P), and my second favorite is the Power Tuna (tuna, vegan mayo, avo, tomato, pesto, S&P).  The Power Tuna is basically a tuna salad sandwich, but the vegan mayo is creamy and tasty, an the pesto is salty and fragrant and really elevates this sandwich.  The soups are no frills and not too salty, but are still really good (added bonus if you dip the house made bread!)  

The Space: It's a cool space with plenty of seating both downstairs and upstairs.  There is wifi and there are outlets so you can hang on your laptop for a bit.  It's also a great space to come with co-workers for a lunch or coffee break because it isn't hushed like a library.  

The Staff: The staff here is excellent.  Above and beyond!  Ask them anything about the menu and they will respond passionately and informatively.    

Price/Value: This depends.  If you really value organic ingredients, then you should come here and have a total field day.  Personally, the items here are a bit too expensive to make it a regular rotation in my meal plan, however when I am feeling like a splurge, this is one of my go-to spots!"
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-07-24,2.0,"This place was underwhelming. Every single thing on the menu was overpriced and came in small portions. I ordered the tuna sandwich and it had approximately 0 flavor. The people working behind the counter seemed stressed and had to keep asking people to correct and clarify their orders while they were making them, only creating more chaos. I was still starving after my $15 tuna sandwich, so I looked at the smoothie and shake menu but didn't want to spend another $10 on something that probably would've been very small in size. I will not be returning."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-11-25,4.0,"I come here sometimes to grab their vegan sandwich to go. It's literally just a bunch of dips/spreads with some spinach on bread but sooooo good. A little pricey overall, but what 'trendy' cafe in the city isn't?"
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-10-07,5.0,"I love Dr Smood.  Thank YOU for bringing healthy options to NYC.   the food is delicious, fresh and guilt free, the ambiance is excellent for dining with a friend, colleague or alone.   You can get a tasty meal and know you are doing your body a favor.  The staff is kind and generous and will allow you to test something if you aren't sure if you will like it.
I highly recommend Dr Smood and wish they would open a location on the Upper West Side.
Mush better than Joe and the Juice!

The manager at the Madison location is lovely too and very knowledgeable.   

We all need more Smood!!"
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-10-30,2.0,"Back when I was younger and started going to college in the city, Evas (on 8th St) used to be the ""healthy"" place to eat.  And I was there several times a week.  Fresh squeezed OJ (oranges from FL), homemade spanakopita (spinach from CA), homemade pickled carrots, etc.  Now, the younger generation wants avocados from Mexico on toast with grain from Africa (flecked with gold from Russia).

None of that has to do with Dr Smood, however.  What stands out in my mind about this place:

1)  Very expensive.
2)  7 kinds of avocado toast!
3)  Not very much interesting to eat.
4)  Poorly organized layout.  Thank goodness they don't get many customers or it would be chaos!
5)  Extra expensive.
6)  Millennials sitting around the tables using the WiFi without having purchased any food.
7)  Black decor.
8)  Did I mention expensive?"
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-04-01,2.0,"Unimpressed by the pricing.  

I came in before lunch rush and they ran out of to go bags.  I had to carry back multiple items in my hand.  I almost dropped one of 4 purchases on the street. 

As for the food - the soup definitely needs more flavor."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-03-16,1.0,"The ultimate scam. I came here for breakfast and ordered an avocado toast. Boy, was I disappointed when I got to the office. It was the blandest, most stale and basic avocado toast I'd ever consumed. Complete waste of $. I make better avo toast at home. Never again.

2ND UPDATED REVIEW 3/16/19:
First, unless the wrong email address was provided, my email was sent to the right address. Second, I was accused of making threats, spewing vitriol, negativity, and trying to harm Dr Smood. That's where I draw the line. Marah invited me to give her a call via private message but, I don't feel comfortable speaking with anyone who is accusing me of making a ""threat"" through an honest Yelp review. My reviews are based in personal experience and facts. Businesses lose $75 billion due to poor customer service, a year. Ask Forbes. It's not vitriol, negativity or intended to harm. Holding a business accountable is not a ""threat"". As a business, you want your customers to hold you accountable. The responses to negative customer feedback on Dr Smoods Yelp account are extremely passive-aggressive. As someone in the customer service industry, I advise Dr Smood to rethink the way hospitality and customer experience responds to the folks driving their busine$$. There's a continuous deflection of blame on Dr Smoods part that somehow turns back onto the customer. Simply put, I will never patronize Dr Smood again. 

UPDATED REVIEW 3/16/19: After reading the response to my review from Marah at Dr Smood, I drafted an email to send her. Before I could hit send, I decided to give Dr Smood another chance. Maybe I was too harsh on them. 

BIG MISTAKE!

On March 14, I went in during my lunch hour for a quick bite. I ordered an avocado toast with SALMON to go, this time. I explained to the gentleman that I had ordered an avo toast earlier in the week and it wasn't good or aesthetically pleasing, at all. He specified to the person preparing my order to make the toast ""pretty"".

I was really looking forward to getting back to my office to have a hearty lunch. I open my order and there's no salmon in my toast. Am I missing something? There is supposed to be salmon on my toast. I paid $13.01 for it. This is absolutely inexcusable for a company with Dr Smoods vision, approach and price point.

I've had avocado toast in every borough. Both to go and dine-in. I've never had a gripe about any avo toast order, ever. I'll add that the presentation of all my to-go orders has mirrored what I would have received, had I dined in.

As a businesswoman with a packed schedule, I have very little time to return to establishments to voice my displeasure with something I have purchased. When you're paying $13 for a food item, you expect for it to be edible and slightly appealing to look at. You expect not to have to go back to a place to complain. For $13, it better be dang good.

Marah suggested I email her if I wanted to discuss further, and I did. Per Marah, she wished I would have brought my gripe to her attention directly. I have yet to hear anything from her. 

Before my two visits to Dr Smood, I had never stepped foot in any of their locations. This is a terrible introduction to their chain. I'm really looking forward to hearing what she has to say about the TWO negative experiences I had within ONE week.

I encourage everyone, if you have a bad experience at Dr Smood or anywhere else, voice your displeasure. Write that Yelp review. Take it to Twitter and IG. These businesses need to be held accountable. Word of mouth is powerful and consumers trust online reviews. You might think you're one bad experience and it won't make a difference but it will cost them. If they're a business that actually cares about their customer, they will try to rectify the issue."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-01-15,5.0,"It's true - this place IS expensive but I'm not as bothered to pay a little more when I know I'm getting clean, high quality food. I've never gotten regular coffee here, but the latte is pretty good (get it with Cashew milk to add a little bit of natural sweetness). 

Service is good, but was even more exceptional this morning when Tisha (sorry if I butchered the name) educated me about their rewards program (for every 10 beverages you purchase, you get 1 free AND for every 20 stars you accumulate, you get a free item .. ANY item ... in the store!) and suggested the cashew milk with my latte. I'm a sucker for info, especially when someone goes out of their way to educate me. 

Come here expecting to pay a little extra, but know that what you're getting is healthy, unprocessed, organic AND delicious food."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2017-07-05,4.0,"Expensive healthy organic and raw. Come here for the first time, this place is good for coffee/juices/snacks/sandwiches. The cracker /snack/ are all raw and organic and run around ~$7-8. But as long as I see the ingredients, I'm sold. I got the spirulina green bagel with vegan cream cheese. It's small, two pieces but it's made of all the superfoods such as spirulina, coconut oil, almond meal, flax seeds.....the list goes on. I can't see any ""normal/bad ingredients"". So points for that. The taste is good and dense, and very fulfilling.

There are not so many choices of shakes though. A lot of pressed juices choice. Next time I'll probably get coffee and sandwich."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-11-27,4.0,The prices are insanely expensive here but the food quality seems to be great. I've only gotten the salmon sandwich on their special bread with their house hot sauce and it was soooo so good. Excited to try other things here.
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-06-24,4.0,"Very healthy food, especially salmon and avocado sandwich, my favorite, and pole caught tuna sandwich. Great selection of fresh made juices, for different health goals: detox, energizing, slimmer, and you name it. Tables on two levels here (unlike at 485 Lexington) and I do prefer the privacy at the second floor. All in all very good place but a little pricey, considering that you eat just sandwiches or salads and with the juice you easily pay 20 $ or more. Nevertheless, one of the best new chains for Healthy food."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-03-19,1.0,"What a time to be alive!

I'm still confused but somehow the manager of this location was able to successfully justify serving me gravel in my salad at lunch today. I generally like the food at Dr. Smood and have told my entire office that their oatmeal is the real deal. Unfortunately I have to do my duty to the yelp community and warn you that their salads are soooo organic, you could very well be served ""some dirt and agricultural materials"" in your bowl of greens!"
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-05-02,4.0,"I had never been to a Dr Smood before but came with friends after taking a hot yoga class. Yes, so very basic of us. This location is very very nice. Doesn't look like a smoothie place in anyway. It's like a fancy coffee shop taken to an extreme that had an upstairs. You can order from the bar or take the pre-made juices from the fridge. I was actually pretty surprised at their limited selection of smoothies made fresh at the bar. They had three along with three shakes. The three shakes are essentially chocolate, chai (I think), and vanilla and basically like a dessert, so I went for the Smoods to get something more refreshing and healthy. I ended up getting the Health Smood, which is a strawberry banana smoothie. Essentially $10 with tax. Which is outrageous. It was a decent portion, but this would never be a regular thing for me. Nevertheless, the smoothie was very very tasty and fresh. I enjoyed it especially after my workout. It was also made with almond milk, so dairy-free which is great since I'm lactose intolerant. No added sugars of course. My friend got the green fresh Smood, I think called Strong? It was super unsweet and not good in my opinion. I'm sure the pre-made ones in the fridge are also tasty, but they are the same price as the freshly made Smoods, so that's why I opted for those. In the fridge, they also have some healthy food options like a quinoa bowl but didn't look appealing to me, so I opted not to try. 

This place will deliver what you're expecting as long as you know you're getting a very expensive smoothie in a posh atmosphere. This would be an every once in a while, kind of treat place for me."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-05-22,2.0,"Soup is gross and not edible, female manager needs a lesson in customer service, major attitude issue for no reason, 2 stars for decent (yet overpriced) avocado toast (that you can really get anywhere).. Poorly managed overall, first and last time trying this place."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-05-29,2.0,Crazy overpriced. Avocado toast is literally just sliced avocado on white bread. Coffee is meh. The atmosphere is chill and that's really all it's got going for it.
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-01-24,5.0,"Really awesome place to come grab a quick coffee and breakfast! They have cashew, almond and coconut milk to put in their coffee. I highly recommend the cashew milk iced latte! The oatmeal is also deliciously hearty with almond butter, nuts and dried fruits.

The atmosphere has a cool, modern feel to it with high ceilings and plenty  of room to sit in the back or upstairs. Will definitely return to get a coffee and sit there to get some work done!"
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-10-27,4.0,"Quiet, clean and delicious food. The power tuna sandwich is perfection. Coffee is solid. Internet, so you can work quietly and NO ONE bothers you at all."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2017-09-19,4.0,"This is a really cool place to come and have lunch. They have a lot of healthy options: high quality sandwiches, salads, juices and power snacks. And numerous vegan options. My favourite sandwich is the veggie pattie (which is vegan). Something about the magical combination of condiments makes it super tasty. 

The staff here are pretty fast and friendly, and in a jovial and energetic mood. They smile and bid you hello and farewell - which is becoming less common in fast food customer service these days. I usually order through the Ritual app rather than at the counter. They have offered to give me intel on the superfoods they sell but I declined and they were not pushy.

Even though I order through an app I usually eat here. It is a sizeable, two-level space with very high ceilings. Black and very modern decor with comfy furniture, funky music and good WiFi. I prefer to sit upstairs to get away from it all - a very relaxing place to hang out and a good vibe. A respite from the office that feels miles away from the chaos of midtown and ensues right outside."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-11-15,4.0,"Such a lux place to have just salads, sandwiches and coffee. The music is reminiscent of Miami (at least today) and the staff is friendly. The decor is amazing. I got the Health Salad (Cashew Kale) and it was surprisingly good for how healthy it sounded. The ingredients were a great mixture and not one over powered. This is a great spot for business meetings."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-09-17,2.0,"While I like the concept, my experience here has only been negative. There can be 2 customers, 5 people behind the counter and it will still take 20 min to get your order. Today was the last straw for me when I witnessed one person's order get ""lost"" after which my order was given to someone else (after I had already waited 20 minutes for it). I could not afford to wait another 20 minutes for 3 people to prepare my sandwich. For a midtown location with endless quick lunch options, I don't know how this place survives. The concept is great, a healthy food choice with great ingredients, but the efficiency of service is nonexistent. It explains why this place is always empty. Sadly I will not be returning."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-01-18,1.0,"So my first experience Dr. Smood was their Soho location, which was pleasant enough. Not bad for a light snack...the only drawback...the price.
Personally, I'm getting tired of all of these ""healthy"" food option spots, juice shops, and everything else that is vegan/hip. It's just an excuse to jack up prices.
So my first experience, and maybe last at the Madison Avenue location off of 42nd Street, was kinda weird. First, I'm standing at the register watching the girl at the register continue a conversation with what I'm assuming was a customer, and obviously long after the sale was finalized. The second girl comes to the second register and just kinda blankly stares in my direction while I'm actually holding a drink in my hand. And then when the lights switch on, she asks me if I need help.
Then I proceed an asking about the eggplant jerky sandwich...well order it...and she tells me, ""I'm sorry, we are out of tomatoes, just so you know. So, I'm forsaking a pretty major player in any sandwich. And looking at the other options on the menu, they all have tomatoes in them! My befuddled looks didn't really hit home with anyone. No alternatives to add, maybe ""hey, we can throw on avocado"", anything. But, nope. Didn't happen. 
What is the only inherent problem is, is that if I'm shelling out nearly $12 for a pretty basic sandwich, I expect the ingredients that go into making a signature sandwich to all be there. Albeit, I was there slightly after the lunch rush (1:30pm), but tomatoes? Come on, really? But, then again the time shouldn't make a difference, or an excuse for running out a major ingredient for ANY sandwich on the planet.
Oh, the other problem...the drink I got one of the Organic Live Smoothies, the Green Protein. Begrudgingly I ordered the smoothie, since a sandwich was really not an option. Anyhoo...grabbed the smoothie, went back to work, opened it...and lo and behold, the smoothie was was completely sour! I was, for lack of a better word, pissed. At this point I had to get back to work, so I just put the bottle in the fridge thinking that I would go kick up a storm the next day...I wound up never going...period. Definitely will not be paying a return trip. I'll take my business to Juice Press...never had issues there."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-04-04,5.0,I have literally never had a bad experience here. The food is great and the people always have a smile on their face. Can't recommend it enough if you're looking for a quick but quality bite to eat!
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2017-03-30,5.0,"Dr Smood is a cool vegan place debuted in NY weeks ahead from its origin Miami. Instead of using dairy, Dr Smood has been heavily relying on coconut or cashew milk as substitutes, and at the same time, carrying a long list of healthy vegan savory options. 

While they do have regular espresso drinks, I would recommend getting the house specialty drinks - Hawaj white coffee, golden latte, or matcha latte. Gave a try on their white coffee and willingly added coconut milk - hmm good one!

Their inside decoration (featuring mostly black and red) carried a real cool vibe!"
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-02-08,5.0,Really healthy food and amazing staff. They're so kind and helpful even if you don't know much about what you're ordering!

Lots of new coffee shops opening around Grand Central Station, which is perfect as I work nearby. Loved the ambiance the moment I walked in. The staff was super friendly as well. The lady holding the iPad near the coolers could be quite pushy but still helpful if you have questions about their items. 

I tried their Matcha Latte and Golden Latte on two separate occasions. I really liked the taste of both of them and the texture was really smooth! For someone who drinks coffee a lot, I feel healthy getting coffee from here because they use coconut milk and cashew milk, except I'd need a bottomless bank account to be able to come here everyday! I'll definitely be back to try their juices!"

I got a really filling Cacao shake which doesn't have any dairy and packed with dates, Brazil nut & cinnamon. They also have wide variety of sandwiches and I believe everything is organic here, so be ready to shell out $15. Will be back again to try other healthy concoctions.

To note: They give you free coffee (pick any from the non-specialties range) with any purchase made. I discovered this recently and was delighted because they use a blend of cashew & almond making my free cappuccino absolutely delicious."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-06-15,4.0,"Definitely loving what Dr. SMOOD has to offer, I only wish the staff was as delightful as the product and concept. 

My darling friend works on Madison & I just started working on 5th, so this spot is about to be my regular go-to!

However, I'm really hoping they bring in more positive staff because the vibe is very rude. 

Not sure if they just deal with jerks all day but the staff is very aloof. Will not aid direction for the line, fails to greet guests while entering/exiting... They will maintain personal convos but will not acknowledge or engage guests...At least the settings were clean and utensils were abundant!

CARD ONLY! That was actually the ONLY thing the cashier said ""We only take CARD."" I'm super bubbly so I'm used to people being annoyed at my energy but the cashier was not only annoyed, but infectious of a LACK of enthusiasm or energy as well.

I wish her better days and a smile, especially when I visit again! 

Tabouli Salad has me coming back! Loving the Rose Petal beauty water and the Banana, Coconut, Pineapple, Chia juice (not sure of the exact name, it's available pre-made in fridge)

Excited to invest my consumer power into this healthy, feel good company but until the staff starts to smile, this place gets 4 stars! [If the product wasn't THAAAAT good, I would never return, due to staff morale. Try it out and keep a thick skin in line/paying :)"
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-01-25,5.0,The Avocado Ginger smoody (correct spelling) is outstanding. Superfoods aplenty. I'm thinking this is going to be my daily lunch. Remarkably healthy and tastes good too.
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-03-21,1.0,"One of the worst things I have ever tasted.   I ordered online and it took over an hour.   I have been a healthy eater ....vegan for 7 yrs and vegetarian most of my life so I have had very kind of ""protein patty"" under the sun.  The flavors in the sandwich I got did not go together at all and overall it left a bizarre taste in your mouth.   I ordered vegan cream cheese on the side and did not receive it.  Since it took over an hour it was a cold soggy mess.   The taste of what I believe must have been the vegan mayo was this fermented fruity flavor. .....   not good.   I have heard great things about their in house nutmilks.  So perhaps it is a great place for lattes or coffee."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-03-19,5.0,"Surprised by the amount of negativity associated with Dr. Smood, I've been coming here for a while and have had nothing but pleasant experiences. The food is good, the atmosphere is nice, relaxing. The prices are high, that's my only complaint. It's quality, organic, food so I can understand why it's priced that way, but it was a turn off to me originally. However, their loyalty program makes up for this quite a bit and can ultimately save you over 10% over the course of your visits by offering you any free item after 20 points. I'm a pretty harsh critic (see some of my other restaurant reviews) but my experience here has been nothing but pleasant."
971,dr-smood-madison-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-02-02,1.0,"Which cafe is the worst? The one with bad food? The one with slow service? No... the one where you cannot buy anything. I loved dr Smood healthy deserts but never paid attention that I MUST pay with credit card. Last time I had only cash on me and it turned out that I cannot buy anything.

I respect the idea of saving nature but not when it turns a nightmare for the clients. A guy told me that they ""even have a sign"" that it's cash free zone ‍ Wonderful excuse! So I came with desire to make a purchase and With money but... they didn't sell anything to me. I felt horrible, surprised. I even had nothing to say and just 
went to Fresh across the street, they also have chia seed pudding. Maybe it's not so fancy, but at least they sell it! Instead showing signs and saying ""sorry but you can't buy anything here because you don't have a credit card"". ‍ It's good that they don't ask for crypto currency, so some people still can buy where."

I never knew how to pronounce this place but nonetheless I still find myself stopping in for Chai Tea Lattes, sweets and vegan sandwiches and salads. This gem is located across from my headquarters office, so I visit about twice a month or less. Today, I needed fresh cookies for my Secret Santa bag and I was in luck because Pret sells a large selection of fresh baked cookies for $1.99. Across the street, they're $3.50 per cookie. I purchased brownie, carrot cake and chocolate chip. 

I really love how well stocked and staffed this place is. The seating is ample and the place is very clean. The staff are sweethearts and I am IN LOVE with their chic bags and packaging. They've won my heart with that. 

The items are priced accordingly for the gourmet quality you receive. They also donate leftovers at night to the homeless. They also tugs on my heart strings."

There was a line for waiting checkout while the staff just kept talking to one customer even though she knew there was 3 people were waiting.  Another staff was even worse, she rather cleaning stuff like wiping the coffee machine instead of doing anything to help this situation. She helped the white dude in front of me to checkout and that's it. She glanced me several times and gave a face ""I don't give a dang"" yup, maybe Asian doesn't deserved to buy things here.

972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2018-01-17,4.0,Love Pret's philosophy but lattes and regular coffee were disappointing. The macchiatos are a little better. Their fresh and hot foods are the absolute best. Recommend the prosciutto sub and hearty oatmeal. Handy for when you're on the go and just want to pick up something fast. Seating can be a bit cramped.

You can truly tell this is true because, one the place is always so packed, and  two the quality of the food is always so fresh! I work very close by and whenever I want something quick for lunch I come here. There are so many healthy options to choose from, depending on how im feeling I get the Moroccan lentil soup, salmon power lunch bowl, chia seed pudding, overnight oats, and the list goes on and on.  The prices are also good for what they offer, I seriously think you cant beat a place like this when it comes to quick, freshness, and quality.

The staff here is also VERY nice and friendly! I weigh my review a lot on how the staff treats its customers. They do a great job, always very helpful! 

I love coming here!"

However. [excuse me as I grab my old lady cane]

WHY IS THIS PLACE SO LOUD!?!??!

Between the blasting music, approximately 75 employees all yelling at each other and customers (but with a smile on their face!  It's not aggressive, it's just LOUD) and sometimes everyone literally just starts screaming when they get a tip, which has convinced me never to give a tip - not that I'm ever particularly inclined to do so because by the time I get to the register I am ready to RUN OUT THE DOOR into the comparatively calm, serene environment of Lexington and 41st.  

Please turn down your music.  It's a tiny little store, usually packed and hectic - why add blasting music to make it even more uncomfortable?"
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2013-04-17,3.0,"Dropped in here the other day for lunch while out seeing a client close to Grand Central Station. This location is basically across the street from it and definitely gets busy that time of day. It's also a pretty tiny Pret with a small seating area to the side when you walk in.

As with all in this chain they offer a diverse selection of freshly made sandwiches, salads, and wraps. Hearty and tasty soup selections. Good quality ingredients, fresh and tasty. Portion sizes are just right so I didn't feel like a total slug when I finished lunch and headed back to the office. 

What's cool about this place is that everything is made fresh daily with organic and natural products. No additives or extra preservatives, which can cause all types of problems to our bodies. They use local suppliers for their products. At the end of the day they donate leftover food to City Harvest which is a wonderful charity. 

Very clean and bright as they all seem to be. Friendly staff and counter people too. A bit overpriced but they do offer wifi here. One of the better options if looking for a healthier bite to eat."
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2018-06-04,5.0,Pret is great! Their app is generous and frequently sends me passes for free drinks  the food is also consistently delicious. Friendly staff too.
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2014-12-18,4.0,"Good stuff, fresh and the happiest/friendliest working guy here helped me out... Plus they give their leftover food to charity every night.. 5 stars for that (and Mr. Friendly!)"

I watched him for 5 minutes taking care of customers with only positivity and professionalism! He recognized the locals, he encouraged the tourists to stay warm and happy and he did his job three times than other co-workers while also chnaging the trash.  This guy deserves a serious raise and title! If I was a local; I would return just for his excellent service... Very rare to find an exceptional employee these days..!!! Take good care of him! The 5 stars are for him."
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2017-01-27,4.0,"Pret is a great alternative to unhealthy fast food such as Mcdonald's. They use organic and lot of products and they are freshly made each day. They have pretty good coffee and everything from salad, hot food, to pastries. I love the coconut yogurt here. They have 2 kinds the blueberry and plain. Both are amazing but if you get plain put honey on it. The best part is that it is gluten and dairy free."
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2012-06-17,4.0,"With my continued protest against the horrible food and coffee at Starbucks, I end up coming to Pret before work, and even sometimes for lunch. Pret is from the UK, but that doesn't mean we NYers can't enjoy it. With their coffee, it's all organic coffee which is always a plus. The drip coffee is brewed pretty constantly, so you won't have some nasty coffee. If drip is your favorite, then their cappuccino isn't half bad either. With your coffee you have to get something to eat right? My absolute favorites are the croissant and the chocolate croissant. The croissants are freshly made, and still have that awesome crisp to it. I like my croissants, and Pret does them right.

Let's say you come here for some lunch. What to get? Well for starters they have a bunch of sandwiches to choose from. If you're like me and want to have a little bit of everything, then you're in for a treat. Pret lets you mix and match sandwiches for a little bit of a premium. On top of that, they do have some salads that you can snag up too. What's the best part of getting lunch here? Their sodas. Pret has 3 different kinds of soda, but my absolute favorite is the Grape Herb Soda. This thing is amazing, and I have to get it every single time.

As far as this place itself, it's pretty small and does get crowded in the morning. Free Wi-Fi here, and there's some seating to the right of shop. I love Pret, and having this one right next to work is even better. Quick place to stop off for breakfast, and a quicker place for lunch. Get it. Got it? Good!"

972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2017-07-24,1.0,Decided to give this place another try this morning.  I went in around 11:45AM to grab a bagel and coffee.  The customer service SUCKS!!! Some of the rudest people I've met works at this place.
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2018-02-07,1.0,"Aweful customer service. 

Pret a Manger at Lexington location was the last place I used my credit card today (2/7/18) and couldn't find it when i got home. So i looked for its phone number on the receipt but none (when all other biz lists its phone number along with its address on receipts). I went pret.com and found the number 212-292-3913 and tried several times but no one picked up the phone until it went dead. I tried a phone number of another location just to see if not picking up the phone is an isolated phenomenon or across the board; it kept ringing until it went dead again. When i sent an email on their contact page, another phone number showed up 646-728-0505 and so left a voice a message. When I came to yelp.com, there was another phone number 212-872-6274 but voice message says ""disconnected or no longer in service.""I had no way to even inquire about or trace my credit card. It was impossible to get in touch with this business and am under impression that they don't want to have any inquiry, or feedback from customers or any contact whatsoever as long as their food sells and brings money. 

Follow Up:  Out of luck, the following day, I succeeded in speaking with a person called Veronica at 646-728-0505. She said that as a responsible business they shred any credit card left behind in the store to prevent a fraud. As a responsible biz, shouldn't they have listed their correct phone number on the receipt and  should keep the card until the customer returns to claim it, or better yet, calls? She said she'd call me back after speaking to the store manager to find out if my card is still there or has been already shredded. She never kept her promise.That was quite unbelievable. Her one-minute phone call could've saved my 2-hour round trip to the store as she refused to release the store manager's phone number to me,
 
To my question why not picking up the phone, the store manager replied that no phone is installed in the store due to on-going renovation in the store. There was no renovation in the store (except some scaffold outside the building where they rent a space); even if there was, would that be a proper reason to not have a phone number, or list false numbers in public?

Pret a manger has no customer service, let alone any business philosophy, without which no business can truly succeed in a long run. What a disappointment. Pret a manger fell out of my favor."
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2014-11-28,3.0,"I came in here today after doing a little Black Friday Christmas shopping for myself. After walking about 10 blocks south and a few blocks west I saw this. I needed lunch and I know this place doesn't have wait staff so all I would I have to pay for is my food . I looked at the selections of soups, salads and sandwiches.  I picked up a large container of Thai chicken curry soup. It came with decent sized piece of crusty bread. The soup itself was very reminiscent of red curry so I immediately liked it."
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2012-08-01,4.0,"Great sandwiches, soups and snacks.  I do however miss their crawfish sandwich they used to make but make do with their roast beef, arugula and parmigiano on baguette...

The staff cares more about BSing with each other than helping customers.  They'll honestly have a line with at least 7-10 people on it and 5 people behind the register, but only one person ringing anyone up.   They're very friendly when you get up to them, but they don't seem to understand what work ethic is.   I don't blame them--I blame the manager.  First, for hiring people who don't understand what working in the service industry is about.  Second, for not providing an encouraging work environment where staff are managed in a way that sets them up for success.  Third, for walking around the store seemingly doing nothing but BSing with the team.   When I express how frustrating it is to deal with this terrible service so often she gives me attitude.   No wonder this shop is run so poorly!  She has no clue.   The food is good (though not great for you) and the people are nice, they just aren't given the skills and feedback to excel at their jobs.   With so many other places, literally next door and across the street, with staff who are actually held to standards, I honestly do not know why I continue to go here.  If there's a regional manager around, I wish they'd send in some secret shoppers to see what a sh*tshow this store is.   Leaving money on the table with this terrible service.  Such a shame."
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2013-10-23,4.0,"Pret reminds me so much of London so I have a soft spot for these chains. I would recommend of course to not go here during non-rush hour of morning and lunch because the sandwiches go slightly soggy.

After being a regular at this place (they know my usuals and would greet me by name) they changed the staff and that's when it all changed.

Everything from cold food and wrong ingredients on my orders have made me stop going there for about a month. Today I decided to give it a try again as I was craving my croissant but when I walked in I noticed it was even worst. Food displays were nearly empty, the 3 cashiers were on the floor and no one was ringing customers and when I finally got to the front and asked for a ham and cheese croissant the girl taking my order said they had bacon and cheese or mozzarella and cheese, but I usually have ham and cheese so I literally asked ""do you not have at the moment or you don't have ham & cheese croissant anymore"", and her reply? After laughing she said I J-U-S-T S-A-I-D- in the annoyed slow way you talk to 2-yrs old. I'm sorry but you only had to give me a simple and POLITE answer."
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2011-01-25,3.0,"I've been on a hunt lately.  After having recently had an out of this world Chai Tea Latte at ""The Nutbox"", I've been trying to see who has one that's even close, but without a ton of sugar inside of it.  On my way to Port Authority Bus Terminal, I came across this Pret and stopped inside to see what they had.

The interior of this Pret was pristine when I came in.  Its dark tiles were gleaming and the fridges with food were laid out perfectly.  The staff was hard at work and I noticed the fixings area for drinks was very clean and organized as well.  This is truly a place you feel good in upon entering.

The stafff was very friendly and efficient.  This was after work so I was prepared for very tired service, perhaps with a bit of attitude but there was none of that.

While not a ""Chai Tea Latte"", they did have a Chai Tea with steamed milk.  I gave it a shot and was surprised to find a teabag inside, but with a *wonderfully* frothy milk.  Upon tasting it however I have to confess to being disappointed.  The spice in the Chai barely comes through, so it tastes very weak.  I added some honey to give it a bit more flavor, but honestly there was no real saving it.  Ultimately it was a disappointing tea.

As disappointed as I was with the tea, I give this place three stars because I know the food in the chain is good and the store itself was very impressively maintained.  On top of that the service was nice, so they deserve high marks for that.  Thumbs up to the place, but I think I'll be sticking to sandwiches, soups and salads!"
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2014-01-22,5.0,"Prets are essentially identical in food offerings, so I'm giving this one 5 stars for having the friendliest workers. I stop in before work and get big smiles and nice people. It's great. Go Pret!

They added a 5 grain oatmeal that is the healthiest thing I've ever eaten. Try it."
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2011-04-28,4.0,"Look. I really like Pret. The food is always good and the only thing missing from their ginger beer is dark rum. That said, I have really stopped going there because I simply can't afford paying $12 for lunch. 

DId I mention their ginger beer is freaking awesome???"
972,pret-a-manger-new-york-18,2012-10-07,4.0,"I used to make fun of Pret. In Manhattan, you will see one in every corner. Pret here, Pret there. And I never knew how to say the name, until I actually googled it. Because if you said Pret a Manger exactly as how it's spelled, it would sound ridiculous. ""Manger"" is actually pronounced more like ""monjay"". Here's a youtube audio: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18O_wo_NX70. It's French for ""ready to eat""!

So I stopped making fun of it when I needed a healthy breakfast. To my surprise, they serve steel cut oats. It is so good. Perfectly cooked and tender, and it's not premade with a ton of unnecessary fats and sweeteners because you can actually choose what toppings you want. 

The lunch options are great as well. They have half sandwiches where you can mix and match. I love this idea because it makes for a perfect snack as well.  I like to grab a half sandwich and mix it up with soup. It's filling enough. Their sandwiches won't blow you away, but it's a quick pick me up. Their salads are great as well. 

Service is great, and everyone who works here are always smiling. I really like this place!"

The barista apologetically informed us that they had run out of almond croissants early that day. We returned the following morning to find the same barista at the counter who actually remembered us.

It is there attempt at high end fast food - and it's not altogether a bad idea.  Most of the sandwiches are freshly made each day and they always have sides, chips and soups - as well as cookies & brownie/bars to snack on.  It's a good quick fix alternative for people on the go.

Try to pick up a sammy early in the day - by day's end bread can get soggy."

The fridge on your left displays all the yummy sandwiches and wraps for sale. There's plenty of vegan and vegetarian options on the menu. Lines form quick here at lunch rush so order ahead if you can.  At least there are a few staffers behind the register and baristas in the back humming along making drinks.

Next time I'd visit and do a sit down. Ambiance feels cool and stylish.

BTW, grabbed a spicy tuna wrap this visit and boy was that spicy - it's a heat from the Jalapenos inside the wrap. This is no ordinary spicy tuna wrap. Loaded with veggies and a fantastic base mayo with the Jalapenos, gives you a nice kick. I'm not one for spicy as this was a lot more heat than I normally eat but it was really good and worth the try. My mouth was definitely feeling it! If you're into the heat and like tuna, this is the sandwich for you!"

It's organic after all at the same time the place looked so homey and modern. I wish I didn't have to run to work and soak in the scenery and quietness. 

But I was in a rush with less than 5 minutes to spare. I decided to ordered their hot oatmeal that came with honey, fresh banana slices, and cinnamon. The first red flag was that they charged $7 for this premade oatmeal. Never paid that much for oatmeal. But I figured some breakfast was better than none. I probably should have declined as soon as they told me the price because I was even more disappointed with the taste. It was so watery and the texture of the oatmeal was so gooey. It was a bowl of gluey oatmeal instead of a nice creamy and thick oatmeal. They failed to mention that the oatmeal was made with water instead their 100 types of ""mylks"". 

I give them two stars due to customer service and a great atmosphere but unless you like oatmeal in water I definitely do not recommend coming here."

The avocado toast was great and the Turkey sandwich was amazing,  we also had the gazpacho which was light and fresh tasting. 
The staff was friendly and all looked happy to be there."
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-12-30,5.0,"Great spot if you are looking for a quick lunch. My particular favorite is the avocado toast. You can get the regular size (2 pieces) or large (4 pieces). I've tried all of them, but my favorite is the protein. The hummus on top adds something a little different than your typical avocado toast. It also comes in a cute to-go box! They make really good coffees too, one of my favorites is the matcha latte. If you don't have time to order something, they also have pre-packaged options available in the refrigerator."
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-10-25,2.0,"This is insanely expensive very average food and coffee. I did not try the juices, which is was they are known for so take that into consideration when reading this review. 

I stopped by on the way to taking my husband to a doctor's visit nearby and got a coffee and an avocado toast. The avocado toast tasted fine but was on two cracker sized pieces of bread with very measly slivers of avocado on it. It cost quite a bit for this amuse bouche sized portion of food. The coffee was bitter and the almond milk they supply was also an expensive addition that was pretty tasteless. 

It was quick, which is what I needed but it wasn't worth it at all."
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-10-09,1.0,"Healthy place, extremely expensive coffee and taste is mediocre. Good working spot & decor. Would not recommended!"
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-01-11,4.0,"Spacious and very calm atmosphere especially for Midtown. See my photos! I have come at all times of the day and it has never been crowded or had crazy lines. The space is great if you want to work or meet up with someone to catch up. Very quiet, unlike many coffee shops in the area. I actually prefer this location to the one  near Bryant Park on Madison.

Their ""mylks"" are made fresh and I love their coconut milk. Their milk is absolutely superior to the typical packaged ""barista"" coconut milk or almond milk (speaking as a former barista).  Go-to drink of mine is their infused green tea (jade sencha, coconut and pineapple) with steamed coconut milk. 

Their baristas are always very nice and helpful if I have questions on menu items I have not tried yet. 

I will say beware if you have nut allergies because they only have the nut milks as options. Additionally, I will definitely agree with other Yelpers that their food items are extremely pricey. I've tried their raspberry oats and it tastes quite good but not planning to spend $7 for oatmeal again. 

Tip: If you check in, you get a free small drip coffee!"
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-12-10,1.0,"The coffee is bitter (even for latte). I used to like the healthy pastries (snacks), but there are so many more healthy places nearby that offers better service. I used ritual to order coffee ahead. Supposedly my coffee should be ready when I arrived. However, the barista/cashier only started making coffee(food) after I arrived and told her my order. She was rude and told me ""we don't have it"" with a ""go help yourself attitude"". I never care too much about services but this is definitely too much for a supposedly easy pick up order. The $5.5 latte is . Avoid at any cost."

I've had plenty of incredible tasting health food in my life. Dr. Smood disappoints and over charges along the way."

Pretty expensive for what it's worth as it was mostly watered down juice. The inside of the cafe is pretty nice and maybe they have decent things on the menu but I will definitely go to a different place next time if I'm looking for juice."
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-10-15,2.0,This place is a late night parody of what would happen if the crunchy extreme political left ran the world.  A menu consisting only of organic quinoa and avocado toast.  I got an ice coffee and an oatmeal.  price tag: $13.77.  And they have no milk because they are dairy free -- so I had to get almond milk.  Then they asked for a tip.  I may be getting punked.  Maybe this place isn't real and I'm on Candid Camera.
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-10-12,4.0,"Overall I really love Dr. Smood. If you're a healthy eater who loves organic, vegan and vegetarian options you have to check out Dr. Schmood!

With that that said lets get on to the review for this specific location. It's a short to and from Grand Central station and every time I go it's rarely ever busy. You can usually grab a table and there's hardly ever a line which is awesome. The staff can be totally hit or miss. As a person with allergies I have to be very cautious about things like nuts hiding in pesto, dairy free milks, sauces, etc. Most of the time the staff is super knowledgeable about the ingredients...other times not so much. There have been multiple occasions when I've had staff know off the top of their head what the ingredients are and what I should stay away from, and other times they refuse to even find the answer and just say ""yeah I don't know"" as they stare at me blankly. 

When it comes down to menu options the choices are vast, which I truly appreciate. However, this wide variety of options often leads to items being left out of my order. This can be extremely frustrating and time consuming. I often grab my food and go-- I shouldn't have to meticulously check that my order is right each and every time. When I sit down to eat it's almost guaranteed that I'm missing something whether it be the extra spinach, jalapeños or eggplant jerky. 

It's a wonderful space to sit and hangout....but the staff needs to be a bit more attentive to cleanliness. The chairs are gross and stained and the tables are rarely cleaned off. I've had to grin and bear it a few times when I've sat down to eat. 

Overall it's still one of my absolute favorite places to eat in the city!"
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-08-27,5.0,"The biggest upside to this Dr Smood is all the counter-space and couches to work on! It's not easy to find a space like this in midtown Manhattan, so imagine my wonderment as I stumbled mid-phonecall into this establishment and slouched into the couch for about an hour conversation. Seriously difficult to find in this area."
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-09-01,4.0,This place is really cute but pretty expensive! The blueberry majik smoodie was really good but also $11 so be prepared to drop some $$ for just a cafe
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2020-03-03,5.0,We are out of towners and were pleasantly surprised when we stumbled along this place. The cashew milk latte was to die for!!! This is a new must stop every time we come back!
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2020-02-18,3.0,"At least make sure your staff has the philosophy straight-I asked for soy milk and was haughtily told that they ""only carry Vegan milks"". Huh?
Otherwise-food ok, not great coffee (maybe it's needs a heavier ""milk to cut the bitterness). Very high prices. Cashless (I assume that will go away with the new NYC law) and one of those counter-serve places still asking for high tips (a practice Starbucks started and has since dropped)."
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-07-05,3.0,"3.5 stars. Paid $16.28 for a salmon sandwich which is very verrryyy expensive. Aside from the vegan cream cheese, you could find the same sandwich elsewhere for a fraction of its price. 

I have to admit for a healthy fast food chain, the salmon sandwich was pretty darn good and filling. There were plenty of smoked salmon and fresh slices of avocado. The bread comes warm and toasty. I couldn't really taste the vegan cream cheese but it's there. 

The space is kept clean and the staff is friendly. Free wifi and restrooms are a plus! I'm not sure if I can afford to come here regularly though."

The atmosphere and music is just so relaxing and the food and drinks are awesome. Really happy I found this spot. Highly recommend the Blue Majic Smoothie and the Spicy Avocado Toast, even though it is a tad small I would get it again."
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-02-19,4.0,"Really great place to study because they have large tables, good lighting and plenty of outlets! Their coffee is really expensive but good! Honestly I don't know if it's worth it because I don't know what good coffee is but it gets the job done although I did think it'd make me at least be like WOW that's good for a $7 cup of coffee ‍ oh well I stayed there for 4 hours and studied without any interruptions so I really can't complain!
I haven't tried their food yet but next time I'm back I will because it smelled and looked good but also very expensive and didn't smell or look good enough to make me want to try it that day. I'm sending a lot of mixed signals in this review which is making me realize I think I only liked this place for the ambience and the fact that I was productive but also I'm willing to give it another try!
Also this place only accepts credit, no cash!!!!"
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-08-06,4.0,"People, let's realize that this location is right next to Grand Central and so the real estate it's sitting on is ridiculously expensive and so therefore the rent price is built into your high coffee price. It's only fair. I met someone here for an interview I was conducting at her recommendation. Fantastic place for a meeting with a coworker, as it seems most of the people who came in were taking a lunch break, also good place to work (many folks with laptops there). Very comfortable and ample seating, not noisy, good lighting. The food is vegan-friendly and healthy--cold-pressed juices, power salads, soups, lots of avocado toasts ($8 starting) and the like."

973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-06-16,5.0,"Pros: location, drink selection
Cons: few outlets, pricey

You're walking around, get thirsty, spot this place. Yes, you should come in and try it out, and yes, it is as expensive as the interior design suggests.

I tried one of their chocolate smoothie-like drinks and it was delicious. I can wholeheartedly recommend it. It's one of those drinking that you wish had free refills. I didn't try anything from the food menu, so I can't speak to that, but if it's half as good as the drink I tried, you should give it a shot.

Sitting is a bit limited, but they have really comfy sofa/chairs near the door that make you not want to move. I can see myself coming back here in the cold of winter to enjoy a hot coffee while watching the snow fall through the huge glass walls of this place."
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2020-02-20,5.0,One of my favorite places to go to grab a coffee or do some work on my laptop! Amazing fresh juices and very good coffee. Their food is a little more expensive but it is all incredibly healthy and fresh! Plus the employees are so nice!

973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-01-25,5.0,Came in for a quick dinner. Picked out the kale cashew crunch salad and added a side of turkey for protein. It was delicious and healthy! Highly recommend
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-07-26,3.0,"This place has a really cool vibe. I went here for lunch one day since I work close by. It's a cool millennial type of place. I got a regular sandwich, which cost me $11-12. The sandwich was thin and barely filling so it's not worth the price. 

Dr. Smood is clean and the bathroom isn't dirty. It's a nice study area for when you want to get some work done. They have tables and chairs in the center for groups to sit together or tables and chairs by the window which is great to get work done or study and people watch"
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-06-03,5.0,"Stopped by for a quick sip of a perfectly sized macchiato. 

The coconut water was a tad pricey but it was delicious. Reminds me of the Harmless Coco Water that's available at Whole Foods. 

The mini cold pressed shots are reasonably priced at $5 and it actually tastes decent. 

Good service and very clean dining area. 

No cash accepted, get your magic plastic card ready."

The issue for me was the coffee. I drink a lot of coffee and this was hard for me to get down. It could easily be that I am not accustomed to the organic coffee that they serve. I typically get coffee with non fat milk. The very friendly staff informed me that they don't carry dairy products so I settled for almond milk. I sat down with my coffee and was totally thrown off when I tasted it. It was thick. It was also gritty. It left a film in my mouth. Not pleasant. Again, maybe I am not used to organic coffee but that was my experience. Yucky."
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2020-01-11,4.0,I can't say much because I've only tried the spirulina-ginger shot and the detox no. 8 cold pressed juice but my opinion on those two are that I enjoyed the shot but the juice was not tasty at all. There's an EXCESSIVE amount of ginger in it because it burned my throat on every sip. The ginger shot tasted better than the juice. I'm someone who personally drinks green juice everyday so I'm used these kind of flavors but this one just wasn't good.
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-05-12,5.0,"Friendly staff, tasty and clean food, cool atmosphere, respectfully calm and quiet and great for working. All of their food is amazing but I wish they had a larger salad variety! I come to the SoHo location almost every week. I love their nut milks (cashew lattes are my favorite) and their smoothies."
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-08-23,3.0,"I'm not usually one for the new-age wellness trend that's being passed around like the flu. I think much of it is goobly-gook cooked up for a certain demographic of the population with the means to afford it. Things like maca powder and goji berries and hemp seeds sure do make an acai bowl look better but I'm skeptical when such things are being peddled as amazing magic bullets that'll change you from the inside out. And at a ridiculous mark-up to boot. 

Everything I've tried at Dr Smood's is very tasty but be warned that the prices make it pretty health food for those with corporate expense accounts. Also, can the trend of re-naming things to make them sound ""cleaner"" or ""fresher"" please go away? ""Mylk,"" I'm looking at you. Even typing it out enrages me at how stupid that looks on my screen. 

Don't bother splurging for the juices or salads. A kale salad is a kale salad anywhere. 

What you MAY consider getting are the super-organic sweet things on the menu. Straight-up sugar in cute packaging and way more expensive than an ice cream cone but some of it is actually quite delicious. 
- Raw oats with raspberry, apple, and banana. Keep in mind that the sight of it isn't too appetizing but tastes incredible with some honey. 
- Espresso brownie bites. 
- Cacao shake. I love the bits of nuts and sugar crumbled on top. 

Also, it's very, very beautiful inside. Reminded me of a zen oasis. Big fan of the dark wooden paneling and small, gold details."

Love the location and that it's not super crowded but if you stop by, make sure to bring a parka with you as the AC is on full blast."
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2017-07-25,2.0,"A colleague and I decided to try Dr. Smood today, noticing that this location just opened up yesterday very close to our office. Peering inside, I was very excited to give this place a try. The interior definitely screams ""Manhattan organic"", looking very much like an upscale Panera Bread. Inside I noticed a cold display for some quick purchases (a cashier greets you on a tablet so that you do not need to wait in line with those ordering from the counter). Feeling hungry for lunch, however, my colleague and I both opted for the counter options.

Gazing at the menu, I was not surprised to see $10+ for a sandwich, but I was surprised to see only a handful of sandwich options on the menu. Fortunately, the sandwiches are customizable, but I would still expect some more options from a cafe. Instead, this restaurant really seems to serve a variety of coffees, teas, and smoothies, which make up the majority of the counter menu.

When we ordered, we noticed that the place felt a bit disorganized (this is day 2, though, so I'm sure they're just working out the kinks). They also did not take our names or an order number of any kind, so picking up our order was a bit disorganized (everybody seemed to order the cold turkey sandwich, which we did as well, so it was up to us to use the honor system and try to determine who ordered first). Fortunately there is plenty of seating available here, so we easily found a table for the two of us, which offered some rather comfortable cushion arm chairs.

When I unwrapped my sandwich, I was rather shocked to see how small it was. I'm talking maybe 6 inches for a full sandwich and very thin. Even worse? The sandwich really wasn't that good at all. For $10, I would expect a lot more. There's a Pret a Manger on the same block, and I could certainly find a better quality and larger sandwich for $3-4 less.

At this point, I sadly would give this place 2 stars, but I'm really hoping that they can improve the operations and the quality/size of the sandwiches (or reduce the prices). Otherwise, I'm more likely to stop by Pret or Fresh & Co. across the street (or bring a sandwich from home)."

The açaí bowl 2 go was what you would expect. Well balanced and not overly sweet. A bit on the pricey side but worth trying!"
973,dr-smood-lexington-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-08-15,2.0,"PREP STATION IS DISGUSTING!!! 
I really like the food but this location in particular is chaotic and unorganized/ unprofessional. I ordered an avocado toast with protein and was given a avo toast instead...no biggie. I just waited longer for them to adjust my order. 
What I really didn't like was how the prepping station seemed unclean and the lighting dim/ dark and just dreary. DEFINITELY NOT the appropriate lighting to prepare food. ITS NOT TIDY..and there's left over half's or just the shell of avo just sitting on the cutting board. Nasty!! 
Then at one point the manager came and proceeded to help with someone else's order and cut himself at the prep station. It can happen..however why would you proceed to put a first aid kit by the pay screen and in front of everyone proceed to attend to a bloody finger. Like WTF!! Why not exit the floor and handle that in the back office or bathroom. 
HEAD management really needs to review lighting, cleanliness and the employees way of the entire process of completing an order.

I NOTICED THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS BELOW HAVE THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE PREP STATION NOT BEING VERY CLEAN, ORGANIZED AND TIDY.
AS WELL, THE *LACK OF PREPPING SYSTEM THAT REALLY WORKS ABD IS SMOOTH/ QUICK. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PREPARING YOUR FOOD SHOULD NOT BE SWITCHING AS THE CASHIER.

Coffee is made using illy beans and pastries are house made. I've had every single coffee drink on the menu so I'll comment about espresso based drinks and coffee. 

Espresso - beans are freshly grinded (as required for a good shot) and the barista does a super good job pulling it. Espresso shot cuts through any espresso based drink. 

Coffee is good for brewed coffee. The iced coffee and cold brew coffee is actually pretty much the same thing. Try their red eye as they do a good job on the espresso shot and it actually comes through past the coffee.

One tip is on a cold summer day and want a sugary drink - get their version of the frappe. It's not too sweet but taste amazing!

There were people congregated outside in the drizzling rain waiting for this place to open, to no avail.  I don't appreciate walking in the rain, jonesing for java just to be disappointed.  I am a glutton for punishment because I walked back again at 8 am hoping that they were open but NOPE!!"
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2017-10-20,5.0,This is a little gem. Darling workers and great coffee and baked items. I will be back!
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2017-01-25,4.0,I went here for cappuccino and just loved the drink. They also give you an option for most of the drinks-2 or 3 shots espresso. They have daily flavored sugarless coffees. My friend got a hot chocolate and loved it. Service is a little slow as it is a one woman shop. But super cute cafe. Loved to try something  other than starbucks. Would definitely recommend this place.
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2015-11-13,5.0,"I gave the 5 star rating strictly just for the Hot Chocolate. 
I went here on a colder fall night. Didn't want coffee at night, so got their hot chocolate.
The hot chocolate was really creamy and they used real dark chocolate shavings. Even after the hot chocolate became a little bit colder it was still good. I will go back just for the hot chocolate."

Recommended!!!"
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2014-11-14,4.0,"I am a big fan of caffeine and I found this place with the help of good ratings from other yelp reviews.

Environment:
We came here on a really cold day in November, and this place was really toasty.  There were dimmed lights and a nice quiet setting.  It was a very comfortable setting.

Coffee:
The coffee here isn't exactly cheap, but you're paying similar prices to Starbucks  (maybe a little more).  The quality of the coffee was pretty good.  We both got the mocha, and it was sweet but not too sweet.  It had a good balance between the espresso and the chocolate.  You could also taste the quality of rich chocolate as well.

If you don't want coffee, they also serve fresh squeezed orange juice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're looking for a nice quiet place that serves quality caffeinated drinks, this would be the spot.  We almost missed this place looking for it.  It's not a hole in the wall, but if your not looking specifically looking for this place, you would definitely miss a good coffee spot."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2014-06-09,4.0,"Excellent little cafe shop located Midtown East.  It had a great selection of flavors for espresso, cafe, cappucino or anything else.  The large spread of cookies were starring at me while I was ordering, but I was successful in resisting the temptation although they looked heavenly.

They did seem to have a limited lunch menu with some little sanGwiches, but I didn't get anything other than the espresso.  Overall, it was very clean with 4/5 stools to sit and chat a bit but a good spot to get a little extra energy boost.

FYI - no credit card transactions under $5.

Buon Appetito"
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2014-03-13,5.0,"-the best, BEST, hot chocolate I've ever had. I get it often.
-great selection of savories + sweets. Always something for what your craving.
-nice gals that remember your order.
-a small hole in the wall kind of place, but the best turtle bay coffee shop by far."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2016-01-29,5.0,"Came in here almost every single day for the summer after I discovered this gem. The store is very quaint and small, but much more relaxed compared to the coffee shops around the area. The hot chocolate and mocha are phenomenal. Their pastries are also delicious. I have had the chocolate croissant and turkey and cheese and loved both of them. Definitely a wonderful spot for coffee."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2013-06-21,4.0,"I have been searching for a crepe place endlessly in Midtown East. Although they don't mention it on their website, this cafe makes sweet and savory crepes. The place is small and when you walk in, the crepes menu is on the wall next to the door on your right (it's a little hard to see although they have the menu pop up too on their tv screen).

I got the spinach, mushroom, and cheese crepe for $9.  You get a choice between swiss and fontina-I picked fontina since it's a little saltier.  The crepe is definitely big and they add a lot more vegetables than cheese so it's not greasy or weighs you down. Swiss and fontina are a bit similar so I wish they had a strong cheese option like goat. Beggars can't be choosers though.

Next time, I'll try a sweet crepe. Someone mentioned too much nutella in their crepe, but I've never heard of too much nutella (that would be blasphemous) so I'll give it a try. I also saw someone get a Coolhaus ice cream sandwich here too, so that's an option."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2016-06-06,4.0,"Drinks are above average. I like a place that has an actual espresso. But there's no space to sit and enjoy it which takes away from the experience. Although they take credit cards, they heavily prefer cash."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2014-08-22,4.0,"small place, but has great coffee.  I got the cafe mocha, and it was soooo good.  The expresso was strong enough but the coffee still tasted creamy and flavorful.  Definitely worth walking for!

It looked like they also and crepes, which i would have loved to try, but they didn't serve them in the morning."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2016-04-15,5.0,"I had the double cappuccino to go-illy coffee. It was divine. Also, decided on the double chocolate donut and it was moist and delicious! As I was waiting, I noticed someone had ordered a made to order crepe-looked delicious as well. Great little place-try it, you won't be disappointed!"
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2013-02-20,2.0,"A tiny coffee shop with real French employees.
I was craving crepes so I found this place on Yelp.  The menu revolves on a giant flat screen and the crepe menu was hidden above a drink fridge.  The crepe was ginormous and I couldn't finish it but there was way too much nutella inside.  I felt like I was eating nutella on a thin pancake.  Too much nutella?  Yes this can be a problem.  I think someone else mentioned this in another review, but I thought how could there be too much nutella?  

The hot chocolate was not so good.  It was very bitter, I think they use powdered bittersweet chocolate and mix it with steamed milk.  There was not sweetness to it.

The pastries on the other hand looked great and I noticed that's what everyone else was ordering, along with fresh illy coffee.  Maybe I'll try again."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2012-12-07,5.0,"The staff was great, super funny and helpful. The coffee is delicious and the panini was good. 

Only downside is that there is limited bar-like seating. 

I would recommend this place for good coffee."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2013-03-14,5.0,"I love this nice tucked away little coffee shop. They brew illy coffee which I like. The staff here are SUPER friendly and super nice. I suggest that you try the cookies or brownies right when they come out of the oven, they are decadent.

People complain that this place has no seating and whatever....but I don't think that the seated coffee chat forum is what they are going for. Most people that come here are business/finance people needing a recharge anyway. That said, there are barstools in there if you and a friend wanted to stay a bit longer.

I usually just get the black iced coffee so unfortunately I can't speak for much else. but just the friendliness and enthusiasm of the staff keeps me coming back here over and over. I always smile and have a laugh when I am in the coffee shop. That means a lot to me!"
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2011-01-16,4.0,"Passed by this place on my way to Moma! Small but good coffee. The owner was friendly. Quiet. The music was really good, mellow mix; perfect for reading while waiting for a friend on a cold night. Cafe au lait had the right amount of milk.

Tips: Only a few stools for the sitting area and there's $10 minimum on your card."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2016-12-09,5.0,"Great small coffee place in midtown east. In town for a few days and I went here every morning for coffee. Great espresso and lattes, took care in their preparation. Very friendly staff. Will come back!"

974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2015-03-25,5.0,Hands down the best Espresso Cafe on 146 East 49th Street. Not only do they have the friendliest customers but they could sell you water and it'd taste delicious.
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2011-05-11,4.0,"A great little spot to grab a quick coffee. illy: espresso drinks, drip, and even flavored if that's your bag.

The panini are served on focaccia bread, with ingredients like prosciutto, speck, arugula, fontina, etc.

I've had only one crepe (fontina & prosciutto cotto), which was irresistibly delicious.

One quasi-irrelevant note: I'm hopelessly enamored of the ""art"" on the walls, the Sylvain Pitiot & Pierre Poupon maps of Burgundy."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2013-03-30,2.0,"Before I knock it, I will say they have good coffee AND Doughnut Plant is sold here.  YUM  It's a cute microscopic place that is definitely more a grab and go spot.

My biggest gripe is the service.  The two women are noticeably nicer to male customers than females.  I've been here a few times and have witnessed this firsthand.  They'll smile and converse with males, but if you're a female, WHEN they acknowledge you, they'll treat you as if you're infringing on their time.  It's so strange.  My coworkers, on separate occasions, have noticed this also.  

They also have a $10 min credit card requirement, which makes it a bit hard when all you want is an espresso."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2011-10-20,4.0,"Delicious cappuccino with illy espresso. 

The drip coffee was high quality I'm sure but not really my taste, a little bit sour for my liking. 

I love that they carry Macaron Cafe macarons and Doughnut Plant doughnuts, even though they are both overpriced, especially here. 

It's funny and a little bit of a bummer that they only carry crepes during lunchtime and not breakfast, so I haven't gotten the chance to try them yet. 

The girls that work here really take their time. There is an exceptionally sweet girl with a European accent and a really funny asian chick that can  be sweet but knows how to put some of her more ornery regulars in their place. Nice balance :)"
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2015-02-01,4.0,"Nice small place to grab a coffee in midtown. Pastries are very good, all drink items are nicely done. There are not more than 6-7 sitting places, so it may be hard to find a seat."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2012-10-25,3.0,"For a $4 small cup of cappuccino, it was nothing special. Their bakery items looked a lot more appealing.."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2011-01-04,4.0,"I'm beginning to realize that nutella is just not something you can have too much of, no matter how good the first couple of bites are.

I came here during my lunch break, specifically to try out the crepes.  Not realizing how large and filling they would be, I ordered two, so that I could purchase with a credit card ($10 minimum) and also because I'm a gluttonous fatass (on the inside).

I figured I'd try one that was sweet - nutella with banana (they don't have strawberries, only jam), and one that was savory - turkey and swiss cheese (i asked for ham but they had run out).

I ended up only eating the nutella crepe and having the turkey to go. As I had mentioned, I wasn't expecting so much - portion-wise from a single order. So $6.50 plus tax seems like a reasonably fair price.  It's definitely enough to split with another person.

The crepes are served on a plate, to be eaten with a fork and knife (not for on-the-go) and things got really messy for me. The lady did not hold back with the nutella - there was a lot! First couple of bites in were so good - piping hot, sweet, and fluffy. But it really ended up being just too much (I blame my own fatassery).

Lesson to be learned - come here for the crepes but don't be greedy!"
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2012-03-03,2.0,"They have Illy coffee... that's why I went.... it may have been a fluke, for some reason the latte didn't taste right... it was too bitter (reminded me of Starbucks-burn)...

Their pastries were yummy though and service was good.

It's a hole in the wall place to go and pick up your morning coffee on the way to work.... since it's a bit out of the way for me, I probably wouldn't go here again as I found some other options that are closer."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2012-01-17,3.0,"A really cute cafe to stop in for a quick coffee or small bite. It has the same feel as Joe the Art of Coffee (with the pastries all in the front) except definitely a smaller space. Cappuccino is yummy though! 

Not a good place for sitting and reading though. I was disappointed since my boyfriend and I had both brought books but again, a good place to stop and pick up a coffee."
974,manhattan-espresso-cafe-new-york,2008-07-16,5.0,"Yeah - easily one of the better independent coffee shops in mid-town, if not the entire city - seriously.  You cant go wrong with their coffee!

If you are in for something different - stop by at lunch for a crepe!  They are amazing - there are a selection of both lunch and dessert oriented crepes if you are in the mood for something sweet!"
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2020-06-10,5.0,I had really specific instructions for my cake delivery because it was a surprise and I didn't know the exact address.

975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2020-05-24,5.0,"I adore Paris Baguette but they deserve props for being open on Sundays, when Midtown East is mostly shut down. 

This is the best egg salad sandwich I think I've ever eaten. No crust. Cucumber. Just perfect. 

They also have lower cal cakes than the typical bakery. Even if they are fudging the calorie counts on croissants (no way the almond is as low as they claim), they make lighter desserts in the Parisian style. 

I tried a blueberry yogurt cake (not eaten it yet) with yogurt frosting rather than buttercream. 

And they're so nice, always. 

Delicious food and a pleasant seating area."
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2020-03-28,5.0,"I just want to give a shout out to Deniz of Paris Baguette 591 Lexington Ave. branch for making me and my colleagues day beautiful for making it possible for these amazing and delicious mini fruit bites, despite of short notice. It's actually my very first order of business with them and for sure it won't be the last. I'm looking forward to try PB's other creations. The interior of the store was small but cozy, the smell of freshly baked pastries and bread will greet you as you entered the room. Your eyes will go frenzy gazing to their eye catching displays of sandwiches, pastries, breads and cakes. A little pricey but I guess your paying for quality and taste."
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2019-12-09,5.0,"I was going to go to the Starbucks across the street for a pastry but my dad convinced me to try something new, and I'm all the better for it. Paris Baguette was tres magnifique. 

As soon as I walked in, the smell of freshly baked bread filled the air and I couldn't help but smile. I was overwhelmed by the displays of sandwiches and pastries and wanted to eat all the carbs. 

I had the croquet monsieur, which was basically a fancy ham & cheese sandwich. It was freshly toasted and warm in my hand. The crust was solid, and the middle was soft perfect. My dad had the turkey mozzarella focaccia sandwich which had some seasoning on it that was incredible.

In addition to multiple displays of pastries and sandwiches, there was also a large display of desserts. We didn't get to try any of them but should I ever find myself on the corner of 52nd and Lexington, I would absolutely give the cakes a try. It's a tough job, but someone's got to eat cake instead.

There isn't too much seating in the little cafe, but we got lucky and got a table immediately. It seems most of PB's customers take their orders to go, so ample seating isn't really a necessity."
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2019-02-01,4.0,"The fanciest PB I've ever seen. Maybe cause I'm use to the ones in queens. I ordered the tomato soup and got an iced latte. 

It's a really cute cafe to get my work done while waiting for my bf to end work. 

Only wish it was a bit warmer, they have two opening doors one from each side of the store. Every time the door opened you felt the frosty cold air."
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2020-01-27,5.0,Great service from Marc. Try the garlic croissant. It sounds strange but is delicious. Tasty desserts.

975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2019-05-31,4.0,"I think these reviewers have this confused with Maison next door tbh! It's a nice spot, has delicious pastries but on the expensive side. I find everyone here fast, attentive and always greeted with a smile. This is by far what Maison on Lexington should aspire to, customer service and the pastries are amazing. Yes, it is on the expensive side but it's a place to chill drink some coffee and not worry about attitude. Only con I have is there is a small area to sit so you are squashed and has few outlets to charge if you need to plug in."
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2019-04-24,4.0,"I picked up a pastry for my partner the other day here. No line, everything was clean and the pastries all looked crazy yummy. Wish there was something lemony though!"
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2018-04-27,4.0,"My friend and I stumbled upon Paris Baguette while walking to the 53rd St. Subway Station.  We both halted when we looked in the window.  Anyone inside probably had a good laugh as we pointed and oohed and ahhed at the display of goodies. 

We had various items, all I wish I remembered the names of to properly review, but alas cannot recall.  The macarons were delicious, flavorful and soft.  There was a small strawberry and cream filled pastry that was amazing, only a couple bites worth, so buy a couple.  My friend had a lemon curd pastry, she was almost went back and got a couple more for the road.  I also tried the hash brown bread and was slightly disappointed with it, but I think that was because I had put it in the fridge of our hotel and ate it much later, so it was cold and not freshly made.

I will make it a point to get another treat next time I am in town, so I can try some more goodies."
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2019-06-17,3.0,"I kinda have to agree with a lot of the reviewers who said customer service here was bad. We stopped by and no other customers were inside, just 3 workers behind the counter.  We asked what they recommended as far as pastries and they pretty much just stared at us. One guy did finally spoke up and said the croissants were good so we picked an almond croissant along with a couple of royal puddings and some juices. The croissant turned out stale and the juices were ok. But three stars alone for just the royal pudding. It comes in a little glass jar for $4 and I could've eaten 5 of them by myself it was so good."
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2018-02-16,4.0,"I think that in general macarons are seriously overrated and overpriced for what they really are--an average pastry.

However, THIS place has some pretty tasty macarons and I was pleasantly surprised when I bit into mine and there was some yummy strawberry jam in there.

I really wanted to try one of their ""hash brown bread"" things, but I was totally put off by the fact that anyone can just put their hand in there and reach for the baked goods and bread, as I saw an old man do without gloves or a napkin. Yuck! I don't want those germs.

Paris Baguette, please find a more sanitary way to make your wonderful pastries available to the public and I'll happily give you five stars."

I ended up going across the street to Starbucks"
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2019-02-01,4.0,"Even if there wasn't much option for me, or I couldn't get a full size cake, I feel that I like this place for no reason, I got the cookies and I like it tastes and its packing, I wish that I live in NYC to have more time to try this place not in rush. 
I don't remember if the staff was smiling or not since I'm writing this after about a month of my visit, but if I saw smiling staff in NYC I was be surprised, it's rare to find nice staff at any place and I don't understand why. But it would be a plus if they smile specially early bird mornings when people need this positive energy."

975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2016-11-29,4.0,"I've always had pastries and my latte from Paris Baguette back in Atlanta, but I wanted to write about this one particularly because it was the first time I had ordered a full-sized cake from them.  It was a last minute purchase since I didn't have time to make my friend's birthday cupcakes.  Truthfully I was really hesitant because we both tend to refrain from eating sweets or anything too sweet.  Having had my full run of Paris Baguette pastries, I knew they tend to run a little on the sweeter end, and I was nervous about getting a full-sized birthday cake with it being chock full of sugar.  However, I was quite mistaken!

Coconut Mango Creme Cake: I believe this was a 10"" inch cake covered with shredded coconut and light cream.
PROS:
- super soft and fluffy cake, literally the lightest thing I've had in NYC
- barely a tinge of sweetness in the cake: perfect!
- light cream which didn't overload the cake
- nice chunks of mango in between the layers
- comes with candles, a lighter, and a cake cutter!!! IT'S PERFECT.

CONS:
- does not feed a staff of 15 people haha.

The cake was devoured and GONE within 15 minutes of hitting the office folks.  That's how good this cake was.  I'm totally coming here for cakes in the future."

Christmas music was being played. The bakery is well lit and was clean for a 12:30 afternoon. It was not too crowded and there were patrons sitting, having their sandwiches and soups.
I stayed in here for about 25 minutes because I was browsing and taking in all the cute and pretty pieces of baked goods.
The pantries were well stocked and if certain items were running low, a staff member was on his/her way filling up the empty rows.

They have a selection of 3 hot soups and next to it are baguettes and demi baguettes for sale. 
The sandwich and salad selections are quite big compared to other paris baguettes I had been to around Manhattan.

I ended up buying 3 pieces of red bean buns, but I would've bought more had I not had to go to any appointments of any sorts.

oh! I almost forgot to write about the drinks. 
The drinks menu were kept to a very basic menu such as, teas, coffee, holiday specials, and tea lattes special. The one in Edison, NJ has azuki drinks, misugaru, and other Korean inspired flavors of drinks.

Staff members were nice and were in good moods overall.

I will definitely be coming back again."

Extremely rude and especially from an employee at Paris Baguette. Use to go to the one a lot in Korea town and have never received lesser than perfect customer service. She needs a lesson in customer service ASAP."

975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2015-08-04,4.0,"Paris Baguette is an established Korean institution of baking and culinary excellence (since 86') when it comes to pastries. Like its name it focuses on the French inspired pastries such as croissants but also adds the Korean influence in the form of green tea flavored red bean buns and Classic Asian pastries.


This location lacks in the Asian flavored items but offers a lot of things that would appeal to the masses (macarons, little fruity and creamy pastries and cheesecakes, green tea rolls and sponge cakes). I was delighted to discover that they've tried to create the cronut. Now this is trademarked so they might want to call it something else such as the other bakeries that are churning this product out (Millie fuellie which I can never spell on la guardia and chikalicious to name a few). 

They had a peachy flavored one I decided to try. It was delicious! And I don't have to wait in a stupid line early in the morning like a scourge.

The other thing they can do well is smoothie and iced drinks. They're a little bit on the sweet side for me but very tasty to have a green tea strawberry mojito. I wanted to have a green tea smoothie or latte but they were out of matcha. Until the next time I guess.

They also have random savory things like sandwiches for those on the go. Nothing spectacular but good enough for lunchtime! The space is small (seats maybe 10-15?) so don't come here with a ton of peeps!"
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2017-07-08,4.0,"Ok place , cronut i tried is very heavy with oil and sugar not worth the money , really wanted to like , but i dont 
Still give 4 stats for location and view"
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2018-03-09,1.0,"If desserts in Paris tasted so lackluster, I wouldn't go as often as I do. France is known for luscious desserts and for this place to have the capital in it's name is laughable. The desserts are bland in flavor and certainly do not give you a feeling that you are going to indulge in something delicious. It's like wanting a Chanel 2.55 purse and getting a plastic street knockoff from someone who whispers to you in hushed tones. 

The quality of the desserts is bad and the prices are high for a taste of air. I have, on occasion, seen bugs roaming around on the pastries and have seen a trail of garbage juice from the disposal to the entrance. That in addition to the fact that the employees are rude as sin (one cashier threw my dessert at me once it was bagged) does make me feel like I'm in a different country, but certainly not France. That would be a country where the people have no manners. Yikes. I'll stick to Eric Kayser's bakeries for some delicious, decadent treats."
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2019-01-14,2.0,"They serve soup and don't have spoons. Need I say more? This place is really disappointing since it used to have a really good selection of cheap pastries and plenty of seating but they redid the inside to look nicer I guess. They took out all the seating and now just sell a bunch of soggy looking sandwiches (and soups but no spoons, like seriously reiterating that because, what the heck?!) It's a total shame because the employees seem decent enough but I immediately got a much better selection at the Maison pastry shop right next door."
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2019-01-27,1.0,"I love going to the different spots around the city, but this location, I go in Sunday 01/27 around 4pm, I ask the last for a caprese sandwich, she prepares it for me and was very nice, meanwhile I go to pay with this girl, I literally say ""Do you guys have water cups here? Do you give free water?"" She keeps saying ""There are water bottles in the fridge"" repeating in like 4 times in a very rude way, without even looking at me. Very disappointed. Customer service is way more important than anything else."

I could also say..naneun dangsin-eul salang haeyo            
Which means the same thing in Korean, the language used at the headquarters of this amazing bakery and patisserie !

Everything I had was just outstanding, the Pain au Chocolat and the Fruit Tart were so good !!   Flaky, tasty, crisp, delicious...  overall very good... and I have been to Paris many times, and I am very happy with Paris Baguette.

You can find many stores around NYC (and other US and World cities)...some are large and offer a wide menu, some are smaller and have the basic, key pastries, breads and cakes that have made them famous.   

Stop by and delight your senses !!"
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2019-04-19,1.0,I agree with other reviews - selections and quality have gone down and prices have gone up after the store renovation late last year.  I used to go there to pickup breakfast pastries all the time. Not anymore even though my office is a block away.  Very disappointing.
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2016-09-27,5.0,"This place has gone through major improvement.  Staff is always super friendly and the lines move quickly. It's my go to spot every morning. 

The only thing I wish they would work on is writing the drink orders on the cups for the baristas (Starbucks style). Making the orders queued up and hard to miss. Right now, the cashiers yell out the drinks and there's usually only 1 barista, so I can see how they can miss one or go out of order."
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2018-05-06,4.0,"It's Paris Baguette. Clean. Fast food-style self serve sweet and savory baked goods. Stocks obviously tend to dwindle at the end of the day. 

One star off because despite the calorie displays, you will still somehow lose self-control."
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2017-09-16,1.0,I am always fan of Paris Baguette. But the coconut mango cake I bought yesterday is very terrible. I found one mosquito or fly in the cake. It is so DISGUSTING!!!
975,paris-baguette-new-york-6,2016-12-21,4.0,"Stopped by after brunch down the street to get some sweets. Ate them when I returned back to New Jersey and wow they were delicious. You wouldn't think they would still be soft since the baked goods are just sitting out waiting to be grabbed. So good, I got the chocolate ganache and something with Nutella inside. The one with Nutella inside was a rip off, the Nutella in the inside was the size of a quarter when the baked good was the size of my palm. They have one in Edison so good that there is one in New Jersey yay."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2019-12-08,5.0,"David's Tea is my favorite place to stock up on loose tea. They have a vast array of teas, tea pots and thermos to choose from and the staff is friendly and patient. Today I took my time deciding which teas to buy, and I didn't feel rushed at all. They always have two or three teas to sample. I find this a great way to try something new with no risk involved. To be honest, I'm not a fan of all of their choices. Some taste too artificial to me but there are definitely options that are more natural tasting. I tend to like dessert teas. If you like the same, I'd recommend chocolate macaroon (black tea- caffeine), creme caramel rooibos (rooibos, caffeine free), forever nuts (their most popular tea and herbal, caffeine free), and blueberry muffin (herbal, caffeine free)."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2019-05-15,4.0,"Ever since teavana closed down i've been desperately searching for a replacement. Davidstea definitely meets expectations. 

I love how colorful the stores are laid out and how friendly and helpful the staff is. 

I was recommended the Buddha's Blend by a staff member and it was amazing. 

They have constant sales and sell great mugs and teaware. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2019-03-14,5.0,"I introduced my coworkers to this place and now my whole office is hooked. I first discovered David's Tea in Canada and was so excited to find out there's a location so close to me in NYC! I cannot begin to explain how many different kinds of tea they have here; they definitely have something for everyone. The staff is also incredibly nice and patient, and are happy to give suggestions and let you smell samples of all their tea. My favorites are the jasmine creme brulee, banana nut muffin, blueberry muffin, hot chocolate, and chocolate macaroon. All of their teas taste EXACTLY like their names! You'll never go back to Teavana again."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2017-12-09,5.0,"Best tea place! Forget overpriced teavana and come check our this Canadian tea place!

I fell in love with this brand in Toronto and never looked back. They use whole real ingredients like chocolate morsels, candy cane, ginger etc... you can taste the difference!

Try chocolate rocket, sleigh ride and coffee pur'eh

Yum"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2017-11-03,1.0,"I have always enjoyed DavidsTea, despite not all the teas being organic. Last Friday I was in the store at 11:30 and dealt with Shanice-who was lovely. However she charged me for an item I did not purchase and I didn't notice until I got home. Long story short, I've spoken to Walter 3 times over the course of a week, and spoke to Robert the supervisor today who said he would call back in ""20 minutes"" and never did. Now spoke to Walter again this afternoon and with no apology for any of this run around, he says I would have to come back to the store to have my money refunded. This is insane. I'm so disappointed with the lack of followup and customer service.  I'll be there on Monday to collect my refund, but never again after that. Oh and side note, this was a $9 charge. At this point it's just for principal."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2017-11-01,5.0,"Tea addict? Check this spot out! Loose teas for days, from green tea to oolong to herbals. This is the place to be. 

Everything you want in one shop, and their ""Cold 911"" will cure any stuffy noise or soar throat. ( at least it does for me an my family)"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2019-06-04,3.0,"Convenient location for me. All the teas are well organized and a good spot. Don't expect a warm welcome here. It felt very cold and transactional. I was trying to ask questions and make conversation and he was not having it. Buy your tea and get out was the attitude. Not sure if it was just for me. If you can order online or go downtown, even better. I feel absolutely welcome downtown. I blame the manager, not the employee."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2014-11-27,5.0,"The staff here is amazing and I have walked away with a pleasant tea experience every time!  Not only are they knowledgable about their teas and in running the store but they have such a personal and inviting aurora around them.  They greet you when you enter the store, offer you a free sample of the tea they have currently brewed (it's hot but not to the point where it'll burn your tongue), give you a 30-second mini tour of their place if you look a little lost (or baffled by their wide selection like I was), and let you sniff as many tea leaves as you want.  You never get the feeling that they're there to make money off of you.

David's Tea is both a cafe AND a tea shop.  You can order your drink (~$4) and they'll brew it for you on the spot.  They offer different types of sweeteners: sugar, agave, steavia, honey, etc.  Can be made hot or cold, with or without milk.  They also sell tea leaves by the ounce and teapots, mugs, infusers, gift sets, etc. 

Their Cold 911 is also helping me recover from my congestion!  It's peppermint, juniper, and eucalyptus tea!  Highly recommend if you're feeling a little sick.

They also have a rewards card and holiday promotions!"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2016-12-25,4.0,"I love loose tea, and David's Tea does loose tea wonderfully. There are so many options here, from traditional teas like gyokuro and baihao yinzhen to interesting blends that include pieces of popcorn and seasonal flavors with sprinkles in the mix. Whatever type of tea you like, David's Tea will have it, and their prices are very reasonable considering what you are getting.

The staff is friendly and they will take their time with you and let you smell the different teas before deciding which one you want. You can buy tea for home, or they will make a cup of it for you right there.

If you love tea, and you find yourself in this area, it's well worth a visit."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2017-12-16,4.0,"I was first introduced to David's Tea by my cooperating teacher back when I was student teaching at a high school in that area. One day I was having a rough time because my schedule was packed and I was super under the weather. She kindly told me to take the afternoon off and sent me to David's Tea for some rest and rehydration.

Even though the teas are pricey, they are very fragrant and there is a wide selection of teas and blends to pick from. I love the cute decor and the couches and outlets in the back. It's a nice place to do work because it's typically quiet and you can concentrate.

For that sick day, the Organic cold 911was very helpful. They also have rose tea, lavender, different green teas, and citrusy ones. I also enjoy some of their iced teas a lot, such as the peach one. Great for gifting."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2018-07-21,4.0,A Teavana substitute for those who miss the stores that Starbucks killed-off. Lots of flavors and varieties of teas to choose from and tons and tons of tea accessories. Be warned though that many of the teas contain artificial flavorings -- just like the old teas from Teavana.
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2018-07-17,5.0,Soooo good! Tried the Midsummer Night's Dream tea and it was amazing! Really clean storefront with great service. Definitely coming back when I go back to NYC!
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2017-02-20,5.0,"So many teas so little time!!

Awesome, friendly, knowledgeable staff! Lots of recommendations based on my likes and wants. Haven't paid yet but don't care!!  

Not a LOT of seating, but good enough if you're social and don't mind meeting other people!  Had a picnic table, small round table for four and a 4-seater couch and coffee - ahem- tea table!"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2017-05-26,1.0,"I recently visited with a coupon for a ""free tea"" (given to me at a food and wine event in San Francisco) and was not only treated poorly, but told the coupon would only be valid for the ""sample tea of the day.""   The tea that the manager (a tall black man) offered me was poured from a plastic container and not made to order, which is what I would expect from a proper tea shop.  Needless to say, I will not be back after this experience.  It would have been nice to preface the coupon with these conditions.  Had I known, I would not have wasted my time. 

The tea itself (guava with hibiscus) tasted AWFUL and full of artificial flavors.  Even Teavana, owned by Starbucks's, has better quality tea.  Don't waste your time or money here.  $4 for a cup of tea and $8 for a matcha is laughable."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2017-09-22,5.0,"Very clean, bright, and white-wall spot for delicious tea. They have different types of cow's milk and also soy for those who need or prefer dairy-free. There is a whole wall of tea and I tried the pumpkin chai with soy milk. Delicious! It was the perfect temperature and steeped just perfectly. There are also some nice gift sets on the wall and a lot with a discounted price. Good to keep in mind for teacher gifts or housewarming presents. Speaking of teachers, I came by for a complimentary tea for a weekend promotion for teacher appreciation. I felt very appreciated by David and his tea. Thank you!"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2014-07-12,4.0,"A refreshing summer sample of an iced Watermelon Mint tea led me into DavidsTea on the Upper East Side today.  I was intrigued by the endless amount of unique flavors, specifically those of the new Carnival Collection.  Caramel Corn, Cherry Snowcone, Root Bear Float... each blend smelled mind-boggling delicious!  And then there was the Cotton Candy tea... a fun tea blend of Cotton Candy colored bits and pieces.  I decided to get it as an iced tea for my walk home.  It was the most delicious and unique iced tea I've ever had- no sweeteners needed!  

Another plus- the store is extremely clean and the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable.  All the exciting flavored tea blends will certainly have me back in no time!"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2016-07-15,4.0,Love their iced soy lattes!  Such heavenly aroma when you enter the shop and lots of eye candy.
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2016-07-15,5.0,"I love David's Tea! The minute you walk in the aroma tea is just so calming, inviting and relaxing. The colors of product items are so neat! Looks like a cotton candy store. I love the logo teal color. I ordered the chocolate banana iced tea and it's delicious! My friend ordered cotton candy iced tea. Both refreshing in this hot summer weather. Try it! I end up buying more tea. There's a sale going on too that if you buy 4 ounces of tea you get the colorful canisters."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2016-06-04,5.0,"David's tea can only be described as a place that really embraces the art of tea making. I've passed it multiple times and I've always wanted to wonder in. 

When you walk in your greeted by a bubbly nice lady at the front. They also have the tea of the day which was absolutely amazing. They have a lot of teas that you can sniff and see if you like. On top of it all they have pressers so that you don't need tea bags and you can freshly brew your tea through a filter that's built inside the mug thermos bottle I mean they have everything you can think of to put tea into. I smelled so many teas my favorites were the pom~diggity, pura vida which was as a very fresh green tea and red velvet cake which was this black tea that had milk chocolate&white chocolate sprinkles, beetroot powder and a lot of other amazing things.

The staff was beyond the point of helpful. They opened so many containers of tea for me to smell. They taught me how to make the tea they even provided me with the sample of the day. There so kind, and attentitive they asked if I had any allergies before making any recommendations and were very down to earth.

I wouldn't suggest the pistachio icecream iced latte, it was bitter sweet and I didn't really enjoy it but the quality of there tea amazes me. 

I would definitely recommend visiting, they currently have a promotion when you buy one of there travel mugs through the summer for $15, they let you refil it with the tea of the day for 1 dollar or 2 dollars for any tea you want until end of August. It's a good deal if you have the location next to you.

Viva la tea drinking!!!"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2016-03-08,5.0,"I've visited DavidsTea quite a few times due to the fact that it's right by my school but recently it has became my number 1 spot to grab a drink. There is a huge selection of tea from white to herbal, fruity to nutty and I find myself torn over several options every single time before finally settling on one. 

All their teas smell AMAZING. They have weird flavors that you wouldn't think possible as tea like banana nut bread, raspberry cream pie, pistachio ice cream (the nutty ones smell sooo good omg). Ive tried mostly the fruity teas and my favorite one thus far is the fruit of paradise, one of their new teas in the spring collection, iced and sweetened with agave syrup. It literally smells like paradise and tastes like paradise. You can get your tea as is, as a latte or as a tea pop (fizzed).

The store itself is very cute with their products displayed (I want everything on those racks) and a cozy, quiet seating place in the back. The staff there are all so friendly and attentive and will pull out any tea you are interested in to smell and not groan when you smell all on the rack yet choose none. 

This is my new go to spot for a refreshing drink to go through my classes and I can't wait to try all the different types of tea!"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2016-03-04,4.0,"They have a great selection of teas, but was not a fan of their actual teas. I went there for the first time for 2016 Leap year ""get a free tea"" promo.. and they were offering only two choices: apple pie and strawberry parfait rhubarb... I chose the latter because the apple pie was very bland and tasteless. The strawberry was tart and like sugarfree water if that means anything.... I didnt taste much in it. Im giving it a 3.5 stars and the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it wasnt as good because of the promo or maybe it was just watered down... not sure but that flavor was not good. 

If I went next time, i would try their green teas to see how they compare to asian tea and other brands like Teavana and Argotea.

I do have a tea infuser (Called Infuser 2-in-1) from them ($10) that is great!"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2016-04-24,4.0,"I got the silk dragon jasmine tea with agave and skim milk and it was free because of my card!  
I'm beginning to think that I should probably stop ordering hot teas here because it's never as good as I hope. They're always lacking in sugar and you barely taste the milk.
I think I'll come back here when the weather gets hotter and get some iced teas. 
I saw a canister of tea labeled cherry blossom and I'm sure that is going to taste really good cold, so that's next on my list"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2013-07-01,4.0,"I'm giving this place 4 stars based on their superb service.  As for their teas, 3 stars.  

All the employees were amazing.  They really take the time to recommend a tea for you if you ask for it and they let you smell the various leaves that you're interested in.  In only a short span of 1 hr, we got to know all the employees for that day and they even gave us a free davdstea coupon.  I gave one of the workers a North Shore Animal League coupon but they were in no way a consequence/result of one another.  

I really like the decor of the place and the roominess.  It's an extremely relaxing atmosphere.  I like this setup better than Kusmi's Tea. Great place to hang out during the hot summer days.

As for the tea, despite the strong aroma from the tea leaves, it failed to translate into my cup of green tea (forgot which type).  The tea wasn't brewed long enough and I don't even think the water was hot enough.  What would be better idea is if they just gave you the entire pot and you just ""brew"" it yourself.  It would be a different business model and different from Kusmi's Tea and Press Tea.

I would come here just because of service and free AC.  If you want a strong cup of tea at a different price point, you can go elsewhere."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2017-04-10,5.0,I came here yesterday early evening and had a wonderful time. The staff here is some of the friendliest I've ever encountered - the young man from last night in particular. He encouraged me to try all the samples he made and let me smell all the interesting and fun teas like birthday cake and banana nut bread. I ended up picking one of the new summer teas and it was delicious!
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2018-05-14,4.0,The amount of teas to choose from is a little overwhelming but I have tried several and enjoyed all of them. It is definitely similar to Teavana but I think this chain does a better job of being casual and affordable. There are some pretty crazy tea blends but I love the nut teas: Forever Nuts and Midsummer Night's Dream.
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2015-06-17,5.0,"HOW HAVE I NEVER WALKED INTO THIS GEM BEFORE! My mom's apartment is just down the street but I only just found this place and needless to say *in Schwarzenegger voice* I will be back.

The best part about this place is how friendly the staff is. When I walked in the two lovely ladies at the counter, both about my age, offered me iced tea samples (a lovely coconut/strawberry flavor and something peach black) and then led me through the tea selection process all while inquiring about my day. One of the staff even complimented my tattoo and took a photo of it to show her friend- too sweet. I chose my tea fairly quickly- a sweet fruity black tea- and chatted with the staff while it brewed. 

I wanted to buy everything in the store (and I probably will online.) They had a see-thru glass mug with bicycles on it with a built-in steeper and lid- obviously I need that. The tea itself wasn't too expensive- only $4.50. And so good! I also bought some agave for $8.50. I can't wait to try some more flavors and bring some home."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2014-09-25,5.0,"Really like David's Tea and discovered it in Toronto a few years ago.
As I had been to the other NYC locations, I stopped by this one yesterday by accident.
Like other David's Tea shops, great variety of teas including new Autumn specials.
One of the workers, Travis, helped me by answering so many questions about tea (he's the Wikipedia of tea information). He was extremely helpful about their product line and went above and beyond regarding  customer service. I left with a great assortment of teas to take home/to work as well as an iced Mango Lassi Latte to go---yes latte style and a must try!!!"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2018-11-10,5.0,Never was a tea drinker until I tried Davidstea! This store is so cute and there are so many flavors to try ! Everyone working was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable about all the different types of tea and flavors.
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2018-04-17,5.0,"For a sweet and tropical, summer tea... try the Pura Vida  Super sweet staff especially for a first timer. Very knowledgeable on the assortment of teas on sale. Very clean and tidy inside. Will definitely be coming back!"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2014-08-28,5.0,"I love this location. 

There is a small seating area in the back, and a clean bathroom in the case you need one.

Their product is of the highest quality, and their seasonal offerings keep the rotation fresh. The products can speak better for themselves than I can.

The stars are for the location. The staff takes pride in their product and service. The service and care is always top notch, and everyone in the store are as genuinely friendly as can be."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2016-08-15,4.0,"Over the past few years, I had been a loyal customer of Harney & Sons - But lately the quality of their loose tea had started to decline. The boyfriend had been recommending David's Tea for months and he finally took me on a trip to their store last weekend. Incredible selection of teas and amazing customer service! They have lots of sleek and vibrant-colored tea accessories available on the shelves, as well. If you walk in unsure, they really help you out with choosing flavors that would suit your palate. I walked out with several ounces of different unique teas to refill my cabinet with and freshly steeped iced tea to-go!"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2014-06-18,5.0,"David's Tea is like walking into the M&M store at Times Square and your mom telling you that you can only pick ONE color from the wall of M&Ms. From Roiboos and Mate to Green and Black and all of the in-betweens, David's Tea has an entire wall filled with ever-changing possibilities. 

Never felt so overwhelmed in all of your life? Never fear! The ""Tea-ristas"" can walk you through each section of the wall and provide smell tests on any canister you want to find the perfect steep for you. Don't know what you're in the mood for? Simply give them your requirements (caffeine, fruity, cinnamon, etc) and they will find the perfect one to match your cravings. You will be remiss if you don't try their new ""pop"" sensation that features your tea in carbonated water. Not even an ice cold beer is more refreshing. Some of my favorites over the years have been Pink Flamingo, Santa's Helper, Just Peachy, Green and Fruity and Mango Fruit Punch (yes, I stick to the right side of the wall). The best part is, a cup of tea is around $4!

They also sell a variety of tea mugs, pitchers, tea sets, so if you're looking for the perfect gift for someone, look no further. Make sure to join the frequent steeper program to get discounts and free teas. Truly my favorite place to stop for a drink in the city!"
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2016-09-11,5.0,"If you're reading this and you haven't been to David's Tea yet, you have to go. This company is the best. The staff is always friendly and helpful-- I swear David's has the best customer service of any company that I've ever interacted with. And in each of their stores, including this one, you can buy a cup of tea to go, or buy loose-leaf tea and accessories to take home. And the best part? It's not that expensive! Forget Teavana or other pretentious tea shops that overcharge you. David's gives you great quality loose-leaf tea at reasonable prices. 

I should add that I'm a total tea snob, and this is my favorite tea company, so that is really saying something. Now I pretty much only buy my tea from David's, and I drink about 2-3 cups of tea per day. They have every variety you could want-- black, green, oolong, herbal, mate, white, rooibos. Straight teas, flavored teas, everything. They always have samples available, and they'll let you smell each tea before you buy it, so you get a sense of what it will taste like. Not only is David's great for tea lovers, I've also found that it's the perfect way to introduce loose-leaf tea to people who don't drink tea regularly. Once I got hooked on David's, I introduced it to my boyfriend, best friend, roommate, and mom. Now everyone loves it. They also have fun sets and packages that make great gifts. You really can't go wrong here."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2014-10-17,5.0,"I always enjoy my time spent here, it's like a museum for the olfactory senses, everytime I come I ask the Tearista of the day to recommend some teas and I spend some time enjoying the smell. I can't say I have a favorite tea yet, they're all great. 

Also, for all those who wish to jump on the Fall bandwagon, definitely try the pumpkin chai latte! I had mine made with soymilk and a dab of agave. What was amazing to me was that the soymilk they used tasted like regular milk in a latte, and that the latte actually allowed you to taste the tea rather than most pumpkin chai lattes that really just taste like sugar. Great lowfat, lowcal pumpkin chai. I love how agave and soymilk doesn't cost extra (and it never should)."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2014-10-07,3.0,"Bamboozol! I bought a cup of this tea and it was refreshing. There are so many options! I usually don't buy cups of tea and brew it myself because it's not worth it. 

They sell tea pots and such that goes on sale! 

They also have a free membership card for some perks. 

I buy my green tea matcha from here and it's fabulous! It's not like the Starbucks matcha because there's no sugar. This is great for people that lives natural products."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2019-02-22,5.0,"Genuinely thought this place was overrated, would walk by all the time and never give it a second thought despite being a tea addict. Walked in last month and bought two loose teas from the sale on a whim and fell in love! Came back the same week and left with like 8 different teas. Honestly, they've all been great. Give it a try if you've been curious, would definitely recommend. Though, I came back a third time just to order a tea in house and asked the barista which were their most sold teas. She recommended ""forever nuts"" and I really didn't like it despite the goooregous scent bouquet, and having high hopes from my last few purchases, but it just tasted like weird nut soaked water. Also I bought a thermos from them and when I got home I found it was dented so I was a little disappointed but it's not a huge deal breaker, just wish they took defective merchandise off the shelf. Tried to exchange it but an employee told me he couldn't accept it since it hadn't been cleaned, which I get. Oh well, I still use it every day, works just fine. When I run out of my new tea horde (which will definitely be soon considering how fast I'm burning through it, they're that good) I'll be back to get more flavors. Store is really clean and has a little seating area at the back."
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2017-12-11,5.0,I love DAVIDsTEA! I always stop in for their Vanilla Matcha Latte with soy milk & it never seems to disappoint. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and so friendly!
976,davidstea-new-york-7,2016-07-03,5.0,I love David's tea! I just ordered the iced caramel corn tea with soy milk and it's really like caramel corn without the sugary calories! They have your typical regular teas which are really good too but nothing can beat the dessert teas!

977,ocd-cafe-new-york,2019-12-12,5.0,"Perfect balance of crispy, buttery pastry with a generous amount of filling inside. What else can you ask for in an empanada? The cafe has a variety of sweet and savory options, as well as illy coffee and different desserts.

THEY HAD ALFAJORES!!! When my last alfajore joint stopped making them, I gave up on these sweet delectable treats in the afternoon. I'm glad I have found my new go-to afternoon snack spot near the office! The buttery shortbread cookie sandwich enveloping sweet, caramelized dulce de leche, topped off with shredded coconut on the outside is a flavor-popping bite of yum!

I got the seafood empanada as I was craving savory - it is a shrimp and imitation crab combo. I would give this a 4-star for the texture of the shrimp - it was a bit overcooked and overly chewy-spongy. However, the crust was excellent and crisp, and the empanada was nice and warm. Maybe because I went at 4p, it was in the warmer too long?

However, the green olive oil-based sauce definitely took the whole thing to another level. It brings a new dimension of flavor, some slightly spicy notes of onion/jalapeño, a bit of lime-y sour, fresh and crisp cilantro, and that creamy fattiness from the oil. Huge tastebud explosion!

Going to try the Oxtail tomorrow (includes sweet plantains), maybe another beef one as well, and that interesting ""Blue Diamond"" latte that a regular was inside ordering when I stopped by. Alex was the barista in the afternoon who was really funny and nice.


--
If only you can check in twice in a day! Got lunch and tried the oxtail with plantains - nice sweet element added to the savory shredded beef, with fried exterior. Also tried a baked beef (wanted to try a non-fried one). Again, the green sauce is what does it! Super filling, too! Got to meet Diana, the mother, who is super welcoming.

Came back a second time to get that blue drink - it's a blue pea flower tea latte with lavender syrup. Nice and light after the empanadas. Got it with the oat milk!"
977,ocd-cafe-new-york,2019-10-10,4.0,"OCD, they get the job done. Great no-nonsense spot to grab a coffee and a macaron on your way out of the subway.

I definitely prefer the green. Try the steak, egg, and cheese empanada. Your breakfast game just got elevated.  I wont judge when you try to figure out how to fit your tongue into the little green sauce cup to get the last drop. As I said in the beginning-the people who run this are so personable, secret, and patient while keeping this running as efficiently as they can.

Eggplant empanadas, creme brûlée and the finest coffees you can find this side of Columbia, South America. Run don't walk to this food treasure. Excellent service and reasonable prices. This place is great"

977,ocd-cafe-new-york,2018-10-11,5.0,"This place is down the stairs heading into the subway station and has the most amazing empanadas I've had. My wife and I got the brazil empanada (ground beef, olives sauteed onions and potatoes) every morning while we were staying there. I'm literally still salivating thinking about them more than two weeks later. I'd love to see breakfast empanadas become a thing."
977,ocd-cafe-new-york,2019-06-17,5.0,"Clean. Delicious. Their green ""guacamole"" sauce was outstanding! They were very nice as well! Definitely recommend."
977,ocd-cafe-new-york,2018-09-09,5.0,"A true joy!!  I stumbled across this tucked-away gem as I was on my way to a medical appt in midtown.  It's located literally underground on a platform of a staircase that leads to the Orange-lettered subways in Rockefeller Center (47th Street entrance/exit). The teenie weenie eatery is located next to a deli-type/bodega store.  Located in a subway??  So small, barely room to walk in or walk out??  I thought it odd, walked by it at least 10 times, and didn't give it a second glance - until I did.  And I'm so glad I did.  

This place is amazing. I was drawn in by the sign outside the store that advertises baked empanadas.  Who doesn't love a tasty turnover?? And baked to boot?  It was clearly my lucky day. 

On my first visit I had a spinach empanada. I had walked in for a chicken one, but that particular day, the empanadas were fried, except for the spinach version. Maybe it wasn't my lucky day.  But one of the friendly store owners, Alex, was super apologetic and did his best to help me find something that would make me happy. So I walked out with a spinach empanada and a tiramisu.  

It was indeed my lucky day. Both were delish!!! The empanada was packed to the brim with a creamy and tangy spinach/feta filling. The complimentary (cilantro?) sauce was the icing on the proverbial cake.  Already yummy, it elevated the empanada to another level, full of flavor and umami.  The tiramisu was the perfect balance of sponge cake and smooth and creamy whipped topping, with the requisite coffee note riding in the background. 

I was immediately a fan and couldn't wait till my next medical appt so I would have  the opportunity to visit and taste their delicious vittles. 

Two days later, I went back and I was not disappointed.  The chicken empanada was filled with pure shredded chicken, no cheap fillers. Their green sauce complimented the chicken even better then it did the spinach empanada. They didn't have the tiramisu that day, yet again, Alex was not going to let me walk away unhappy. I left with a warmed, ooey gooey chocolate cookie that was light, airy, fudge-like on the inside and crispy to the bite on the outside. The occasional crunch from a hidden nut would delight my palate with unfettered pleasure.  

It pains me that I have to wait a whole week before I have the chance to visit this golden gem again. I'm excited about getting the opportunity to taste their other empanada flavors.  As Alex was citing the ingredients and sharing some of his favorite specialty foods and drinks to make, I discovered that all their food is homemade and clearly made with love. No wonder it was all so tasty. 

If you find yourself riding any of the Orange lines, it's worth it to take a small detour to head to this eatery of deliciousness and love.  Neither the food or the hospitality will disappoint."
977,ocd-cafe-new-york,2018-04-30,5.0,"The underground coffee shop run by a lovely family - I always come here when I get tired, or just for busy morning. They have everything that is what we expect for coffee shop with more reasonable pricing, and plus, empanadas, pastries, macarons. I usually get americano and biscotti.  
They recently started breakfast burritos which are really good and filing. 
They also added some deserts like creme brulee etc. They use real chocolate for hot chocolate and mocha so it's worth trying. Anyway I really recommend visiting this heart warming place especially you are working around here."
977,ocd-cafe-new-york,2019-07-19,5.0,"This is my favorite little place to grab coffee when I'm in the Rockefeller Center area.  They are the liveliest people even bright and early in the morning.  You can tell that you matter to them.  I used to pass by this cafe when I was in a rush coming up from the subway, but now I always stop by.  Decent coffee and pastries to start the morning.  This is one of those little gems that make New York City feel like home."

In any event, as with all weekday mornings, I crawled out of the B/D/F/M catacombs (late for work, although this time the fault being wholly my own, NOT the MTA ::gasps::) - generally questioning my life choices, wash rinse repeat...

Then, like a bolt of midtown copyrighting with hints of rich caffeinated ecstasy from the holy heavens above, I stumbled on the aptly named OCD. 

A perfect match for my adult ADHD, I think. Nu?

Amazingly delicious fruit empanada, tasty cold brew and smiles. Genuine smiles. All during AM rush hour. Worth. Every. Penny. 5 stars!

977,ocd-cafe-new-york,2017-05-18,5.0,"Ordered the white mocha latte and it was everything you would hope for in one. Would highly recommend getting the whipped cream on it because it's homemade and much tastier and creamier than normal spray can whipped cream.

Also to get here, you have to go down in to the 47th St. entrance of the BDFM subway stop and go up the first set of stairs towards the exit on the east side of the station."
977,ocd-cafe-new-york,2018-03-01,5.0,"Wow... what a hidden gem, one landing down the subway steps at the SE corner of 46th and 6th.  Myself and two coworkers ordered 9 empanadas total, and literally each one looked, felt, and tasted like a labor of love, stuffed to the brim with filling and perfectly encapsulated with a flaky crust.  There were no second-class citizens.  As evidence of their creativity and craft, the ""Cheese Steak"" was entirely different from the generic shaved steak and cheese we had imagined, and turned out to be an incredible combination of uniquely-seasoned, cubed peppersteak and savory cheese.  Beyond the empanadas, the owners' hospitality was genuine and refreshing, as if we stepped for a few minutes into their home.  Thank you, OCD!  Try the green sauce, and try the fruit-based ones for dessert!"

978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2019-11-26,1.0,"Honestly should just stop going here.  They're ridiculously sneaky and multiple times I've noticed they hid the sign behind a cup that informs the customer there is an extra charge if they pay by credit card. And today, they charged me assuming I'll pay by card and it was only until I took out cash that they told me a lowered price. I get that it's just cents, but that adds up, and a shady business should not get to take advantage of customers who are already paying at least $5 for a latte with non dairy alternative.

11/26 - Editing to update my remarks based on their below response:

Yes, I reached out directly to them to point out the unsatisfactory experience after I discovered that the cup wasn't even full esp for what I paid for. I wrote the review and then I decided to reach out as well. Please don't try to exaggerate and make it seem as though I was dropping f bombs when I e-mailed DIRECTLY to resolve this. I literally only used the word ""crap"" ONCE and that was directed at the coffee and NOT at any person whatsoever. While I appreciate the gesture, it seems as though you think that refund should negate or prevent any future negative feedback simply because you felt that ""the hospitable thing"" was more than sufficient since ""normally this would not be grounds for a refund.""

If this is something you ""intentionally"" do, then maybe check with other actual coffee shops in the city because I've never once seen a coffee shop that leaves THAT much room to prevent spillage. Let's not even talk about the fact that you don't even have those cardboard cup sleeves and I have to use a whole wad of napkins every time just to carry it back. All I see are lids and napkins on the counter so please don't pull some ""well you can ask for it"" because again, I've never had to ask ANY coffee shop to please provide a sleeve to hold my hot beverage. Where's your shop's measure in that to prevent a ""potential burn""? Doesn't seem much like ""erring on the side of caution"", no?

So I guess both times there just so happened to conveniently be a travel mug blocking the sign. If this was the case, how about informing your employees to make sure it's placed back to the spot where customers would KNOW that there's a discount then if cash is used. Because by the way you described it, if it's a discount that all customers are invited and encouraged to take advantage of, then wouldn't you want to have that sign be out in the open? I highly doubt customers would even be aware of this ""wonderful discount"" since you have a whole bunch of stock items blocking the sign continuously.

Yes, it was $5 for a MEDIUM LATTE with a non dairy alternative. Your cup is smaller than other boutique AND chain stores (as clearly referenced in various reviews on here by others) and the price ends up being more. Have you even thoroughly done your research?

I never took some secret sip out of any beverage so the fact you're actually accusing me of DRINKING the latte before even taking a picture? Yeah, I'm sure my lying and exaggerated claims were what got me nominated to Elite status for the past 5 years. That photo you are referring to was after walking multiple blocks and since you so cautiously leave the cup unfilled to prevent potential burns, that's what going to happen and how the cup is going to look like after walking several blocks. It's going to slosh around and me removing the lid will lead to that.

If you can't even take a critique saying that your business practices seem off, then maybe you shouldn't be in the business in the first place. I provided genuine concern and remarks based on my MULTIPLE experiences and you're using your response to essentially slander my character and insinuate I made up false complaints. As a customer, I would say that you're the party that's out of line by issuing the type of response you did."

978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2018-03-08,5.0,"The staff at Ninth Street Espresso are very friendly and helpful. I came here for their espresso beans because we like to make our own latte in the morning. 
I was greeted by the barista behind the bar as soon as I walked in on a rainy, cold, dark Friday evening. I was checking out their beans and he was paying attention in case I had any questions. And of course I did. He answered politely. I proceeded to pay for the beans. He offered me a complimentary cup of drip coffee brewed with the same beans I purchased and told me where the milk/sugar area is located. 
I didn't expect this kind of customer service from a coffee shop to be perfectly honest. In fact, I've been to a lot of hipster cafes that the staff could be quite snobby. 
I was pleasantly surprised here. 

Finally the coffee -- the brew coffee was a bit too strong for me in the evening. The flavor profile was good and if you like the coffee that is little on the sour side, this is the one for you. 
The espresso bean I got was good too. We got it once before. We are definitely recurring customers!"

When you Think coffee shop you think a place to sit down and get your work done while sipping a cup coffee. This was not one of those places. The tables were dirty, furniture is very minimal, and the workers are super loud and rowdy that no one can hear anything but them. One man came in and commented on the level of noise and one of the workers just replied, ""it's a free show,"" which annoyed me because there's a place to hang out and there's a place to work. You're not hanging out with your friends at a zoo. Zero work etiquette but maybe that's just me. 

The two stars are for decent pastry, and a strong cortado."

Great tasting espressos for a fair price. Definitely worth a visit :)

Value: I got the 9oz espresso with milk for $4 which was more than fair given the taste and amount.

Experience: The line moved quickly and servers were friendly. I wished there were seats that faced each other though. There were only counters along the wall to sit/stand at.

Taste: The espresso was fantastic! The milk made it rich and the overall drink was smooth. The espresso was the perfect temperature and extremely pleasant. One of the best espressos I've had in the city!"
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2018-05-01,5.0,"My favorite coffee shop in NYC! The iced latte is so delicious.

First the cold brew was bold and had a great velvety creamy texture with a hint of caramel. Second, the brew had a richness to it with just enough caffeine that made me quite euphoric. I'm a morning person so when I get a great tasting coffee, with a punch, it makes my day. 

Great coffee here."

Or you won't be going to 7th Heaven of caffeine... it will be more like 6 ft under. No but seriously.. watch your step when you come in. 

 All kidding aside this location is not on Ninth Street. This coffee shop is a local New York chain that began on 10th street. A chain where every location does not look the same. These chains are more like siblings. You have the foodie sis in Chelsea Market, the artsy beer lover in Gowanus and this is the smart, attorney older brother in Midtown East.

Aside  from it's look you are still getting the same delicious and creamy lattes you would get in every location. I can always depend on Ninth Street to meet my high expectations. They also have gorgeous merch. I have their tattoo inspired thermos and I love it! And I get compliments allll the time on it. And it never spills in my purse...knock on wood. They also have a number of tasty baked morsels to pick from. I have been know to enjoy a treat and coffee and skedaddle back to work."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2016-07-28,4.0,"Like everyone has stated, the menu is small. Which I like. For the coffee lovers who like theirs black with no cream and sugar, like me, you have a good spot you'll have to stop by. 

Friendly and smiley staff. When I stopped by in the morning, it was t crowded but it was all business men in their suites that were there. So it's more like a get-your-coffee-and-go type of place. There are seating areas too but not like a table and let's catch up with friends type of place. 

Maybe I'm blind but I didn't find a sleeve for the to-go coffee cups. I like my coffee super hot so I love how they serve it like that BUT my hands were burning trying to hold the cup while walking from the shop to work.lol.

978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2017-01-25,5.0,"Ninth Street Espresso has multiple locations. I have only tried the one at the Lombardy Hotel in Midtown East. I have been here many times and yet to be disappointed. The taste and latte arts of the drinks are always top notch.

978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2017-02-06,4.0,"Another great place to study. The music is low and melodic, the counters are wide and deep, and if you have had too much espresso (they serve all drinks as double shots) the barista won't think it's weird if you ask for a cup of just milk. 

Some peculiarities: 
-cash only 
-espresso shots in multiples of two.....?! 
-""the only drink flavoring is mocha"" (no chai lattes, for example)"
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2017-12-15,4.0,"They take credit card! I was ecstatic to find out this coffee shop has oat milk (+$0.50)! Got the ""cold coffee"", which was great. Not a lot of seating but definitely a cool quiet space. No frills coffee, you won't get your frappuccinos here. Great for coffee lovers."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2017-02-24,3.0,"This is a cafe house for the busy people. They are quick and all the seating they offer is a bar style chairs. So it's not intended for lengthy stays and meetings. 

The coffee drink I had ( cappuccino) tasted very good and they topped it off with a nice foam art. It was $4. So not bad for New York. 

The service was good and the person behind the bar was nice and courteous. 

The place overall is clean. 

The only reason I did not give them 4 stars was due to the fact to their very limitted food options. It makes sense if they intentionally want to be only a cafe, but I would think some basic breakfast or light meals might come handy to many on the run."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2018-08-07,1.0,The staff was nice and friendly but my iced DECAF mocha was not decaf. I'm 8 1/2 months pregnant and stressed twice to make sure my drink is decaf.

Needed a break.
Yelped out a near by lunch spot and cafe for afters.

Went, guided by the high stars.

What? Where? Why?

I remember this cafe from a million years ago.
The floor. Reminded me of NYC back in the day. Way back. Like Frank Sinatra was still alive, back.

The space is large, lots of open floor and lost space. Making it feel a bit like a bus station. But the black and white diamond floor and view to the street, makes me feel that Marilyn might show up if I just wait a minute. Or, better yet, Don Drapers wife.

The coffee?
Average.
Didn't match my imagination.

Good for a quick buzz and hide away from the maddening crowds."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2017-11-12,4.0,Don't let this unassuming store front stop you from walking into an incredibly modern and elegant coffee shop. We both got cappuccinos and they had a great bitter taste. Would definitely come again!
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2016-02-22,5.0,"Dangerously close to work, pleasantly Italian. While you can have it to go and in different sizes, the cappuccino at Ninth Street Espresso is the real deal, quite possibly better than the original, in that they really take their time to whip it up. Or foam it up. Also relevant that different baristas manage to keep the quality and texture consistent, which I think that's where many other coffee places struggle with. But please, take it ""to stay, and small"".
The sweets are intriguing and well presented, although I found some to be overly, well,  sweet. The banana chocolate bread is different than the usual and it has that ""baked at home"" feel, which depending on your prowess with the oven might be a scary proposition. In that scenario, the coconut sandwich with chocolate filling is the perfect, unorthodox dipping candidate. It works, all the time.

Ninth Street Espresso does not like your credit cards, so don't even try to swipe one. They also don't want you to seat comfortably, as coffee should be served ""by the bar"", as they have it in Italy. The couple of stools do the job, but a larger group won't be happy. Overall, too good a cappuccino to get bothered by menial back ache and the inevitable coin counting routine."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2016-07-30,4.0,"Solid intense coffee.

Service was what turned me off and the ambiance. It was really pretentious and cold. The service was poor and just not welcoming. There is no seating, just uncomfortable high metal bar stools. If you just quickly want good coffee then this is the place. They only have 5 drinks so dont try to get fancy with some vanilla chai latte. This place does coffee."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2017-05-07,4.0,"Get it and go cafe. A large space but not that much for seating, it seems its more accommodating for lines. No frills coffee, so nothing special but what they do have is basic and good. Definitely wasn't crowded when I was there in the afternoon but I can see it being a spot for professionals in the area to stop by."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2018-05-12,4.0,"I really enjoy Ninth Street Espresso.  This location is unique from the others, because it's inside a hotel. Although, you can enter without going inside the hotel.  If you need to use the bathroom, then you must go into the hotel. They don't have too many pastry offerings.  But, their coffee is top notch.  Their bastristas are very pleasant,"
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2015-11-22,4.0,"Tasty espresso. But I can't believe they're cash-only![1]

This Ninth Street Espresso is connected to a swanky hotel, and a swanky bathroom. It has a vintage feel, and offers light seating.

Mornings, expect a crowd. This spot gets foot traffic, no surprise since they're a quality espresso bar. Friendly service.

Find them a short jaunt from Grand Central.

[1] I still can't believe they're cash-only, especially considering the location and the fact that it's 2015."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2016-04-05,3.0,"Small menu but they can make unlisted drinks like Americano if you ask for it.

We ordered an Americano (not on the menu) and a latte (or as they called it, espresso with milk). We hoped that our drinks would come in mugs, but the barista served it in to-go cups instead.

The inside could probably fit 10-15? people but only had like 6 bar stools.

Our drinks were OK. We had a chocolate croissant and liked it! The chocolate chip cookie was just average. We're not sure if they make their own food or get it from somewhere else.

Overall very expensive drinks, including the pastries for just slightly above mediocre taste. This place functions more as a grab-and-go place rather than a sit-down cafe. I hope for a better experience on another visit."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2015-12-28,4.0,"It's been over a year since my last review and during that time I've been to most the local cafes in the area:
Birch
Ground Terminal (La Colombe)
Bustlier
Brooklyn Diamond Coffee (La Colombe)
Capital One 360 (Peets)
Juan Valdez Cafe
Bluestone Lane (Sightline)
Gregorys Coffee
Demarco
Fika
Pomme Palais (Illy)
As a fan of 3rd wave coffee, this cafe ranks among the top (with Little Collins, Blue Bottle, Cafe Grumpy, and Pennylane) in Midtown East.

The high quality of their dip solid and consistent with the nutty, citrus notes of their Alphabet City Brazilian beans brings me there every work day.

While they don't change their bean (except for a Nicaraguan bean they sell retail), what they sell is top notch. It's unfortunate that ppl claim the above listed cafes have ""great coffee"" when most are programmed with the dark burnt taste from Starbucks. I'm thankful for a great cafe like this."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2015-10-31,5.0,"Came here after my food god, Alton Brown said this is the best coffee in NY, he's always right! They don't have many choices but it's because they know how to do their coffee right! I got a simple expresso with milk to go. It truly was the best coffee I've had, very rich and flavorful! They have a few different locations though out the city. On my next visit to NY this is going to be my go to first place to revisit! 
Only bad thing, is its cash only. Hit up the ATM before arriving!"
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2016-04-29,2.0,"It's an OK place but it has really bad coffee. Didn't like it at all. It lacks body and flavor.
I ordered an americano and honestly it was like flavored water.
Also, a very small size coffee for $3. I wouldn't recommend it because I won't go back.
The staff is nice though..."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2016-07-14,5.0,"It's hard to balance relaxed and chic, but they blend perfectly here. The simple menu is justified with a rich multinodal espresso that plays on your palate. The interior is just the sort of flavor where you want to stay and hang out for a bit."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2017-12-14,5.0,"The espresso with steamed milk (6 oz's) earns 5 Stars alone.

978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2016-05-28,3.0,"Ninth Street Espresso is situated right next door to the Lombardy and is a walkable distance from the Lexington Ave / 59th St station. It is also connected to the hotel from the lobby if you go past the steakhouse and the salon. 

I had the pleasure to visit during a weekend trip to the city and my stay at the hotel gave out complimentary breakfast vouchers for coffee and a pastry. The shop offers a limited selection, which works in their favor of specializing in select pastries. The case held croissants, mufffins, and danishes. Hot and iced coffees/teas with self help to the milk, creamers, sugar, and a few other things. 

Having tried the iced coffee, raspberry muffin, and plain croissant, the clear winner in the mix was the muffin! It was moist and minimally sweet, with the flavor of tart raspberries. The croissant was not as flaky to my liking and no offer was made to toast it or warm it up a bit. As for the coffee, as I usually like mine iced and black, I did not favor the taste of it here and had to add milk in it. Not sure why it didn't have a stronger coffee taste but the milk made it better. 

Not many people were there on a Sunday morning around 930am but it is kind of in a quiet area with less foot traffic."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2017-08-27,3.0,"Came here on a whim exploring coffee shops in the area, as many other said the store is pretty standard. Very friendly staff who are easy to chat with. Overall the cappuccino and macchiatos we ordered we made exactly as expected but the espresso itself wasn't good. We ended up also ordering a coffee and it was sub par. 

Overall great staff, quick service but underwhelming product."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2013-07-25,5.0,"When I moved out of the East Village, I knew there were many things I would not miss: the crusties, the college kids running rampant at 3am on weekday nights, the rats.  But there was one thing that I would definitely miss and that was espresso.  They have some of the best espresso places in the East Village - one of my favorites being Ninth Street Espresso.

One day while walking to work down 56th Street, I saw the sign for Ninth Street Espresso.  This can't be THE Ninth Street Espresso, I thought.  So I tried it out this morning.  It was pretty quiet inside, but I don't think this location has been open for very long.  I ordered the 9 oz. espresso with milk which was about $4.00.  Pretty pricey and cash only, but once I took a sip I realized why.  I had forgotten what great espresso tasted like.  Smooth, strong, and simply amazing. The baristas were very friendly and helpful.  The pastries looked pretty yummy as well.  Now I'm bouncing off the walls writing this review.  I am officially hooked."
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2019-02-08,3.0,4.5 stars for the coffee but almost nothing to serve with it. It would be nice if they cleaned the filthy windows that line one wall of the store and the bird crap covered doorway. 56th between Park and Lexington is not Alphabet City. I'll go to Little Collins around the corner when in the area. They have good coffee too and seem to appreciate their customers enough to clean the place.
978,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-8,2016-02-09,4.0,"Very simple expresso bar that serves quality drinks by experienced individuals. Only downside they accept cash only and have no wifi.

Even though I moved, I find myself back here when I am in the neighborhood and getting my usual bologna sandwich. I have tried other places but this place really packs it with the meat."
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2019-07-24,1.0,"The staff making sandwiches often make customers trying to order wait for long periods of time for no apparent reason. 

There is often a line of customers waiting to order, and the staff will make them wait- as they arrange the cheese, or stack the tomatoes... literally anything else other than taking your order. Not sure why they are stalling... but as a customer waiting to order it's uncomfortable to just stand there and wonder why they aren't asking you for your order... as you watch them pointlessly count slices of Gouda. 

While I typically love to support local businesses, it's tough to do so when the store acts as though it doesn't want or need your business. 

Do yourself a favor, there is a Guy and Gallard shop across the street - they are swift to help and take your order."
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2018-07-13,4.0,"They have just about everything you could ever need as far as food goes. I have seen tourists from the hotel next door buying all their groceries here, obviously they were not quite understanding that they were paying the highest prices, but its convenience.

The paninis are great as are the wraps and all the deli food is super fresh. I get the Tuscany Panini at least once a week."
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2017-05-16,5.0,"I always come here every time I need to get flowers. Their flowers are always fresh and the prices are reasonable, sometimes even cheaper than buying it from Queens. My most important thing is that the flowers last long and open nicely. This place never disappoints. 

If you need to combine some bouquets and make a larger one, you need to pick it, go inside to pay for it, take your receipt and show it to the guy outside so he can take apart the bouquets and put it together nicely for you.

My mother's day bouquet costed $25 and I was thoroughly satisfied with my purchase. The bouquet was actually $15 and I added 2 bouquets of pink mini carnations which are my mom's favorite ($5 each)."

979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2017-05-25,4.0,"MHM is an incredible local market if you live in the area. I used to make great use of it all the time during my Murray Hill days.

First of all, the deal on salads is great. You get 6 toppings, up to 2 of any given selection. Sometimes they'll let you get only 2 servings of meat, but other times you can get as many as 6. This all rings up to less than $10.

There's a great drink selection, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, in addition to fresh fruit and veggies, baking materials, cereal, yogurt, cookies, crackers, chocolate...you get the point. You can even buy individual Ferrero Rocher truffles, sometimes Reese's, and things like that. They actually have a pretty good selection of flowers at reasonable prices too.

They make a mean BEC and pesto chicken wrap. Some of the employees don't speak the best English, but I've never had a problem with the language barrier. Once they get to know you, they'll know your ""usual"". They take orders over the phone which is something I'd recommend considering during busy hours.

One complaint: sometimes they, seemingly arbitrarily, refuse to deliver even if I'm a block or two away (I know, I know...I should stop being so lazy and just go get it, but this episode of The Americans is so good and I'm comfortable in my pajamas).

For a no frills, local market open 24 hours a day, this place has great prices and a great variety. I'd by no means go out of my way to make it here, but if you live in the area, this should be a staple."

979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2016-03-05,1.0,"I used to love going to the Murray hill market, but had an awful experience this morning. I ordered a Greek omelette platter from Louis. He said ""we don't have anymore home fries"", to which I asked ""is there anything I can get instead?"" His response: ""no, it's past 11 lady. If you want the platter get here earlier"". Ok...

So I get to the register to pay and I check my order, which is literally just egg whites and onion (what I had asked for as an add on to the Greek omelette). I told the woman at the register that this isn't what I ordered (I had already paid). They told me to go back to the counter and ask them to remake it.

Louis started yelling at me that I ordered egg whites and onion and that he wouldn't remake it for me. After telling him that I know what I said, he told me I don't know what I said (sexist much?). While all of this was going on he was treating the men around me with the upmost respect and calling them ""sir"" etc.

I go back to the register and ask for a refund since Louis refused to correct my order. The helpful women at the register asked me to write my order down, and went over and told him to remake it. What does Louis do? He literally started swearing and calling me a ""puta"" under his breath as he walked to the back and refused to make it for me. He left his coworker at the counter to handle a long line of customers. However, his coworker made me my omelette.

I asked the women at the register who the manager is and when he'll be back (Monday). And I told them ""thank you for being helpful, I know this isn't your fault. This is just crazy to me- I've never seen or heard of customers being treated like this"". When I finally got my order, Louis proceeded to yell at me to ""come back on Monday I don't care"".  

Needless to say, I will not be returning here and will tell anyone who will listen about this appalling experience.

Bought a box of cereal and found a bunch bugs in the box. Not even in the cereal bag, because then I would probably from the manufacturer, but this was clearly because this box of cereal has been sitting on the shelf for so long. 

When we went back to request a refund and notify the manager that she should probably remove the rest of boxes she completely denied that its their problem and it came like that. I find that very hard to believe. Picture is posted unless the owners have taken it down.

Regardless there is nothing else that would keep me coming back to this place. Their prepared food looks like its been there for awhile and a lot of their salad toppings come from a can."

979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2014-08-15,3.0,"This is my regular lunch spot because it's convenient, fast, and the deli sandwiches are always great. They make the sandwiches really quickly and the deli guys are pretty friendly for a busy Midtown spot. 

I got a salad today though and was not impressed at all. $7.50 for a large salad seemed reasonable but there was barely any lettuce in it. Maybe they're trying to leave room for the 6 free toppings you get (pretty generous servings) but the grilled chicken and apples I had in my salad did not taste fresh at all. Chicken tasted like it had been sitting out overnight. 

Still my favorite Midtown place for cheap sandwiches though!"
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2015-07-18,4.0,"I've had a few different food items from here and they are all good.

First off, their coffee is really good and always freshly made. I actually enjoy their coffee better than any franchise coffee places.

Their bagels are really good bagels. They are always fresh tasting. Their scallion cream cheese is good but has a little too many onions and has an overwhelming smell and taste.

Their chopped salads are surprisingly good! The Italian dressing is very good, and the chicken they use is juicy. The ingredients they mix in ( like broccoli, carrots, cucumbers, etc) are fresh and crunchy.

I've also gotten the chicken salad from here which is pretty good, a little heavy on the mayo. 


Overall, good place to get a quick food item. The owners are nice as well!"
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2018-10-06,1.0,"if i can give this deli a negative number i definitely want would. im a loyal customer i purchase food from them all the time, im a supervisor up the block and i've always loves their food however today i decided to try something new im pregnant and i've been craving all kinds of foods. i ordered a chicken teriyaki hero it was $7.99, i walked up the block to work after taking a bite i realized i really was not pleased with the sauce. i went back down the block to ask of they can please exchange it or refund me, the man who made the sandwich said to talk to his manager i went over kindly and spoke with him. not only was he disrespectful and rude he ignored my complaint and said he will not give me a refund nor will he exchange my sandwich. i only see them treat black people this way no other race !!!"
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2014-11-15,4.0,"Adorable Market near my sister's house. We stopped by to pick up some fresh flowers for her roommate just to thank the both of them for their hospitality. We stayed with them over the weekend plus a few days. We were super appreciative! We walked by and the flower stand outside was extremely appealing. They had a large variety! We were able to pick up a small bouquet for $5! What a steal. It wasn't like the most beautiful bunch in the bunch, but we genuinely thought it was a good deal! Pick up the bouquet and pay inside. Again it seemed like a lunch rush so the lines were kind of lengthy but people were moving fast. That's the NY way! Plenty of snacks and local groceries inside! Great if you live nearby!"
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2016-07-30,3.0,"Got the turkey club! Decent sand which, decent price and convenient. It's a deli, they have what you would find at any ol deli. 

The thing that bothered me about this place were the workers, they seemed miserable, as if they were being forced to work. Long faces, no emotion or expression. Sorta like robots, what do you want, here you go, next. Think of it as getting food from a vending machine"
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2015-04-06,1.0,The man working tonight sexually harrasses women. He always jokes about trying to take my credit card and asks me for my phone number. So inapropriate. I bought a sandwich tonight that was 6.50 and he charged me 7.57 because I ignored his advances.  I like the sandwiches but stopped going for a while because of this man. If any other women have experienced this please email me back.
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2017-05-30,1.0,Terrible customer service. Prices make no sense with regards to pricing board and staff are just so rude. Salads I'm pretty sure are made yesterday...! Go elsewhere.
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2011-04-22,4.0,"I'd like to give this place five stars but I've only had one thing here - the italian combo sandwich. Let's call it 4.6

Meat - awesome, bread - a little waxy but good, cheese - amazing, condiments - straightforward but decent

The place has a million options in the case and they all look unreal, pissed I don't live closer so I could try this place again and again. But the weather and the rent, then I got all my stuff out here and my gf - it's just, it's a hassle."
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2017-05-30,4.0,"Great place to stop in and grab a quick sandwich or soup. We found the selection better than we expected. Our children pesto panini was great and the chicken chili did not disappoint. Gorgeous flowers out front. Service not friendly but not rude either.., par for the NYC course."
979,murray-hill-market-new-york,2015-10-10,5.0,Best deli in Murray hill. The wraps are superior to anything you will find in the neighborhood.
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2020-02-08,4.0,"The decaf americano has good flavor. This
is another brand of ""designer"" and expensive coffee. That's all. 
The staff was friendly."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2019-11-08,4.0,"Generally speaking, I prefer coffeeshops where you can sit down and relax a minute.  Notsomuch the case here, unfortunately. But for a midtown work crowd it works out well. The line moves quick, and the Partners (formerly Toby's Estate) coffee is some of the best coffee in the city. 

The staff at this locations, although I've noticed it true with any of the Partners locations, is friendly, professional, and quick.  I haven't really tried many of the pastries here, but would absolutely come visit on the regular for a latte.

Small secret: 
Avoid the crowds at the rest of UrbanSpace by coming in through the passageway on the West side of Park Avenue, under the Helmsley Building.  The passageway sits directly behind the Partners coffee stand within Urbanspace, with easy-in, easy-out, and no-fuss.  Once you learn it, you won't forget it, and you'll be glad read this review."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2019-01-03,4.0,"Tip: Definitely use the Ritual app to order ahead here because it gets extremely crowded especially because it's in Urbanspace Vanderbilt next to Liquiteria. If you order through ritual you can just go to the end by their espresso machine to pick up your drink without any hassles. There is also an entrance by that end so you don't have to compete with the crowd that's entering Urbanspace from the cashier side. Expect to wait a while if you decide to stand in line to order. It can get quite cramped with the line of people ordering and the line waiting for their drinks. 

Their lemon poppyseed loaf slices and croissants are my favorites of their baked goods. The croissant is actually buttery and flaky like it's supposed to be. They offer more unique drinks like sage lavender au laits, apple cider rooibos tea, and fig rosemary lattes. You can actually order any of the teas as au laits for $0.50 extra. Also one of the few coffee/tea shops that makes jasmine tea not just green tea. They use whole, 2%, almond and oat milks for their drinks (almond and oat great for people looking for dairy alternatives). 

Their baristas and cashiers are usually quite nice."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2019-02-26,4.0,"It's expensive but it's also midtown and basically apart of grand central so.... what can ya do? 

Despite the pricing being regionally understandable. It was also worth it. 

I had the Bedford Blend 

Just one cup of Joe and it hit the spot. Def a strong bean. 

There's little treats and such (which I didn't partake) they looked good 

I like the aesthetic too. Only thing that sucks is that it's amongst a bunch of ruckus lol 

It's in a food court situation (I was aware when I yelped it) and there is like 3 seats off to the side. 

Cozy spot to do work if you can grab it. But not really (you know, cause of the ruckus)"
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2020-01-03,4.0,Very awesome little shop right by grand central. Sure beats the swill out on the streets. Good coffee. Decent croissants.
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2019-05-03,2.0,"Sooooo expensive!! A 6 oz. tiny petite nanoscopic infinitesimal cup of flat white is $4.36!! I could get double that size for the same price at Gregory's or other similar if not better cafes. The coffee beans they use are Toby's Estate, which is mediocre. Definitely ridiculous prices set here. Highly do not recommend unless you're making bank or something in the offices nearby."

980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2018-10-29,5.0,"Truly delicious almond milk cappuccino, especially adding a few drops of honey. There was a mistake at the counter (to no fault of the cafe) when somebody else took my cappuccino instead of his macchiato. The kind barista (sorry, don't remember his name) apologized and made me another, and also asked if I wanted the macchiato as well, which I brought as a pleasant surprise to my colleague. :) Excellent experience overall, tasty espresso, and I especially appreciated the cute hearts swirled on top."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2019-12-23,4.0,The seasonal peppermint mocha was lovely but I did thing the spinach turnover would be served heated..
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2019-05-19,5.0,Really enjoyed my latte :)  Very smooth. Not bitter.  Would definitely fuel up here again.
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2019-06-20,5.0,"I come here way too frequently, got stood up here, was sad, but then I made a fire playlist to boost my spirits. Good coffee and They didn't really bother me even though I sat there for a whole 3 1/2 hours for a dat who didn't show up. Also I come here every time I'm waiting for a train, either to my friend's place in Connecticut or to get back to school from an early-ass flight. 

Lattes with Oat Milk are my saviors in the early morning!"
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2017-11-27,4.0,"Pretty delicious cold brew and flat whites at Toby's. The business should create a rewards program for customers who come here religiously; thus giving regulars even more reason to love toby's. 
Toby's should also consider obtaining oat milk for their lactose customers. According to my boss, ""oat milk is the way of the future"".

Update: As of 12/6/17 they serve oat milk latte

Update #2: thanks Toby for getting oat milk latte, my boss said he'll write me a fantastic year-end review now"
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2019-10-18,2.0,"I do not recommend getting anything but their regular brewed coffee and I would only get this if you have 10-15 mins to wait on line. 

The fall special ""oat horchata"" tastes like a regular latte with oat milk in a small espresso cup, very expensive and quite disappointing."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2018-11-30,4.0,"This location (inside urbanspace) is always slammed, but it's super close to my office and the line moves pretty fast. The hot chai tea latte is great; I'll be back for the actual coffee soon."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2019-02-28,3.0,"The coffee was great. I ordered an oat milk cortado, it was perfect. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because of the atmosphere and the price. I do not like that it is in UrbanSpace. It is too crowded in there, but I guess it is a convenience factor. I paid $4.73 I believe for the cortado, but thats around normal I guess. I would not pay $3.00 for a drip coffee though... so good thing they had unsweetened oat milk (they do not have any other unsweetened other non-dairy milk)."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2018-01-22,3.0,"In UrbanSpace Vanderbilt next to Grand Central Terminal. There's a ton of food options and such if you're looking for a bite and some coffee!

This place always has a huge line in the morning. But, it moves pretty quickly. The baristas are friendly and fast. Their sizes are smaller than your typical coffee place for the same high price. 

Definitely a high caffeine content. Good quality beans but their espressos and coffee are just a bit too sour for my taste. I can see why people love it but it just wasn't right for my taste."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2018-10-10,4.0,The coffee here is really yummy and creamy! Lots of flavor. And they have a few milk options which is nice. There was one time they didn't make my coffee well and they knew it so they gave me a card for a free coffee which was really nice! One downfall is that it's pretty pricey haha. But def worth it!
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2018-08-03,2.0,"How long does it take to make a latte when there is 1 customer in front if you?
Why does the barista clean up and poke around behind the counter for minutes, when I am standing right here patiently waiting.   Its It's like a speed doesn't matter.  Disappointed with the service.  I will most likely not return."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2018-06-05,5.0,"My go to! Beware, Toby's gets CROWDED but there are no kinder baristas, delicious treats, and of course, dependable drips in the area. Despite the volume, they nearly never confuse orders, use top notch milks from oat to almond to your standards, and have perfected latte art. I've tried their cortados, Iced lattes, oat milk lattes, and drips countless times.

In terms of treats, the granola cup is my fave, but the (recently retired) pumpkin bun, pistachio cake, chocolate buckwheat cookie, and granola bars are also house favorites.

My day wouldn't be the same without you, Toby :)"
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2017-12-12,5.0,"5-star cold brew at a 5-star place. Usually a long line but there's a reason for it! Plus it moves quickly with the fast-paced (yet friendly) baristas. Definitely appreciate this Toby's in the land of Starbucks (aka Midtown). Cold brew is rich, delicious & well worth any wait!

980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2015-09-15,4.0,"Toby's Estate brings its hipster coffee brand to a new location in Midtown East, inside the brand new UrbanSpace Vanderbilt marketplace. This is the East Side version of Gotham West Market. Blue Bottle Coffee would have been amazing, but Toby's is a great roaster in and of itself. The best part about the Toby storefront inside this 12,000-square-foot food hall is that the popular doughnut shop, Dough, also sell Toby's Estate coffee near the entrance of the food hall.  Therefore, lines can be avoided if one is smart about it. 

The coffee renaissance continues in Midtown. Cafe Grumpy, Joe, and Gregory's now has serious competition."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2015-10-19,4.0,"Toby's Estate Coffee may have taken over my list as my favorite morning coffee spot! There are many coffee competitions especially around this area where the population work in corporate offices. Coffee is an essential part of our day whether it is the morning cup of coffee or an afternoon pick-me-up. It has become a social event until it is time for Happy Hour.

Urbanspace Vanderbilt hosts Toby's Estate Coffee and it is conveniently located right at the entrance on 45th Street and Park Avenue (directly across from the Metlife Building entrance and Naples). I normally arrive here around 7:30 am or so and there are already customers on line waiting for their fresh cup of coffee. I am in love with the Cold Brew here! It had this sweet and yet tarty flavor to it. I have also had the Lemon Scone. Although it is no longer warm, flavors of lemon citrus is really good. Texture is the perfect in-between soft and dry combination. I would suggest popping it in the toaster oven for just a few minutes. It goes great with the Cold Brew!"
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2016-11-07,4.0,"Good coffee with a great staff!

I am a semi regular at Toby's Estate Coffee and I have never been disappointed. The counter people are super nice and have a great sense of humor. The coffee is piping hot and delicious. They also have a large variety of milks and sweetners. 

This is definitely a favorite of mine!"
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2016-12-03,5.0,"Wow I'm very surprised to see that Toby's has 3.5 ratings. Personally, and I think a number of my colleagues would concur that Toby's serves the best coffee in terms of the bean they use and the people working there. 

I mean, yes, the speed with which they operate is phenomenally quick, it's locate in one of the most bustling spot in midtown. But from my experience, after seeing 6+ different baristas make coffee, I can confidently say that every one of them puts in so much care into brewing and cupping.

That said, what attracts me to this place, out of thousands of cafes around midtown, is definitely the people who works here. When you see their love of coffee and their willingness to provide a complete brewing experience by sitting you on the side of the cafe and explaining how the brewing is done and what kind of notes you can recognize from the cup, you'll see why it's such popular destination for all the people working around midtown. 

A huge shoutout to joe (and the rest of the crew) for always being so friendly, and willing to answer stupid coffee related questions. And most importantly, a big thank you for great cups of coffee!"
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2018-03-12,5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by my latte. It wasn't that sweet (which is normally my preference), but it still had caramel undertones. Slight bitter and rich taste that paired well with the pastry (purchased from other nearby stalls at UrbanSpace). I would recommend if you like simpler but really good quality coffee!"
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2016-07-12,5.0,"The quality at Toby's has improved very much since its openning that a new review is in order. 

This Toby has become my top go-to coffee spot, where I visit once in the morning and again in the afternoon for pick-me-up. In spite the long queue, the staff at Toby's are good in taking care of the customers and pumping out orders but still maintain quality. 

The flat whites have been consistently superb. The iced coffee and hot brew are reliably delicious. 

The baristas are very friendly here and will get to know you by name if you're a frequent customer. One of baristas has been promoted to manager at Toby's in Williamsburg. It's so good to see that Toby is rewarding its talented baristas. 

Get those stamp cards for +1 free after 10 orders."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2015-12-31,4.0,"I am always hesitated in trying new blend of coffee as there can always be surprise to the down side. But today is the last day of a whole year so I decided just to give a shot on the winter's specialty drink - winter's blend. As being told, it was on the medium to lighter end and indeed had a soft taste. I liked it a lot, very refreshing yet gentle.

Happy new year everyone! Wish everyone is having a refreshing and gentle 2016!"
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2015-10-15,5.0,"One of the best cortados I've had this year.  Espresso was tight (tight as in tizzight)!  Really nice complexity and earthiness, but not too third-wave...there was still a little bit of roastiness that came through every couple of sips.  I'm sure the milk was well done too, but I think it was the espresso that made this drink well, well, above average.

(For those of you who have seen my cafe grumpy love note: I'm not sure if it was on that level, but if not, it was close, and for at $3.50 vs. $4, it is a better value.)

I have been going to the Toby's in Williamsburg for years, and never had a cortado that was as good as the one I had at this location.  I found the staff more friendly and less stand-offish too.  To some extent, I would have expected the opposite on both the quality and service.

Finally, the cold brew on draft is very nice, and the little tubes of cold brew concentrate they sell are great too...because they I can make my cold brew even stronger."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2016-01-15,5.0,"We got our lattes at Toby's Estate in the Urbanspace Vanderbilt.

980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2018-01-27,4.0,Because of its location in the Urban Space food market you still get the good coffee you expect for Toby's but it's missing that extra something I've come to love at their other locations plus in the mornings it's a mad house.
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-26,5.0,My favorite coffee place in ny. Toby's knows how to do it right. I've had lattes and other espresso drinks here but they do an excellent job with plain old brewed drip coffee. Their cold brew on tap is also excellent. You can't go wrong at Tobys.
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2017-08-02,5.0,"My team love the coffee here, it is much stronger than Starbucks. If we can order and pick up, it will be perfect! The line is always long there!"
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2016-05-27,4.0,"With the development of Urbanspace, there's definitely more coffee options in Midtown now and so  glad Toby's Estate is a part of it. No longer do I have to trek to Flatiron for their tasty cappuccino. Their almond croissant is also very rich and has a lot of almond filling inside. I wish they have a loyalty program card. Or maybe they do and I'm just not aware of it."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2017-09-07,5.0,"Best coffee in Midtown East, with great staff.

I visit Toby's in UrbanSpace almost every morning and they never let me down. For my money they serve the best Cold Brew in NYC (rich, smooth and chocolatey), and have an excellent staff of baristas who are friendly, knowledgeable and efficient.

There's a reason there's always a line here, but it moves quickly and the coffee is worth it."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2016-07-22,4.0,"Their lattes, including the decaf one, are tasty. There are a few seats but it's not really convenient to sit there. More of a grab and go place."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2016-01-04,1.0,"I have to agree with some of the other posters here.  I was considering making this place a regular spot, but after my latest visits, that is unlikely. Some of the baristas have a nasty disposition, and basically give you A LOT of attitude for no reason, as if they're doing you a favor, and I for one will be limiting my visits here going forward.  The coffee is decent, but it isn't that great to put up with such bullshit.  I came here a bit earlier today and ordered a macchiato, and the guy looks at me and says ""WHAT?"", as if he's never heard the word before.  After repeating my order, he then drops my change in my hand like I was a vagabond.

In addition to the nasty customer service, there isn't much space to wait anywhere while they make your drinks, and the constant workers from the other booths walking back and forth dragging garbage about doesn't exactly make it that appetizing of an experience."
980,partners-coffee-new-york-4,2016-12-01,5.0,Very impressed. I love that they have flat whites on the menu. I went in this morning and they weren't open yet but they accommodated me nevertheless! I loved the fact that the staff was friendly and the latte I got was GREAT. I will definitely come back because I felt so welcomed.
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2020-04-16,4.0,"I ordered the New Orleans cold brew, and I thought it was pretty good, flavor-wise. It was pretty strong, and slightly bitter. I liked that it wasn't too sweet and had a smooth flavor. Although it was good, I think I can find a similar quality of coffee at other places for cheaper.

What I didn't like is that the lids don't fit perfectly on their paper cups, so the barista struggled to get the lid on and made a mess before giving up and asking me to put the lid on myself. They also don't put napkins out for you to take by yourself, so I had to ask for them after dealing with that messy coffee cup. No hate towards the barista, though. They did their best and they were friendly, but it was just an annoying experience."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2020-01-14,4.0,"Coffee isn't as good these days but these guys managed to commercialize the pour over and deserve lots of credit.

Lines aren't too bad albeit small area requires some twister. Right outside grand central makes it a plus.

Had the CR Tarazzu, it was ok not too bright, decent complexity, mo acidity, a lot of body with aftertaste. Hints of tangerine."

The location is convenient as it's across the street from Grand Central Station.  

Will definitely return."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-12-21,4.0,Cute little coffee shop right by Grand Central. Very limited seating but fortunately the line moved relatively quickly. Cappuccino and oat milk latte were both solid. Nice alternative to Starbucks!
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-09-18,5.0,"A small but great location! Popped in here as I was craving some sugar and wanted to grab their delicious New Orleans coffee. There were some repairs going on in the already small space so even the short line overcrowded the cafe. However, the workers were efficient as always and I didn't end up waiting long at all. 

The space is bright and clean, and blue bottle offers the most delicious options. I ordered my small New Orleans with almond milk and it was made very quickly. It was so delicious as always and was just what I needed that afternoon. 

There is no seating here and as mentioned, the space is very small. It's definitely more of a place where people can grab their coffees during the morning rush or pop in quickly for an afternoon pick-me-up. Still great nonetheless!"
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-10-09,5.0,"I am not here to talk about how good their coffee is. We all know that! I came in today craving something sweet to enhance my mood in this gloomy weather. I tried their butter cake with salt sizzles on top. It was really good. The guy was very nice and reminded me of my first experience at Blue Bottle in San Francisco. I dropped my coffee and felt so bad about it so they give me another coffee and free desert! 

The spot is hidden, so make sure you don't miss it! Space is small and cute. You grab coffee and go to work if you commute thru grand central."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-09-19,4.0,"The coffee here, specifically the cold brew I always order and not sure what region it comes from taste distinctly different from Starbucks Pike Place, etc...it is pungent, bitter, floral, a hint of spice and not sugary sweetness. I didn't add sugar or milk. The milk option is one, I think it's whole milk because there's no labeling. In terms of bites, it's just a pastry or two.

The location is almost barebones. It has no restroom. No public WiFi. It has three seats w. tables. But it has free water and many accessories. Hip music is playing, not loudly, nor softly.

I have been here a few times and notice the staff rotates. They're sometimes friendlier than other times. Most the time they have a serious demeanor. Today, I had a smiling chap serve my coffee."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-11-15,1.0,"I work in 120 park avenue which is right next to this BB location, so I always swing by for morning New Orleans coffee on weekdays. I don't drink anything else at BB, only New Orleans religiously, because its that good for me.

Today (11/15, Friday), I paid for New Orleans and when I came to the office and took a few sips, i realized it was just a regular ice coffee with milk. Come on....really guys? This is how you lose royal customers. 

@Management, please kindly remind your new employees on providing goods customers paid for, which is a basic quality check of service. This is not a great customer experience to pay for one thing and get something lesser in return."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-03-15,5.0,"Can't say enough good things about how amazing the staff at this location is. The knowledge and quality of the coffee drinks are always on point. You are always greeted kindly by the baristas and the shop is always kept exceptionally clean. It is also one of the most culturally diverse staffs I have seen at a cafe, which i can very much appreciate. Every staff member I come in contact has such a unique and interesting background that it always leads to a fun conversation for every visit. Not sure that is ideal for the patrons in line after me though!"
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-08-26,1.0,"Ok....as a person who's from Bay Area I love blue bottle!!! But this location really disgusts me out. There's a cockroach on the counter as you can see in the photos...I told BOTH baristas who were making coffee that time, and none of them gives a fk.  It's really disgusting because the rag that has a cockroach is the one they use to clean the stick for steaming milk. I feel bad for ppl who get latte there."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-01-14,4.0,"Excellent cup of cappuccino! 

This Blue Bottle Coffee location is literally a hole in the wall and it is meant for take out. There are really only three chairs by the windows; two on one side and one on the other side. It does feel nice to sit by the window to enjoy a cup of coffee with a nice view of Grand Central Terminal and the busy streets of New York City. 

My favorite items here are the Cappuccino and the Ginger Molasses Cookie. Cappuccino has a nice balance of coffee and milk. Ginger Molasses Cookie is sooo delicious! It is a very soft cookie with a kick of ginger with the right amount of sugar. Sometimes, I am tempted to get a second one!

Prices are steep for its size but this is true quality."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-07-17,5.0,"Blue Bottle Coffee in NYC is stellar! A must try is the iced mocha. Now if you're like me and think that Starbucks Mochas taste like chocolate milk, and prefer a darker,
more bitter chocolate, this one is for you! The dark chocolate perfectly complemented the smooth espresso! There is limited seating in the store, but if you walk just a few steps outside there is an open patio area where you can sip your coffee. Note that there is only one size, so if you are wanting a large coffee, this isn't the place to get it. I would estimate the size as about a 12-14 oz. I had no complaints about the size, because the coffee was rich and delicious! I'll have to find one of these in California!"
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-02-14,3.0,"If this was just a review for the New Orleans, it would be 10 stars. Unfortunately, this location is tiny and often plagued by tourists who don't know what to order, so the line management isn't always the best. I've also found that the quality of the drink depends on who is making your beverage -- the amount of milk can be pretty inconsistent. Food-wise, love their croissants, the waffle (definitely try a sample if they're giving them out!), and the overnight oats."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-09-19,4.0,"Super limited seating here (three seats to be exact) but the product is as good as any of the other locations. Great spot for grab and go, right across the street from Grand Central. Cold brew is my favorite!"
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-06-16,5.0,Stopped for a quick cappuccino on our way to Bryant Park. Blue Bottle never disappoints and the staff is the sweetest!
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2020-01-29,5.0,"Incredibly friendly staff. It's a small location and gets a bit crowded during rush times, but when you need a GOOD coffee in the area, this is where you go."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-02-14,4.0,Such a small location but a great one. Extremely clean and excellent service. Need to come back here again and try the expresso. Honestly the best part about this place is the speed and prediction they bring while delivering good coffee. Definitely more expensive than Starbucks. Still a great option and does tend to get busy and cramped. Only downside about this place is that it is so small there's barley and room so Its kind of awkward on where to wait for your beverage.
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-05-29,1.0,"Oh boy... Just came from this place... Yet again I waited excessively long for my cortado... I've been here several times in the last few weeks, and the last two times have really tried my patience.  Ordered a cortado the last two times and both times they were made incorrectly by the same barista, so on top of the long wait, I had to wait even longer to have the drink re-made.  I don't understand why this location, with such a small footprint only has ONE barista to make espressos, cortados, and other such drinks. I keep trying to give this place a chance, but the waits are ridiculous, and the lines are all over the place. I can see waiting 10 minutes for a drink, but with only two people ahead of me, my waits are usually more like 20 minutes here.  By comparison, the new Rockefeller Center location and Bryant Park location blow this place out of the water."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-03-07,5.0,"This blue bottle coffee is a very small grab-and-go location. Coffee is good, as always, albeit extremely pricey. It's your typical San Francisco-ian bougie coffee that will be smaller than normal.

There is window seating with maybe around 4 seats if you need to pop in for a seat. I saw people working on their iPads and laptops, so they probably have wifi."

981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2017-11-05,4.0,"Blue Bottle Coffee is the perfect way to start your day. It is rather pricey, so make it a few times a week habit.
I am a fan of the drip coffee. Its called drip coffee, and not instant coffee, so it will take some time for the drip coffee to be made. Make sure you are not in a huge rush if you get drip coffee.
if you are in a huge rush, there is also a small refrigerator where you can get coffee in paper cartons."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-02-22,5.0,"My first blue bottle experience! i've been wanting to try their coffee for a long time, and i had no idea i was passing it everyday on my way to the UN! The staff are super friendly and very good at their jobs. Giant Steps is my favorite blend there (cocoa, toasted marshmallow, graham cracker). The aesthetics are great too. small coffee shop vibes. i just wish they had unsweetened non-dairy milk (they have unsweetened oat milk but that's a lot of calories)--like almond or cashew milk unsweetened. I want to try the espresso, but i don't consume sugar/sweeteners!! Anyways, come here if you want a great cup of coffee. why spend the same amount at starbucks, when you have better coffee at bluebottle??"
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-08-09,4.0,"Yum! I had a latte and a chocolate chip cookie in the late afternoon. Cookie was amazing, coffee is very good. The view is terrific, across from Grand Central & fun people watching @ the counter."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2017-11-02,5.0,Maybe I'm biased because they just opened up downstairs in my office building but this location is excellent. Directly across from grand central so it's a very central location. Everyone working is friendly and of course the coffee is delicious.
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2019-07-09,4.0,Ordered a cold brew. Very good wish I was aware of the other options such as oat milk only regular milk on the counter. The only negative was the paper straws it was wilted after 10 minutes but I understand the reasoning behind it so can't complain. Good cup of coffee
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-01-12,4.0,I love blue bottle! Their drip coffee is excellent and it's just fun to watch the batistas at work! I'm taking away a star for price - an almond milk cappuccino runs me close to $6 and is smaller than most other places. Standard for a almond cappuccino in NYC is $5 and they are just as high quality and delicious!  My advice: try it a few times and decide if the price point us worth it to you.
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-03-12,4.0,"I got the latte with oat milk and I thought it was great! The coffee was smooth and although I could tell that it would be bitter anywhere else, I didn't get that bitter gross after taste I get from some other coffee shops! I highly recommend!"
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-09-06,5.0,I am so pregnant. It is SO hot in NYC right now. I ordered an iced latte to temporarily dull my heat-wave misery and the kind man ringing me up saw my huge belly and comped the drink for me. Maybe I'm hormonal (...I know I'm hormonal) but it honestly made my week. Small kindness and a delicious iced latte = happy happy lady.
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-01-25,5.0,"I've been wanting to try a Blue Bottle cafe but never had the opportunity until recently. This location is right across the street from Grand Central Station. It's a small place and only about four or five seats. The atmosphere is welcoming and inviting. The cafe is very organized and clean. I was able to try some of the baked goods that are put out fresh each day, they were rich and flavorful. The coffee here is the highlight. I asked for something in a medium roast and my server recommended a few choices and briefly described each. It was interesting watching the way the pour over was done, very precise. The coffee was delicious. Even my friend who is not even a huge coffee fan really enjoyed it."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-03-13,4.0,Small place but latte is really good! I had had latte for many times during my trip in NYC and would say this one is my favorite! Really smooth and doesn't have the bitterness at all.
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-08-23,5.0,"Love this location of my neighborhood Blue Bottle Coffee. Their Cappuccino and Cortado is always spot on, sometimes it takes an extra minute but if you want super fast coffee served by a barista not paying any attention then go to Starbucks. - I did have to wait the extra minute today and didn't mind at all. When I came back in the afternoon the very lovely barista gave me an Almond Croissant for the patient waiting game earlier in the day."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-02-28,1.0,"Terrible experience. Waited 20mins to receive the worst cortado of my life. The reason was because the grinder went down but the staff were unable to redial in the espresso. It tasted burnt... and very bitter.

Staff did not communicate why there was a delay. And secondly they didn't care much about serving bad espresso. Not going back this location."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-07-21,5.0,"The coffee is really special. We particularly appreciated Will, our barista, who took the time to tell us all about the coffee and the process. He clearly loves bringing the joy of awesome coffee to those who stop in."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-07-08,2.0,"I stopped here on my way to MSG because I heard this place had great coffee, and I didn't want to stop in at Starbucks. I ordered an iced americano and I have to say it was one of the worst coffees I've ever had. So, so bitter and I couldn't drink it. But because I paid almost $5 for the drink, I sucked it down. Sorry, I wanted to like the coffee. 2 stars because the service was great."

981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-09-14,1.0,"Staff is slow and rude. As if that wasn't enough, the coffee served (I tried the Bella Donovan and New Orleans) is of worse quality than the nearby Bryant Park unit."
981,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-15,2018-03-12,5.0,"Great service and a fancy cappuccino goes a long way on a Monday. This little gem definitely brightened my midday coffee break. Its definitely a small shop, just for pick up and go, but I think I found my new favorite spot for a cup of Joe."

982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-02-24,5.0,"Cute icecream spot : check
Nice place to chill : check
Amazing flavours : check
Satisfied sweet tooth : check!!! 

Thats Van Leeuwen! One of the best icecream spots in NYC! We found this on our Yelp search when we were craving icecream. The interior was white and clean. They have seating arrangements as well. 
I tried walnut crunch and my friend tried the earl grey. Walnut crunch was so damn good!! Earl grey was amazing too. Both the icecreams had a rich and creamy texture. The flavour was something new and different! Very friendly service. You can get the waffle/ normal cones or cups. They have plenty of vegan options too! 
Overall this is a must visit spot!"
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-03-23,3.0,"Maybe I was given too high of expectations with this place, but I thought it was pretty standard and nothing special. I went with the cookies and cream after sampling that and the earl grey ice cream.  The earl grey was a bit too sweet, and I didn't really like it (and i am an avid earl grey tea drinker). 

The cookies and cream was good, but I couldn't  help but think of better cookies and cream ice cream I have had prior. The cone was also nothing special."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-03-05,4.0,"My friends and I were visiting NY and we were so intrigued with Van Leeuwen because this place is SO cute! Love the decor and pastel colors. Sprinkled walls?! What more could you ask for! lol 
Big location too so nice place to hang out if you want to get away from the cold a bit. 

They have tons of vegan options which was cool. I ordered a small cup of pistachio with rainbow sprinkles. Very good quality ice cream! the pistachio flavor was very potent with no fake green coloring. A little on the expensive side though. 

My friends all ordered different items..hot chocolate, affogato, etc. and everyone was very impressed! We mainly walked our way through NY and found out there are a bunch of locations! If you like high end ice cream, then definitely check them out!"

Kiara's customer service was outstanding.
She patiently and graciously suggested flavors to try. We were really impressed with her care.
We'll definitely be back!!!

Forgot to mention I had the Ginger Lemon Poppy seed vegan ice cream.. super delish!!!!!!!

Thanks Kiara!!"
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-02-18,5.0,"Came here for dessert after a dinner.  And the yelpers got this place right.  It is a bit pricey but I don't eat much ice cream so I always get a small. 

I tried a lot of the vegan flavors and I must say they all had a surprisingly nice creamy texture to them.  And all of the flavors were delicious but I decided to go with the mocha latte on the vegan side and the honeycomb on the classic side.  The mocha latte was rich with a strong espresso flavor.  It was good on its own but when I tasted the sweet vanilla flavored honeycomb I knew this would be a great combo with the mocha latte.  Every coffee needs it's vanilla. Lol. And every latte needs it's cream.  It was definitely a match made in heaven. I got a small cup. It was about $4.60.  But it was enough for me.

I do want to give a shout out to Queeta she was the greatest. Very patient and knowledgeable about all the flavors.  She was very sweet too."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-04-03,4.0,Visited here in early March and it was perfect for a warm day! Very nice service and lots of space inside. They allowed me to sample prior to purchasing which was great since the price for ice cream was a bit on the higher end. I ordered their Mocha Cookie Crumble and thought the flavor was not too overly sweet. A size small was very filling and thought it was a good amount.
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-01-26,5.0,"So we were looking for an ice cream place where we had place to chill for a few. Love that they had seating for a few. We decided to get the Earl Grey and well as the Hazelnut Crunch ice cream cones. I loved how it was dropped into a cup for us to avoid spilling.

I got the Earl Grey being a  chai lover, and I LOVED EVERY BIT OF IT.

My chocolate loving friend got the Hazelnut crunch and said it was pretty good.

Loved the flavors, the vibe and the service here."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-01-10,5.0,"I'm always down for a good scoop of ice cream, and though I'm used to our staple Salt & Straw in Portland, I was ready to try something new. 

What I appreciate about Van Leeuwen ice cream is that there are both vegan and regular options available. They have a simple and easy to read menu with a nice selection of traditional and seasonal flavors. Though the place is small, with not a lot of seating, the white interior immediately helps open the space up making it look clean, warm, and inviting.

We tried their cookies & cream and it was heavenly. I have never tasted such a smooth, rich, yet creamy ice cream before. One bite in and you can immediately tell that the ice cream is well made from fresh ingredients.There is definitely a difference in quality between the ice cream you get here compared to most other ice cream parlors. 

Still dreaming about this ice cream even though I'm now back in Portland. Sorry Salt & Straw, but I think I've found a new favorite...

A must try if you're ever in NYC!!"
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-10-29,4.0,"Well after missing the Grand Opening because I didn't hear any announcement or date I finally game down to check out the new store. 

And I came for one reason and one reason only, because I heard they have a banana ice cream based on Magnolia Bakery's Banana Pudding which just happens to be on the same block a few doors down.

Well the store located on the 6th Ave side of Rockefeller Center and it was empty at lunch time, someone forgot to put out the word ? Himmm... 

So I ask for 2 scoops of the MB banana ice cream which is only available for a limited time on a waffle cone with caramel and peanut brittle dust toppings. Well I take a spoonful and lo and behold it taste like banana, how they do that ?

I think it had banana bits too, The texture of the banana was solid but not hard and not as flavorful as the ice cream, maybe because of the sugar with the caramel and peanut brittle mixed into it. 

I asked for two scoops because I wasn't sure of what size they are and didn't want the ice cream to disappear into the waffle cone but they were huge, and at first I didn't think I would eat it all but I did. The waffle cone had a good taste too and didn't get soggy.

No CASH here, card only which is that is beginning to bug me because it forces me to walk around with both when I decide to venture out of the office.  Coffee and drinks are also available here too and I needed one after stuffing myself."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-10-16,5.0,"Yet another Van Leeuwen, this time in an excellent location for tourists and anybody near Rockefeller Center.

This is their first location with a cool new high tech digital menu board (and actually maybe the first ice seen at any NYC ice cream shop so far). After several tiny ones recently, this is one their bigger spaces with plenty of room for standing and sitting along the outskirts.

The most important detail here though is the limited time exclusive Banana Pudding flavor they partnered with their neighbor Magnolia Bakery for. It tastes just like the iconic dessert, and is a great reason to visit soon before it's gone."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-11-03,4.0,"Note: Credit/Debit only for purchases and tippong.  Can use cash for tipping jar.

A new ice cream parlor opens at the Rock Center (aka Rockefeller Center).  Only fresh ingredients are used to make ice cream scoops call classic or vegan.

When your walk in the door, there is a freezer with pre-packaged ice cream on be your left.  There are seats on the right side for you to enjoy your treat.

If you continue going straight, check out the menu and you will see the containers of ice cream flavors.  Taste all the flavors you want since the store uses mini steel spoons instead of plastic ones.

After trying several flavors including the special collision magnolia banana pudding ice cream, I decided on the Earl Grey ice cream.  Your can really taste the tea flavor in the ice cream.

So excited that there are so many flavors to taste... Hope your get to try too."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-11-04,4.0,"Van Leeuwen comes in top for ice-cream that can match my other favorite ice-cream companies with interesting and unique flavors in the south and the west coast.  I'm not a huge ice-cream fan, but I do like interesting flavors and Van Leeuwen comes in great for that.  This post is a bit overdue as I had lost the picture of the flavor ice-cream that I tried but I found it!

Chai Tea Toffee:
PROS
- great amount of ice-cream: I can never finish the scoop I get each time.
- super creamy, no little bits of ice
- not super sweet (but this can depend on the flavor that you get): I really like chai and chai itself isn't ridiculously decadent so this suits my taste buds really well
- you get to sample different flavors! This is the best!
CONS
- none!

I'd definitely love to come back as they swap out the menu for seasonal flavors.  Probably one of my favorite places for ice-cream in New York!"
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-01-26,3.0,"We ordered  two scoops of Sicilian pistachio and caramel cookies and cream. They only accept electronic payment (credit, debit, Apple Pay, etc), no cash... which is fine by me since I predominately use credit anyway for the points).

The pistachio was good... but the taste was soft and muted. I've had amazing pistachio where the flavor really pops (since pistachio is kind of a more subtle flavor that can get lost against another flavor, like the waffle cone). On the flip side, the caramel cookies and cream was waaaaay too sweet. When we sampled it... it tasted good but having a scoop made me feel like I just ate some diabetes. 

Also, this spot is a bit expensive for the quality of ice cream you get. There's a bunch of other places I'd rather go to... this was just the closest spot when the craving hit. I probably wouldn't eat here again. Would rather walk the extra distance to get better  ice cream"
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-12-14,5.0,"Had a tough day at work and I walked past this place and decided to treat myself to some ice cream. This shop has vegan flavors and as well as traditional ice cream. I had two scoops: one regular and one vegan. Brown sugar chunk  was the one made with milk and the cookie dough crunch was made with oat milk. Couldn't tell the difference between the two! They were both delicious!

I'm glad I work by this shop so I can frequent it kore often. The staff was nice and I got taken care of promptly. They don't accept cash but they do take Apple Pay which is pretty cool."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-03-09,5.0,"Was recommended by some friends to check our Van Leeuwen when we were in NYC, and it did not disappoint! What I loved was that they had a variety of classic and interesting flavors, as well as so many vegan options. We got a scoop of earl grey tea (best earl grey ice cream I've ever had) and the vegan ginger lemon poppy seed crumble (very bright tasting yet still creamy) and they were both super tasty and dense in a good way. The shop itself was also incredibly cute and pastel-y, with lots of cute photo ops. If I'm in New York again, I will definitely be back!"
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-01-12,5.0,Excellent high quality delicious vegan ice cream. Came here after the NBC Studio tour. What a great ice-cream store. Very much recommend.

They have a lot of options, including a whole vegan ice cream menu. You can get waffle cones, or sugar cones, as well as cups. They also offer a variety of beverages including hot cocoa, coffee and such. 

My only complaint sounds kind of ridiculous, but it was colder than it was  outside in February in that place. I understand it's an ice cream shop but turn up the heat a little."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-11-26,4.0,"This area is essentially an ice cream dessert, and I'm glad Van Leeuwen has moved in, pricey as it is. I tried the pumpkin and Magnolia banana pudding on my most recent visit. (I'm not a pudding fan, but I appreciated it in this form.) The mint chip is always a good idea, too. 

Pretty spacious, and there was no line when I visited on a weekday afternoon."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-12-30,5.0,"A very clean and large spot near Rockefeller center. I came in here after visiting the Christmas tree with my boyfriend. The cashiers were both very friendly and the furniture matched the interior very nicely. There are special seasonal flavors (hazelnut fudge crunch, F-A-O  Schwirl, earl grey & cookies, and peppermint stick) and a special flavor for the broadway show, Dear Evan Hansen. I was given two generous scoops of ice cream. I love the quality of their ice cream. Every flavor is very rich and creamy. They allow you to sample flavors and use reusable spoons! Great job. Keep it up!"

I wasn't interested in the seasonal flavors so I went with the earl grey from the classic menu. The earl grey was delicious! The ice cream was also very smooth. I got one scoop on a waffle cone and it was a very filling dessert. I wished I had room to get another scoop!
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-04-05,5.0,Awesome little ice cream scoop shop with some good vegan options! So tasty and creamy! Aesthetically the shops is also very pretty with its bright yellow walls and granite tables.

I am so glad that they are finally open and there is a place to get VEGAN ice cream in midtown! I ended up getting the FAO schwirl which was AMAZING! They made it with oat milk! And it's vegan! It did not taste like most ice cream where it has loads and loads of sugar! I can't wait to come back to have more flavors
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-12-23,3.0,"I've gone to my share of Van Leeuwens, so I was surprised at the odd texture of the honeycomb - too wet, maybe too melted. It was also super sweet and not finishable.

However, I'd recommend checking out their seasonal vegan Earl Grey and cookies. The cookie texture was really nice with the subtle tea flavor. 

The two people working here were doing their best with the holiday crowds, but it was a bit messy in the shop. They could have used someone else working today."

The girl behind the counter seriously gave me attitude - rolled her eyes- and grunted when I asked to BUY A SCOOP OF ICE CREAM. 

She didn't say a  single  word during the entire  transaction- except for the words ""well, are you gonna pay?"" at the end.

What happened to Hello, How may I help you, Thank You and / or Have a nice day?

Apparently they don't have these ""flavors"".

982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-01-11,5.0,"LOVE VAN LEEUWENS. 

A place where dairy and nondairy people UNITE.  my favorite  non dairy flavors, mint chip, strawberry, chocolate, cookies for breakfast, matcha, and so many more.

Dairy tolerant flavors, earl grey, pistachio, cookies and cream, oh how the list goes on."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-02-18,5.0,"I have to say, I've tried a variety of Van Leeuwen ice cream flavors over the past year and this is starting to become one of my new favorites. This is their newest location - right near rockefeller center. Tried a bunch of their new flavors - Irish cream (absolutely amazing), Marionberry cheesecake (super weird flavor because who has ever heard of marionberry but it reminds me of lingonberries (which are Swedish) and I love cheesecake), vegan churros and fudge, Vegan lemon poppy seed, Peppermint (delectable). Also, their original flavors of cookies and cream - solid. Brown sugar chunk ( I got this one by the pint and its cookie dough and fudge brownies and brown sugar - oh my god). I think what amazes me the most with Van Leeuwen and separates them apart from their fellow ice cream makers is that the actual base of their ice cream is superior without any add ins. I'm even drawn to all of their vegan flavors they taste so good. There was an oat milk cookie flavor that is out of this world."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-10-29,4.0,"I was walking by this location and really wanted some ice cream, so I figured I'd try it out. For two scoops of ice cream I paid about $8, kinda pricey when a pint is $10. I ended up trying two different flavors, one from the regular menu and one vegan. Both were good. My favorite was the chocolate brownie fudge flavor, but beware this ice cream is super rich and sweet. I love sweets and it was a lot for me to eat the entire thing. Everyone was nice inside and it was clean too."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-10-18,5.0,"My favorite ice cream shop has a location in Midtown! Convenient location right near Rockefeller Center. Next to Warby Parker and Magnolia. 

They currently have a collaboration with Magnolia with banana pudding ice cream. It tastes just like banana pudding. Fall flavors also include pumpkin cheesecake (my favorite) and lemon basil shortbread. 

The interior is huge, colorful, and well-lit, similar to other locations. There is also a metal corner with a lighted sign perfect for photo ops. The employees are friendly per usual. 

Quality still amazing, just in a more convenient location."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-01-10,5.0,"Well, who eats ice-cream when it's 26 degrees outside and windy??? This Florida girl here! I love finding new ice-cream shop. This shop is unique because it has the option of vegan and regular ice-cream. Sooooo even if you're trying have a healthier eating lifestyle, this parlor gives you that option.

I had the regular ice-cream. Double scoop, Salted caramel and pistachio ice-cream! It was super delicious. Creamy and flavorful!"
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-11-03,4.0,"My friends and I have been waiting for this location to open up for the longest. We would check every day to see if it was opened as they promised to be opened by August. August comes around and they're still closed.. two months later they finally opened! This place is pretty spacious and big for an ice cream place though there isn't a ton of seating or the seats get taken up way too quick since it's a tourist area. 

Ice cream at Van Leeuwen is pretty expensive as a small scoop runs a little over $6 with tax and a print is around $10 before tax I believe. I finally stopped by with my friend and tried their limited edition banana pudding ice cream. It was delicious and I hope they make it a permanent flavor (at least for this location)."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-02-12,4.0,"Got the honeycomb ice cream, it was very sweet and creamy. The consistency was a little too soft and melty, it might be because they actually had too much sugar in here so it lowered the freezing point too much. A touch less sugar would probably benefit this one if possible. The service was friendly and let me try different flavors. Overall decent ice cream but not truly outstanding (probably because I don't care if they have vegan ice cream or not, I just purely care about eating good tasting food)."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-12-07,5.0,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. I first came here in the summer for dessert and had a scoop of the salted caramel. It was sooo good and their scoops are generous! Most recently, I came here and got their seasonal pumpkin cheesecake which was insanely delicious! My mom got their vegan coconut ice cream which was also so good."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-10-29,5.0,"I've walked by this location many times while it was under construction. Finally walked by a couple weeks ago and it was open and only one other customer!! Perfect time to try out their ice cream - usually it's been too crowded at other locations and I hate waiting in lines. The server was sooo nice and friendly - she let us try several flavors - the Magnolia banana pudding is terrific and limited time only.   We ended up getting the pumpkin cheesecake ice cream - not too sweet and chunks of graham cracker crust made this perfect!!! The chocolate brownie flavor was awesome and super rich - my daughter made it into a hot fudge sundae. It was yummy but the hot fudge seemed a little thin - more like chocolate sauce. It is a little pricey, but you can tell the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. Definitely worth the splurge. And the service was very nice and friendly."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-02-24,5.0,So friendly and sooo delicious! Cute atmosphere and good music. I can see why it's such a popular spot.
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-10-26,5.0,"Came here during my lunch break with a few coworkers since I heard about the limited time banana pudding flavor they were having at this new location with Magnolia Bakery. 

This spot is a great location between 49th and 50th street on 6th Ave right by Radio City Music Hall. Magnolia Bakery is on the same block right on the corner of 49th which explains why Van Leeuwen's decided to collaborate with them for their new opening. 

Van Leeuwen is known for their vegan ice cream, but the non-vegan flavors are good as well. The Oat Milk Chocolate Crunch is my favorite but it was sold out the day I went. I ended up just getting a scoop of the Banana Pudding and it tastes just like the actual dessert! I'll going to have to come back soon before that flavor is gone!"
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-02-16,5.0,"I was super amazed with the earl grey tea ice cream that I ordered, since I'm a heavy tea drinker. I checked the locations and there's a nearby one in my work place! Will keep coming back!"
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-01-25,5.0,"The ice cream was delicious! Long line, but went rather quickly. Next time I'm in NYC, I will be back for more."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2020-01-05,5.0,"They have no bathrooms. Now that that is out of the way, the ice cream is actually one of the smoothest I've ever tasted. They don't place a sample limit like some of the other ice cream shops around the city do, so try your heart out. I got an espresso flavor that was absolutely sublime and I would empty my bladder prior to taking the subway just to come here again. The service is nice enough. Seating can be a bit sparse but I don't mind sharing personal space with other ice cream eaters because you can rest assured 1) no one is talking during this scrumptious experience and 2) I don't even hear anything when I'm eating this ice cream other than the sound of the a harp overlying the crashing of ocean waves. You get the point."
982,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-39,2019-10-26,3.0,"The ice cream was okay. Not worth the price and a little too sweet. 

They wouldn't let my little sister use the bathroom and instead offered walking a block and a half to a McDonalds. We just spent more than $15 on ice cream and my 6-yr-old sister can't use your bathroom? Give me a break."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2020-02-10,4.0,"Have picked up items a few times. This place is so convenient since it's close to the subway. Their coffee was pretty good and they made it perfect for L. It wasn't bitter at all and he likes it really sweet. He was quite happy. 
I've only had the doughnuts here and they're okay. They're not too sweet so thats a plus. My mom liked them. She basically gobbled up the chocolate one without realizing what flavor it was. She does not like chocolate normally."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-12-13,3.0,"I have mixed thoughts about this place - on one hand, the granola bar is out of this world. I could eat it every day and not get sick of it. Drinks and other food items are decent but it's the granola bar that takes the cake. On the other hand, it feels cramped inside even when there's just a handful of customers and it's a bit piecemeal what's self serve and what isn't. 

I love a good coffee shop atmosphere, so it's a shame that the experience here just doesn't do it for me. I'll continue to simply grab and go and suggest you do to."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-10-27,5.0,"Cute little place,  clean and comfortable. 
The coffee is strong and the food is good quality. 
I had a bagel that was fresh and delicious. 
Polite employees and quick service."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-09-21,3.0,"Since it was not that far from where we were staying (on our vacation in Manhattan), we decided to try here for breakfast. They have the usual choices you were expecting any caffeine. They did have their own unique choices of pastries and breakfast sandwiches though. I had the avocado toast which was delicious. The setting/ambient was quiet and relaxing at the time that we were visiting here. It's a good go to for a nice quick breakfast and a sit down with coffee in this part of town."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-12-24,3.0,"Came here for a quick bite and cup of coffee after seeing our original brunch spot was too crowded. 

Not too many options, but everything looks very healthy and organic, and the prices were pretty high because of it. 

I ordered the avocado toast, my friends had the yogurt with berries and granola, breakfast burrito, coffee, latte, and cappuccino. They had forgotten to give us the cappuccino so they gave us a free item card, which my friend used to get an iced coffee. 

For the price (~$9), my avocado toast was average--i've had better for cheaper. I've even made better for cheaper. The toast itself was really thick and there was too little avocado for the size of the toast (and the price). I liked the feta and pickled onions, not a fan of the seeds though. It tasted good and healthy, but I don't think I'd ever get it again. 

My friend really enjoyed the breakfast burrito. 

I really liked the vibe/interior of the place though. Very hipster-modern. Employees were kind, too."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-11-06,5.0,"Very nice cafe offering breakfast items and delicious coffee items, as well as matcha."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-08-16,1.0,"I'm freaking out having just read Natalie C.'s review, the one just prior to this one.

My wife and I had exactly the same experience with the avocado toast, and it was quite possibly that same day! We recently returned from a one week visit to the Big Apple. Apparently Irving Farm was repeatedly poisoning people with this garbage throughout the day. I'm sure this couldn't be their everyday recipe or they'd be shut down by the health department by now.

We were walking the city that day, late morning, and saw the Irving Farm coffee shop and walked in spontaneously. We ordered 2 coffees and an order of avocado toast to share. The place looked nice----tucked into a nook of a tall modern looking building in a very ritzy part of town. We ordered from a pleasant young girl and several young guys were also working behind the counter.

Well, this avocado toast arrives and everything looks normal and we bite into it and there is so much salt in it that my face actually started going into convulsions. Folks, this isn't a case where the chef was a little heavy handed with the salt----this is a complete kitchen fuck up, cataclysm, disaster so horrible it almost seems deliberate by some disgruntled douchebag working the food line trying to kill somebody. I have never in my entire life ever tasted this much salt in one bite. How could Irving Farm allow this to happen? How could nobody notice it, taste it or catch on? Who is making their food back there? Somebody who doesn't know what salt is or how to use it? Somebody with the worst kitchen skills in the entire human race?

When we recovered enough to talk and figure out what had just happened to us, we decided to scrape all of the remaining poisoned avocado goo off and try a bite of the toast by itself. It would have been pretty nice stuff but the pounds of salt had leeched into the bread too of course. We walked out a short time later without complaining, sending it back, getting a refund or calling the police to report an attempted food murder."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-11-25,5.0,"Great environment, very urban but cozy feel. Got the avocado toast with scrambled egg, plating and taste was great. Also got an oat milk latte which was the best part. Whole experience was great."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-12-31,3.0,"Came here bc it was right next door to our hotel.  It did the job for quick pastry breakfast and to get our caffeine fix.  Ordered a cortado and something was off about it,  I ended up having to use excessive amounts of sugar in order to drink it."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-04-06,5.0,"This place is definitely on the more expensive side, but I loved it so much that I went back the day after!

I ordered the Overnight Oats Bowl here, and an oat milk latte. A+ stuff man.

The Overnight Oats was a medley of healthy nuts and grains. The chia seeds really helped plump up everything to taste almost pudding-like. The honey drizzled on top was divine. Whatever milk/yogurt they soaked the oats in was creamy and rich, and it didn't even upset my stomach! That's huge for a lactose intolerant loser like me.

I love the way they make their oat lattes too. It tastes rich. Ah yes. My new favorite milk substitute.

Don't get their breakfast sandwiches or scrams though. It's heavily overpriced for what you're getting."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-09-14,1.0,"If you plan to eat here, come with at least 30 minutes to spare. My partner & I both ordered a breakfast burrito, I took my order first. Sounds simple, right? But somehow the employee only rang up my boyfriends order, after waiting at least 20 minutes he only came out with one plate. I tried to be patient and wait for mine to come out but I was on a schedule and couldn't afford to leisurely wait around for another 20/30 min. All the other reviews sounded so promising and exceptional! But to future customers please repeat back what you ordered... even if you had put your order in first."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-08-08,1.0,"Went in today as I was staying at nearby hotel and was looking for a quick breakfast. Ordered avocado toast with egg. First it came with no egg, and when it arrived, I took a bite of the toast and it was completely inedible! It tasted like they spilled the salt container into the avocado mash. I'm not sure how you can mess up smearing avocado on a piece of toast but apparently it could be done. I didn't have the patience to send it back as I was running late--I left it on the table. What a waste!

As for the coffee, I ordered a coffee with steamed almond milk. No almond milk they said, how about oat? OK, no problem, that sounds fine. Well, then they just gave me the coffee with no milk whatsoever. Couldn't be bothered."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-07-09,3.0,"I often visited Irving Farm Roasters to treat myself because their chai latte was the best rendition of Chai that I've had in New York. Though they must have changed their recipe since I've found it recently to be lacking in flavor, and at times--even watery. Disappointing, as what was once my favorite midday treat, is now not much more than a $4 weak concoction of watered down milk with barely a hint of Chai. Their Coffee game is still strong, and I'm not against spending an afternoon here in their cozy lounge area to get some laptop bizness done. I just do this now, while contemplating the good ol' days of their famed Chai latte."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2017-05-30,4.0,"This is the third Irving Farms I've been to eat, or drink coffee. They are clean with a modern atmosphere and prices to match. 
The food looks delicious. My Las Vegas Yelp friends enjoy it immensely. The wait for service is minimal. Employees knowledgeable and friendly. Tables are cleaned regularly. 
They do not have WiFi. One down side. It is a great place to meet if you want to sip coffee and chat. Not loud at all. 
I like this location. It's on my way to midtown. Sure, I'll return. Ellen and Cesar from Las Vegas Yelp ate. Ellen's Scone sounded and looked really good. I may try that for breakfast. I'm sure if I do you'll know!"
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-09-09,4.0,"Really cool decor, interesting drink and food items, friendly staff. I had an Americano and it was good. The best part is the modern interior, where you can rest and relax, catch up with your correspondence. Recommended."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-06-01,4.0,Why is this coffee so good?!!! The cappuccino is my favorite. They have all your various milk options too. The food is delicious: well flavored and portioned. They only lost a star because it takes them a long time to prepare the food and on occasions they have forgotten parts of my order. Not a huge deal since they are quick to fix the issues. It's also more expensive than the other options nearby.
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-11-26,4.0,"So... I go here once in a while on my way to work. I work below 50th street so on days I feel like being ""naughty"" and being ""late"" (past 8:30 am) to work, I stop by here to pick something up. Last time I had the most amazing lemon loaf. It was just my dreams in a cup, but they stopped having them. So I cried a bit. This morning, (with an attempt to go gluten free and healthier), I got this chocolate spelt loaf. I think it was gluten free... I never smiled for something that I've never tried before. I was smiling ear to ear because the person that was packing my loaf had a hard time getting the loaf in the wax paper bag because it was about to fall apart. Falling apart means, moist (sorry...) I walked to work all excited and giddy. Oh boy did this thing not disappoint. I took one bit and was so happy. Thank you Irving for meeting my expectations!"
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-07-11,3.0,"dropped by here for coffee in the morning since it was close to the hotel I was staying at... 

I got iced americano and avocado toast, which were okay... The avocado toast did not have a ton of flavors, tasted just the creamy avocado and a bit of mustard. The coffee was just normal, nothing special. I don't think I will go back unless I have to."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-12-22,5.0,Quaint coffee spot with delicious pour over coffee and hot chocolate!  Great selection of baked goods including gluten free breads/muffins/donuts/cookies!  The most amazing GF cheese bread poofs.  The market plate with bacon is an excellent choice for breakfast.

983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-01-10,2.0,"I love the convenience of having a solid sit-down coffee place around my office but there are some aspects of this place that leave me a bit cold. 

First, each time I step inside, I'm always hit with the desire to give everything a solid scrub-down. Floors are sticky; tables have small spills and leftover wrappers. I don't want to come off as the health inspector and I don't mind eating dumplings in a dingy Chinatown room but for a cafe where you want to catch up or read a book, ambiance matters a little to me. 

Second, on the few times I've been here, the baristas tend to treat the line like herding cattle. I understand that kind of attitude in Starbucks, where you need to keep the line and the flow of orders going or you'll be swamped, but, in the late afternoon, with maybe one or two people in line, there's absolutely no need to beckon impatiently and roll your eyes. 

Also, when I took a sip and realized that my latte contained regular milk rather than almond milk, the barista doubled down and absolutely insisted that I hadn't specifically requested for almond milk. Maybe I caught her on a bad day but the barista more or less flipped out and started banging things to show her displeasure at having to remake the drink. At that point, I would have preferred to just scrabble out of there with the wrong drink in hand. It was very strange. 

Two points for the amazing goat cheese and honey toast - the combination initially weirded me out but I changed my mind at the first bite."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-11-27,5.0,"I felt pretty comfortable here from the moment I walked in. Everyone else was in a suit, too. It's the neighborhood, I guess. I wonder why the baristas don't also wear suits. It is Midtown, after all. Maybe the staff is trying to appeal to the tourists. 

The space is cozy. The menu is in English, so that's a plus. 

I was really thirsty after my espresso so I stood near their water fountain for a while and drank a lot of water. I got the last clean cup. It was a ball jar, really. That seems a little off-brand for this part of town, too. I mean, my cousin that lives in Portland drinks out of ball jars. They have a lot of coffee there. Maybe it's a coffee thing. Do ball jars have anything to do with the coffee roasting process, I wonder?"
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2017-03-16,4.0,"I went to Irving Farm Coffee Roasters for a quick breakfast after working out. They have hearty and filling options for breakfast and lunch without being too heavy (breads, sandwiches, eggs, salads, and soups). The food options are fresh and relatively healthy. For example, I ordered the poached eggs and avocado. The avo smash came atop toasted sweet potato with two poached eggs on top. The avocado and poached eggs were seasoned well. Not too salty, but just enough to contrast the toasted sweet potatoes. One thing that I would critique is the texture of the dish. It was a lot of soft and mushy textures; I feel like some crunch would have helped. Though, that did not take away from the great flavours. 

Their coffee is excellent. They also serve lemonade, tea, hot cider, and hot chocolate.

I recommend Irving Farm for your daily fix of caffeine and/or for a fast but high quality brekkie."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-12-30,5.0,Oh wow! The ham and cheese croissant is amazing and so crisp and crunchy. It melts in your mouth. The coffee here is really good. I drink mine with cream and sugar but I could have drank this coffee black. It hit all my high notes!! Happy breakfast customer here!
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-06-03,2.0,"I used to love this place but as it keeps declining, I won't be returning. 

It used to have a great lunch menu, but they've shrunk the menu down substantially so now there are only a few items which are EXTREMELY overpriced. For example, the bacon egg and cheese sandwich is $9 and just has one egg, one piece of bacon, and one see-thru thin piece of cheese. The turkey sandwich has a decent amount of turkey but definitely not enough to warrant it being $11 - and if you want you can add a literally invisible piece of cheese for an additional $2. And even though it says it includes a side pickle, it does not. 

The coffee is relatively the same but the overall quality has also gone down. Very pricey, hardly any options, and typically served lukewarm. 

Also, this is a small annoyance but the hot lids don't fit properly flush on the cups so that there is almost always a little leak when you're drinking which I've learned the hard way by staining my clothes."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-10-24,4.0,"The place gets extremely crowded. They make pretty drinks but the taste is just OK. I prefer Bluestone lane or Joe Coffee. They take Ritual app and baristas are very friendly. They don't have milk out so if you need extra milk, you have to ask."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-02-08,4.0,Coffee joint with higher quality fare and reasonable New York prices. Ate the poached egg avocado on sweet potato. Very interesting combination and a great start to the day. Cappuccino was done well and the scone was great.

983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-01-31,3.0,"I feel bad giving this a 3 but it's mostly because of the toast I got. The ambiance is nice. It's a good spot for an intimate chat with friends and the apple cider was delicious. 

The service was not bad. They gave me a number after I ordered and brought my food to me. The literal only thing is that the toast killed me man. I might just not be sophisticated for a milk&honey smoked toast. It tasted really Smokey, like it was burnt but the after taste of it and the ""in season"" fruit were so hard. I guess I shouldn't try to eat fruit in the winter, but it was torture to finish it. The hot apple cider made it easier for sure."
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2019-11-05,1.0,It's overcrowded. They eliminated the WiFi in an unsuccessful effort to rediccrowding. It's puzzling because the coffee is mediocre at best. Food looks dreadful.

I decided on a chocolate bar near the register, to go with my latte.  With no price in sight, I figured, ""how much could it be? $3, $4?""  When the cashier said, ""your total is $18.95,"" I was dumbfounded.  I paid and moved along as the line behind me was long.

I asked the guy making my latte how much the chocolate bar was, still in shock from the snack that cost more than lunch.  He said they are $12.  I asked why the bars were $12 and he responded, ""why are you paying $6 for a latte?""  He said it was because they are ""artisanal.""  I said they should put an ""artisanal"" sign next to it so people know what they are getting into.

But you know what, Rude, you're right.  Why am I paying $6 for a latte that is half the size and double the price of what I could get at D&D or Starbucks.   Definitely didn't make a repeat customer out of me with that attitude.  As for the chocolate bar...#tasteslikeHersheys"
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2018-08-20,5.0,This is my new favorite coffee shop in the midtown area.  Food is absolutely top notch (have only tried breakfast foods) and the coffee is made with a professional flare that is becoming rare.  I have some special dietary requirements and they were not only accommodating but genuinely seemed happy to do so.  Check out this latte!  Artistry
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2017-02-28,5.0,"Sometimes you might want to just sit down and relax in a coffee shop, as opposed to simply grab-n-go. Irving Farm is definitely belonging to this camp. I'm so glad that it opened a new location in midtown east, just block away from my office. 

Unlike many other coffee shops in midtown, Irving Farm is pretty spacious and carried a somewhat chilled vibe. Really enjoyed my heartily prepared cappuccino!"
983,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-13,2017-12-01,5.0,"5-star cold brew at a 5-star place. Appreciate this cafe amongst the (mostly) coffee wasteland of midtown. Love the drinkability and strength of their cold brew, friendly staff, and spacious seating area. Plenty of tables so you're never sitting on top of someone else. Perfect for meeting up with a friend or colleague.

I grabbed a small plain coffee, added oat milk, & headed back to my hotel. The coffee was sooo acidic that the milk curdled by the time I got back to my room. It was so disappointing & I will not be back. Don't trust a coffee place that can't make coffee."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2020-02-22,5.0,"I have so much love for Argo Tea, but haven't been in so long! I finally made my way and was bummed that some of the teas I loved were out of stock! However, I found new ones to love! The staff was very nice and knowledgable and kept me informed about some of the teas I loved. Definitely the best spot for tea!"
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-12-31,4.0,"I LOVE Argo Tea because for once, there is a cafe where TEA and not coffee is the highlight (I hate coffee...haha). I don't even know if Argo sells coffee. 

Argo Tea was my favourite tea shop to visit when I lived in Chicago. Sadly, Argo is only in specific locations and their store is not located in my current city (Cleveland). They do sell bottled cold tea at CVS and perhaps other retailers but it's not the same as the in-store experience. 

Anyway, I came here on 20 October 2018 (mid-afternoon) when I was visiting NYC. I had just left Central Park and wanted to sit somewhere to relax.  I noticed that Argo Tea was in my vicinity right at the shops at Columbus Circle so I stopped in. 

TEAS - They have an expansive list of teas which is awesome. I normally order the Green Ginger tea but they were out of Ginger when I came. WHAT?!?! I was so disappointed. I don't even remember what I ended up ordering but I think it was a black tea. It actually tasted okay and it was nothing memorable. Alas! Sigh! LOL...no really, I was sad.  

INTERIOR - Medium size but not that big. There are tables and chairs to sit on with plug outlets for those who have their laptops. There is a bathroom inside too and a line started forming for it soon.

Overall, they did not have the tea that I wanted but service was good especially for a super busy day. When I visit Midtown again in NYC, I'll definitely stop by Argo Tea.

I was really hungry and indecisive, but Angel ensured the Brioche Sliders were a good choice. I came in for the Matcha Muffin (a fave of mine), but left with two sliders and the muffin. I highly recommend the Red Pepper Chicken and the Turkey Apple. Perfect little bites of heaven!!!! Thanks again Angel. I'll be back soon for my other fave- the Jasmine Lavender Half and Half."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-08-27,4.0,"Nice place to hangout or work for a couple of hours.They have free wifi and clean restrooms.
They have lots of varieties of tea and few sandwiches as well.I always try different teas when i am here.My favorites are the black tea coconut with and hibiscus tea sangria."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-06-10,4.0,"I was exploring the neighborhood on a rainy day and wanted something warm to drink. Argo Tea caught my eye and I decided to check it out! The interior is modern with a good amount of tables and couches. A lot of people were working on their laptops as the wifi inside was pretty fast. 

The menu had a variety of teas and a few coffee drinks. I just went with a warm green tea as I wasn't feeling too adventurous. This is probably the first store I've gone to that places greater emphasis on tea than coffee!"
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-08-19,4.0,"Pop in for Tea Time or anything and be wowed with the ambiance but more so, wowed by the customer service. A vibrant wall of tea welcomes you with the intertwining aromas. As you choose a delightful treat ask the employees for their opinion on what's good right now. The hibiscus lemonade tea is perfect for your sweet teen paired with a muffin for breakfast and the Americano with almond milk, iced hot the spot for me in this steamy summer day."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-07-19,3.0,"Underwhelming - I'm an avid tea drinker to make the understatement of the year. 

The line was long took about 5 minutes. When I got to the front I had to wait a few more while they were working on other orders. They then went to take the woman's order behind mine I pardoned and asked to give mine. They rang up the wrong item and then speedily fixed it before I paid. There were quite a few people behind the counter and they were communicating but they just seemed so swamped and there may have been one person training? Everyone was nice just takes a couple minutes. 

The tea itself is underwhelming it tasted watery. I usually brew my own and do not add anything as I enjoy tea. But I added a teaspoon of honey which helped some. Overall I'll probably not return."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-09-02,3.0,"There I was, by colombus circle, looking for boba tea to cap off a wonderful labor day weekend and suppress impending Sunday night blues. I was mildly dissapointed when I found out that Argo didn't have actual tapioca balls. Its ok, im flexible. I'll try their hip new trendy cocunut-something or other version. I got the mango mate which was a good level of sweetness and left me with a mild caffeine buzz. However, as is an issue I've come to find whenever I get bubble tea with non-round boba (theirs was the columnar shape ones, kinda like lichi, if you've seen them at other bubble tea places), I just could not get to all the goodies at the bottom before finishing my drink. So there I was looking like an oaf with no more tea, a cup of ice (far over half the cup...) and all their coconut goodness mocking me from the bottom of my overpriced tea ($6 not too bad, but not worth the price). 
Service was good though. I'm sure they get basic yelpers like me coming in expecting tapioca balls only to explain that they're too cool for them. They were patient with me and my emotional journey once I found out the reality of the tapioca-less situation I had just found myself trapped in. Quick service too. I'd like to go again, maybe just try something other than their fauxba*.

*fake bubble tea that ain't the business"
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-07-03,2.0,"Every morning I either go starbucks, juicy cube, or Paris baguette so today I decided try something new and bring in to my friends at work. 

On yelp reviews people have said the apple cider is pretty good so I got that and tried it! 
I couldn't use straw due to tooth extraction so I open the lid which I find dead mosquitoes on my drink on the fruit! 

The girl who works there gave us medium size drink and without apples!
Since it happened to me today with dead mosquitoes on my drink check before drinking it! 
It felted like the fruits aren't fresh.. from there I was disappointed. 

I brought eight drinks through mobile order and the girl is like are you sure this is right.. it seemed like no body order like that. She asked me if I clicked by accident? Haha

I brought the jasmine tea mosa that was sampled in front. I tried it and it was good! When I ordered through mobile order it was just very disappointment! 
It didnt tasted same as what I tasted with the sample! Very sad!!!
The orange wasn't ripe! It was too bland, just too light. 
Most of the drinks I had ordered for my friends they said the hibiscus drink were just too sweet. 

It was my first time being there and when I tasted dge jasmine tea mosa I wanted to give them a good review but it was very disappointing with them today.

Overall it was sad experiencing with them and will rethink about coming here.
Maybe there's another chance.. 
See you next time."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-06-22,3.0,"Basically, don't go here for food. 

Placed an online order for a roasted tomato sunrise panini ~$5 (Swiss cheese, egg, roasted tomatoes). Went to pick it up and the lady at the register said it was my sandwich. It was all smooth until I was about 4 blocks away and checked my sandwich to see that there was no egg- it was literally just tomato and cheese. Of course now I'm frustrated so I go back and the lady at the register said she purposely did not include the egg because she was being careful because sometimes people don't realize there's an egg in the sandwich. I literally wanted to be like WTF? How does that make sense? I gave no indication that I didn't want an egg, and every description of the sandwich says WITH EGG. Anyways, she added it in in the end. Also the sandwich was dry AF-- they need to add some dressing/sauce to the bread since it's so dense."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-04-06,3.0,"I'm a sucker for Argo's seasonal drinks. The Oolong Coconut was being offered at this location, so I had to try it. It was pretty refreshing with a nice kick to it. 

The service here is friendly and patient, and they gladly offer samples for whatever you are curious about. 

This location is extremely busy and not the cleanest, so it can be annoying to find a seat. When you do, the tables are very cramped next to each other. There's not a shortage of outlets, so literally everyone is here with their laptops or tablets working away. It's not very cozy and the WiFi didn't work when I was there, but there's a bathroom, and in a very barren area, Argo provides a cheap cafe to hang in and relax for a bit."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-12-07,1.0,"Disastrous. I needed to repeat my order to the cashier three times and gave my name as requested. After waiting ten minutes, they screamed out the order but without the name. All the people waiting did not know which tea belonged to which customer. Why didn't they call my name??
The worst part was the bathroom. It was utterly filthy. The toilet was disgusting, the toilet paper roll was on the floor, which was sticky. Clearly no one has cleaned this bathroom fir hours. What a disgrace!"
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-08-30,4.0,Every time I'm around this location I always order coconut black tea and it never disappoints me... it is delicious... definitely if your around need to stop at this place...
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-07-28,5.0,"This place blew me away. Hot day, looking for an iced tea. Starbucks tea is mediocre at best, but they're everywhere. 

Saw this place on the corner and it caught my attention. Ordered the Mojitea (absolutely excellent. Super refreshing, light, and some excellent flavors without being awfully sweet. 

Also, their chai that they had for tasting was fantastic. Far FAR superior to the powdered crap they seem to have everywhere else, and not as sugary sweet as Starbucks. 

It's a little more, but so worth it."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-11-18,1.0,The worst chai teas I've had! My friend ordered a regular chai with almond milk and it was so sour that I almost spit it out. I ordered a chestnut chai and it was $6. I felt so cheated because it tasted really bad. :( They also need better hospitality service by cleaning up and wiping off the tables and floors if someone spilled something and gets all everything all sticky.
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-01-28,5.0,"Ok, so it's Sunday... and despite getting ""cold coffee""  served to me and my female friend..,we ordered some of the food.

    I had the Ham + Egg Breakfast Panini Sandwich on this Herb Bread., by which I'll give it  6.0 for quality. 

    Then we ordered the Spinach Brioche and we gave it a 5.5.  It could have been larger for the price.......,but remember it is New York City Columbus Circle Manhattan. 

    Great area for a date...,and the seating area for soft quiet conversations."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-07-30,5.0,I have gone to basically all Argo locations in the city for many years and it never disappoints. Really good tea options. Not your standard tea-- they are all flavorful. Seating area is quiet and relaxing.
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-12-30,4.0,"Big fan of the fruit sangria tea! 

Wish this place had better heating. It's late December and I could not take my coat off how cold it was even while drinking warm tea :( 

Nice place overall to have a chat over tea or coffee or get some work done on a laptop/read a book."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-11-07,1.0,"This place is so delicious and employees are usually very nice. It is a shame that some of them are not at the level of other. Today, Sadia rudely and sarcastically gave me what she thought I wanted.

A cup of tea should come as I ordered not as how you believe I will appreciate it, that's why I choose to pay $5 dollars for a cup of tea at Argo and not $2 at Starbucks."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-05-11,1.0,"I ordered bubble tea and sandwiches for breakfast on Ubereats. About 45 minutes later, my Ubereats driver called me to inform me that half of my order is missing and he told the restaurant to complete the order. How can these people that work in restaurants continue to mess up your orders yet still remain employed. Anyway, bravo to the Ubereats driver. Thumbs down on this place.  Update: later the same day - I ordered 2 egg sandwiches from this place. I received 2 sandwiches with swiss and no eggs. How can a restaurant offer an egg sandwich on their menu and forget to add the main item??? After spending a few days in NY and out of all orders from different restaurants (4) only 1 was 100% correct. How sad is that? This is how ""smart"" we have become, me excluded."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2017-06-26,4.0,"What a great spot for tea-lovers!! 

I was in the area and needed to get some work done. Picking Argo Tea over the local Starbucks was a great life decision. Their tea menu is EXPANSIVE, with your bread and butter options and what I would call ""fun drinks"". I opted for what seemed like the ""funnest"" drink, their Tea Sangria. The drink had fresh fruit bits in a cup of sweet Hibiscus Tea. It felt like the real deal and I swear I felt a little buzzed afterwards (most likely a placebo effect). 

The space itself is spacious and not overly crowded. I came in on a Sunday afternoon and was able to easily find a spot at the communal table to work. Great lighting and free wi-fi!"
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2017-11-26,4.0,"If you're looking for all natural, real ingredients, and smart calories. This is the place for you. 

They have tea for everyone which I love because I don't drink coffee. They have specialty drinks as well like mochas and frapputeanos...I don't know if that's what hey call them but hey should! 

They have snacks as well so you can get an entire breakfast, lunch, or afternoon snack there!!! Yummy!!

It is by far my favorite place to come to when I'm in NYC...they have every type of milk you could imagine; whole, 2%, 1%, skim, almond, coconut and soy...you name it, they have it!!!

The only down side is their bathroom, it's only one stall and there's always a line and it's not a nice bathroom it's functional and that's it. 

Overall though, I love this place!"
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-04-08,4.0,It was my first time going there and it happened to be at the teapucino happy hour where some of the tea drinks are for $2.  The sign in store is misleading as it is that price with app and a credit card on it.  The supervisor patiently explained but I was exasperated and decided to just get a cookie for my son.  A few minutes later a worker came by and gave me the drink I ordered for free.  Nice job as I would not have written this review otherwise! The mint chocolate tea drink was great!
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-11-08,1.0,"I just went to this place for a cup of hot tea to take back to my hotel two blocks away. They appear to use pre-brewed tea. And I saw the clerk put an ice cube in two cups of to-go teas. I assumed it couldn't be ours, but indeed she handed them to me. So by the time I got to my hotel it was barely warm. I will never go back to an Argo Tea. Ever."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2017-10-17,4.0,"The short: awesome tea spot near Columbus circle. This spot is perfect for tea lovers or people who don't want to want to deal with the crowded coffee spots in the area. 

The longer: I was walking to the 1 train, and was dying for a cold beverage. I popped into Argo, and was so pleasantly surprised. I don't drink coffee, so this place was heaven for me. 

They had 2 single tastings available for free. I tasted an unsweetened black Indian tea, Darjeeling, and loved it. I would definitely, definitely be back here to try some of their other iced teas. I also got a raw blueberry chia bar. It was delicious, but I couldn't find the nutritional information anywhere... which was kind of a bummer. 

Overall, awesome tea spot. Comfy amounts of seating. I'll be back!"
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-05-08,5.0,"I am a constant customer at Argo Tea during my third trimester this spring! Lots of variety, a great way to stay hydrated, and a nice walk from my office. They put out samples to try which are often the sweeter/milkier teas that I wouldn't order a whole cup of.

The app is great. You can order from the subway and it'll be ready for pickup when you get there.

Favorites include: Armenian mint, hibiscus apple and coconut oolong. They can custom brew any of their multitude of varieties, it just takes a few minutes."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2017-06-24,2.0,"I ordered the large matcha latte for $5.75 after tax and my SO ordered a medium coffee for $3.

I regret ordering the matcha latte. It came out in a timely manner and the color of the actual latte looked normal, but it honestly had no matcha flavor whatsoever. I wasn't even sure if I ordered a matcha latte until I opened the cap to see it green. I just paid $6 for warmed up milk? No thanks.

As much as I despise Starbucks, I would rather go there for their green tea latte. That's how bad my latte at Argo was.

The coffee was average, but I expected that for a tea shop."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-09-30,1.0,"A friend and I were near Columbus Circle and decided to give this place a try. Partly because we wanted to sit and have a cold drink that wasn't alcoholic, but mostly because it looked welcoming from the outside.

I ordered a large mojitea and my buddy got a sambuca tea, or whatever crap it was. Crap was the best word to describe the service and taste of the tea we both received.

My friend got his drink first, and I kept waiting...and waiting...and waiting, and I never got my receipt while my friend did. Not a big deal normally but I also had to use the bathroom, of which, it needed a code. So I took my bud's receipt for the code to use the bathroom, thinking my tea was going to take a lot of time to make. I returned out in 2 minutes, and I'm still waiting for my tea.

A female coworker asked me what I was waiting for. I said that I'm waiting on a large mojitea. Apparently, while I was taking a piss, they completely forgot my order! Despite me waiting 4 minutes before going to the bathroom...DESPITE ME PAYING FOR MY DRINK! A $5 piece of shit lemonade with some seltzer in it, mind you.

I should've just drank own urine for free instead of paying $5 for the same thing, to go along with crap customer service.

Hate your job! CHANGE IT! For potential customers, go somewhere else because your drink will be flat and expensive."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2017-04-25,2.0,"Friendly service.
Got a chai with vanilla and bubbles. Came to $6, which is a little pricey, but it tastes really good.
Unfortunately, the bubbles this time were so chewy that I had spit them out several times...like I actually cound not chew them!

That didn't happen last time when I was at another location.
*sigh*"
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-12-01,5.0,"This was an excellent place to get out of the rain and enjoy a hot cup of tea.  I tried their Earl Gray and found it to be deliciously nuanced.  This was far superior to the tea bag tea that the chain coffee places offer as an afterthought.  The service was professional and friendly. 

I would certainly return to Argo Tea."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-05-17,3.0,"Free Wi-Fi. Not that much seating, but a few plugs if you sit in the right spot. 

Hint: Do not combine mint kombucha with vanilla syrup with the build-your-own kombucha option. Tastes gross.

Even Better Hint: Switch out your gross mint-vanilla kombucha for coconut black bubble tea."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-05-01,1.0,"To put it briefly, the ""bubble tea"" was nasty.

The ""bubbles"" are not bubbles at all. Instead of boba (which is a yummy chewy black tapioca ball), they have some kind of sugary jelly which reminded me more of a hardened cube of jello. The whole drink tasted like syrup.

Would not recommend at all, if you're looking for bubble tea."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2018-08-24,3.0,"I did not like bubble tea. I got the Green Tea Raspberry Bubble Tea. The boba was raspberry flavor and square, which I have never had. It was too sweet. Workers were very friendly here!"
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2017-11-27,3.0,This place is very clean very roomy very colorful and bright. They are making all kind of freshly brewed teas here and you can order all kind of dessert to go alone with it even my favorite macaroons. I  ordered green tea raspberry with Nata de Coco jellies in size medium. Price wasn't bad $ 5.15 but something about that mixture didn't get alone with me plus that jellies they were so fake tasting and so sweet and barista put so much of it that my mouth felt clustered. Not a happy experience
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2019-08-21,1.0,"Almost all the other Argo locations in NYC have closed, but this spot has always been the worst one. The employees are rude, slow, and they do not seem to observe basic levels of hygiene. The space is small and uncomfortable. I don't understand why this location is still open."
984,argo-tea-new-york-2,2015-02-23,4.0,"I love Argo tea! They have soy milk to make their beverages vegan. They also have vegan baked goods such as muffins and cookies, and they also have a RAW date bar! They usually have some samples of tea sitting out for you to try. 

This location is right near columbus circle, so it is easy to access. The decor was bright & inviting-- great place to hang out in NYC. Always a nice change from a coffeeshop to see a place dedicated to tea-based drinks!"

Hibiscus apple cider is my favorite.  They even put a few slices of green apple in it.  It's light and refreshing.  The service is great.  By the 3rd cup,  the cashier remembered my name already. Lol!  Lots of seating area too, looking out Columbus Circle. I wish I could come here more often."

It's not hard to be distracted by Ovenly (and I might  go in that way on purpose but that's besides the point). The point is, try this cookie! It's not your average snickerdoodle, it uses ""pecan fluff"" which is usually tossed in the pecan chopping process. It's pecan-licious and cinnamon and lovely in that oh-so-Ovenly way."
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2020-03-02,4.0,"Five stars for the cookies!! DELISH! Thank you for creating these heavenly bits of joy! The hot chocolate is to die for, so long as you are a chocolate lover (of which, I am). One star was lost for the terrible service. The woman that took our order had a touch of arrogance and impatience. She didn't greet us, or answer our questions, when we asked again, she was annoyed to have to open her mouth to answer and no other words were exchanged. Rude. She should not be working in a customer service position. Despite this hiring flaw, I will likely be back because the cookies were that good! Only Wishing I could find these tasty treats in Manhattan!"
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2019-09-23,2.0,Kind of disappointed here. I got the caramel brownie and it was very mediocre. They didn't have a wide selection of pastries. The girl behind the counter was pretty rude and unwelcoming.
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2019-01-11,4.0,"At this point I've had their chocolate chip cookie, brownie, ginger molasses, salted caramel brownie, and aged provolone & serrano ham croissant sandwich. I've got to say they are all consistently good. I've never had the issues of ""hard"" cookies or other issues like some Yelpers previously have complained about. I do wish they would heat the aged provolone and serrano ham croissant but if you're like me and work in the area, you can just heat it up in your work's kitchen. 

Staff is always friendly and quick, which I appreciate. 

Tip: They typically have some samples of one of their baked goods out so have one if you're unsure! They also do punch cards (9 and the 10th is free) so make sure you get one if you work in the area and come to Urbanspace often."
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2019-06-17,4.0,Cold brew was good! The blackout cup cake so black lol. Still couldn't figure out the flavour but it's sweet and looks bomb!
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2020-03-02,5.0,I visited Ovenly during a weekend trip to NY and the brownies are to die for! They're so chewy and chocolatey just how they're supposed to be made. I recommend!
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2019-03-17,5.0,"Fantastic little bakery. Ovenly is a well respected local brand in NYC, and this location does not disappoint.

The vegan chocolate chip cookies are my favorite and I'm not even Vegan. The salted peanut butter are a close second. The blackout cake is heaven in slice form. So moist and delicious. I was there last week and Tanisha helped me with my selections she was so pleasant and informative. I was going to buy an odd number of cookies but she informed me it was a better deal for me to get even numbers as they offer 2 for deals! I also love that they are right by the door so You don't have to walk through the crowds of people. 
This is definitely a spot to stop at and treat yo' self."

Edit 10/2018: brownies are so good!"

985,ovenly-new-york-2,2018-10-05,5.0,"Ovenly is one of those special NYC bakeries that has a ton of heart and enthusiasm. It's very entrepreneurial, and a woman-owned business, and, my god, her story of how much of herself she put into this place to get it off the ground when it first started is so sweet and inspiring! Truly a labor of love! I am so passionate about supporting local spots like these. 

I love their burnt sugar shortbread, salted caramel cupcakes, and ginger molasses cookies. But seriously, anything you get from there is totally delish. Fair prices, friendly service, and best of all, fresh and made from scratch. Plus they have buy one get one free deals right before closing, just ask."
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2019-11-21,5.0,My favorite cookies and cakes. The peanut butter cookie is to for for. The blackout cake is decadent and not too too sweet.

The flavors blend perfectly, and you can taste each individual flavor. The cupcake was moist and doesn't have that ""gluten-free"" taste at all. Love this! I wish I could get a second one, but since I snagged the last one, I'll have to come back next time. 

This little bakery counter is really hard to find though, and shares the space and seating with hip restaurants and bars that makes it really loud and hard to find seating."
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2017-09-16,1.0,"You can barely taste the salted caramel in the salted caramel brownie. There's nothing special about this overpriced brownie. I took one bite and couldn't go on. 
It's fudgier and richer than your generic brownie, but it's way too sweet and doesn't live up to it's name."
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2019-09-16,5.0,A+ bakery here for everyday cookies and special occasion treats. Love the peanut butter cookie. I get down with the caramel brownie. We need more consistently good businesses like this in this part of town.
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2018-04-27,5.0,"Overall rating: A+

Located within Urbanspace Vanderbilt. Right by the entrance! They only accept credit cards (no cash)! I got 2 of their chewy ginger molassescookies. They are hands down the BEST ginger molassescookies I've ever had! It had a really nice ginger flavor. I hate it when bakeries skimp on the ginger flavor. It was perfectly chewy with the crunch coming from the sugar on top. It was still so delicious, especially given it was after 5pm and baked good tend to go stale later on! A++ 

Things I want to try in the future:
-Carrot ginger cake + honey buttercream
-Pistachio cardamom cake + cocoa buttercream (gluten free)
-Espresso burnt sugar shortbread

Pro Tip: They also have a loyalty card. Buy 10 treats, get one free. They punch your card PER ITEM vs per visit at other places. 

Bonus: They discount their items after 5pm or so. I read a sign about cake happy hour (2 for $10) but no mention of exact time. Sadly, there was only one cake option left when I got there and I wasn't keen on the flavor. Maybe next time! Also, my cookies usually are $3.25 each but I got 2 for $5.50 total ($2.75 each)! Nothing better than a discounted yummy treat!"
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2018-01-31,4.0,"I've visited Ovenly's Greenpoint shop and this Urbanspace Vanderbilt outpost.  No preference for one or the other.  I just float to whichever one is closer.  My most recent purchases have been their Brooklyn Blackout cake, seasonal Caramel Apple cake, and vegan chocolate chip cookie.  I went late so I was stuck with the last slice of The Brooklyn Blackout.  It was a better deal to purchase two rather than one slice of cake, so I tacked on the Caramel Apple cake, which appeared to be the less popular option.  Brooklyn Blackout was good.  After a few mouthfuls, it started to taste like an Oreo cookie.  I was hoping for a bitter dark chocolatey cake (I like 80% dark chocolate bars), but it isn't grossly sugary like Martha's Country Bakery or Carlo's Bakery.  Most conventional cake eaters will enjoy this cake's level of sweetness.  Caramel Apple cake was too sweet but very moist and had a delicious perhaps cream cheesy (?) frosting.  Vegan chocolate cookie was excellent.

They had tons of other great looking desserts (eggnog cookie sandwich, sticky donut cake, everything croissant, salted caramel brownies, salted peanut butter cookies, maybe a ginger cookie, pistachio cardamom bread, whole wheat flax banana bread, olive oil pumpkin bread, cupcakes, and gluten free or other vegan options) but I already had my hands and stomach full from my order.  Grab a punch card so you can buy 10 baked goods and get 1 free (probably a cookie).  The goods are expensive for what you get so I have to dock a star. 

Service is friendly, fantastic, and most importantly, patient.  A+ for the counter girl who was working that Wednesday night in January 2018.  She will ensure you feel like a valued customer."
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2019-08-22,1.0,"The worst desserts I've ever had! And Im a person who really loves anything sweet and rarely thinks dessert is bad. That's why I was excited to try these. Tried a few things in hopes that one was good but NOPE! So gross! I mean how does one have a business and sell the worst cookies I've ever had. Those should be the simple things you can make. And everyone makes vegan nowadays which are not as bad as these so that's not an excuse. Threw everything away after a quick taste of each hoping something would be edible. 
I'm stunned they are in business honestly, especially in NYC when there are so many better bakeries. Don't waste your time."
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2019-03-13,5.0,"Ovenly blew me away with their pastries! I always thought another bakery in LES would forever be my favorite, but Ovenly's salted choco chip cookies, salted pb cookies, and everything croissants completely blew me out of the water! Their pistachio cardamom bread is good too, but a bit heavier as it reminds me of halva and middle eastern sweets which tend to be rather dense. Their pumpkin bread is delicious and moist, though I find it rather greasy? If you like massive amounts of chocolate, then their hot choco cookie can't be beat! I tend to go for the savory-sweet goodies, and so the salted choco chip cookie and pb cookies are perfect; they have good sized salt chunks that give you that UMPH with every bite! I wish they'd have normal croissants (without the savory everything toppings), but I have yet to find those!  I will definitely be keeping an eye out for their other goodies (I got my eye on you, sticky donut)!"
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2018-03-02,4.0,"Delicious cookies that are gluten free! 

I had their sticky donut which was amazing, it's less of a donut and more like a cinnamon sticky bread- nonetheless very delicious and so satisfying. The cookie are amazing and one of my favorite gluten free cookies. I have had their chocolate chip, hot chocolate and ginger molasses cookie. I would recommend all, whatever you are in the mood for! Go for it! I have to say the hot chocolate cookie was so good- one was not enough. These are the best chewy cookies if you're craving for one!!  Can't wait to go back to get more cookies!

985,ovenly-new-york-2,2017-06-29,3.0,"I was pretty sad when I found out my salted chocolate chip cookie had only 2-3 pieces of chocolate. It's a ""salted"" cookie so the salty was a given, but it was way too salty for my taste. And on top of that, the cookie was past the point of perfect chewiness - it was pretty hard so I felt like I was giving my jaw a workout. Consequently my chocolate chip cookie experience here was sub-par.

However, I do see a light of hope for the other treats offered at Ovenly. For instance, I tried their salted brownie samples and they tasted amazing! I look forward to coming back and getting the brownie next time."
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2018-09-14,1.0,"Terrible customer service. No one was in line. I wanted to buy a coffee and pastry and the cashier said ""I'll be with you in one sec."" I then wait for at least 3 minutes while she continues to pack to-go orders for an online order. 

She could have taken 1 minute to serve the customer who was right in front of her. When I said politely, ""I'll come back in a few minutes when you are free"", she just said ""ok"" without looking. 

Ovenly had lost my business going forward."
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2017-10-10,3.0,"Solid 3.5.

I was under the impression that they would have more vegan options. I'm not entirely sure but as far as I know they only have vegan banana chocolate chip muffin and salted chocolate chip cookie. I tried the salted chocolate chip cookie. The first thing I noticed was how SMALL and THIN it is. Taste? The cookie has a perfect balance of sweetness and saltiness. Texture? It was chewy and soft. There were plenty of semi-sweet chocolate bits. To many people this may just be the perfect cookie but I'm really not dying to go back for another. For over $3 I was expecting more. I'm not sure if I want to try the banana muffin either."

I've tried their Brooklyn Blackout cake and their chocolate chip cookies (which happen be vegan if that matters to you). Both were delicious. To be honest, I expected the Brooklyn Blackout to be just a regular chocolate cake with a clever name, but it's truly ""black"".  It also has an interesting depth of flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Stout maybe?  

The girl working there was very friendly and patiently waited while I made up my mind on what to order. Next time, maybe I'll try one of the other more unique options. There was another cake that intrigued me. I think it was matcha coconut."

I was looking for a sweet and ran into UrbanSpace for one.

I am constantly reminded why I don't come here. Their offerings are mediocre and the prices are insane. I rarely come here for a sweet because everything is so sub-par and expensive, I don't understand the love.

For $2, I could have eaten 2 delicious chocolate chip cookies from Cucina & Co. Instead, I paid $5.50 for 2 hard as rock cookies with sea salt."

985,ovenly-new-york-2,2018-03-14,3.0,"Good but not great baked goods. We tried the blackout cupcake and the salted chocolate chip cookie. Both were perfectly good - moist with reasonable (or perhaps unreasonable) helpings of chocolate. My problem is that there didn't seem to be anything special going on. Like, they were perfectly good for what they were? But I'm not sure why I would go here unless I was already in the food hall for something else. Certainly not a bad choice, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
985,ovenly-new-york-2,2018-03-31,2.0,"I really wanted to like Ovenly. I tried a few things and was not impressed. I was with a friend and we split a caramel brownie, which had good flavor, but was totally mushy. I prefer a bit of chew to a brownie. If they changd the texture of this item it would be great.

The chocolate chip cookie was small for the price and very bland and boring. It kind of tasted like dough. Again, I think it was a texture issue for me

We had a scone (I'm not a fan, but my friend wanted one) and it was totally dry. My scone-loving friend didn't like it and didn't finish it.

The blackout cake looked good, but we didn't get it.  I would try it if I found myself here again, but overall, I would not most likely return."

He said the cookies at this place are not worth trying, but they do have real milk for you to enjoy with your cookies.  I ordered the Salted Caramel brownie, it's $3.75.  The brownie was good, it's rich, gooey and refreshing with the salted caramel added.  It's definitely a great idea to grab a dessert here after eating at one of the places at Urbanspace Vanderbilt or after a happy hour next door."

The spot is small , but service is fast and we tried two flavors : Black gold  with a Brownie batter and cookie crumble topping; and my personal favorite : Chandonut made with Chandon Rose - and it was amazing ! A really subtle but lovely rose taste!

The donuts were delicious and fresh and the prices were excellent for what you get! Well worth a visit !"
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2020-02-03,3.0,"I bought a box of donuts to try out variety and we had:
The Bronx / olive oil and black pepper. The flavor grows on you. May not be love at first sight but with a good cup of coffee it was a worthy contender.  Very creamy on the palate. 
Black Gold was a bit dry for my taste, the chocolate is a bit overpowering not something i would order again. 
Those beets are dope /  ricotta filling with the beet juice topping, soft pillow donut a nice treat all on its own.
Lemon love letter / lemon flavor donut, a bit too sweet could benefit from less sugar and more acidity.
Chocolate old fashion / felt more like a chocolate browny; i am not a chocolate lover so for me it was too much chocolate flavor.  Overpowering had to have a cup of black coffee to wash it down.
Clearly bring a credit card this was close to $20 for 5 donuts..Honey this ain't dunkin donuts..lol"

WHAT

It's impossible not to love The Doughnut Project with their wonderful spectacular and extremely sweet doughnuts. They're in the same boat as Dough, Doughnut Plant, and Dun Well, the golden trinity of the sensational types of Donuts that NYC sort of invented.

My day began at this really excellent donut shop that picks up right where Doughnut Plant and Dough left off with delicious fluffy donuts with fancy extravagant toppings and ridiculously high prices. I have no qualms about giving them five stars because the guy was so adorable and so friendly and he insisted I get the espresso milk chocolate donut and it was absolutely delicious. It didn't blow me away like Dough and Doughnut Plant did the first time I had them, and I ended up throwing half of it away, but I could have easily finished the whole thing because it was absolutely delicious and definitely worthfive stars. I think I'm just used to these levels of amazing donuts now, is why. I think it's as good as DP and Dough were when they came out.

So, in summary - absolutely delicious and continuing the tradition of perfect New York Donuts. Next time I want to try the lemon one. Very happy that the guy insisted on the espresso and might I also add that he was the nicest person in all of Manhattan today and so infectiously happy. And into me.

This was my first location - I loved both. The service at both places is excellent with really nice employees and this one has even nicer and more rustic village-esque decor.

They also we're not sold out of the big selling doughnuts so I just tried the famous Lemon and honestly it was a little sweet for me but it was also absolutely delicious. I passed it off to my lemon-loving BFF.

Definitely some of the berry best Donuts (I meant to say very, but I'm sure the berry ones are great too) in New York City and we're talking about a glowing endorsement in the best city for donuts in the world so that's a hell of a statement - and I've tried all the best ones, too.

So forget the Dom Ansel Cronuts
And stop trying to fondle your bronuts
I'll tell you right now
If you wanna say wow
Then come to the Project for Doughnuts!"
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-09-26,5.0,"After a long morning of walking around New York City, I needed an afternoon pick me up. In search of coffee, I found this place just a short walk away nestled in between Central Park and my hotel. 

I ordered a caramel iced latte and it was AMAZING. Seriously- this place is good for more than just doughnuts! They also used strapless lids, which I appreciated. 

Of course we had to order doughnuts as well. Since it was mid-afternoon, their selection wasn't very big as many flavors had sold out. The staff recommended the Strawberry Milkshake and Lemon Love Letter doughnut, so we tried those. They were both really good! They were sweet and melted in your mouth. Pretty big size for a doughnut too! I would love to come back in the morning and try some of the other flavors.

As there is no seating inside, we walked the short distance to Central Park and found a nice bench to enjoy our coffee and doughnuts. This is definitely a place I would recommend for a nice afternoon pick me up."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-07-22,3.0,"Yeah you guested it, I did try the Bacon Maple Bar, what was I thinking ?  And no I don't drink or do other stuff that may impact my brain's cognitive abilities. Oh well what's done is done.

I ate most of it and the maple coating was way to sweet and you can't even taste the bacon most of the time at all. You only notice the bacon when you feel the crunchy bacon in your mouth and hear your teeth crunching down on it.

I actually like bacon with pancakes or waffles and I put maple syrup on it too, but it wasn't the same. And the doughnut dough was very heavy and doughy It was a big elongated doughnut and the novelty worn off after the first bite."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-06-23,4.0,"June 23, 2019 I was a woman on a mission. Find The Donut Project and have the Everything Donut. Round trip from my apartment it's about four miles. I was prepared to Yelp my way down there and be back home in time for my favorite afternoon Sunday Television Shows. 

Naturally when I hit the door I was alarmed at how tiny the place was. I didn't care if I had to go sit on the bus bench. It's conveniently located outside their door. In addition the subway that goes to my neighborhood is right outside their door! 

So immediately a smiling employee helped me with my selection. All the while answering my questions. I went with the box for my Donut because they don't have plates. That's a waste. They do have a very narrow counter where you can eat. If there's a line of customers it's definitely in a bad place. I found a little tiled area by the window near the coffee fixing area. It worked fine for me to put my bag down and sit to enjoy my donut. 

Enjoy is the key word! While the icing was a little sweeter than I expected, it was delicious. For $3.75 I believe it's the least expensive of their donuts. I'm not sure I would get this flavor again. I do want to try others that look and sound delicious. My Yelp Friends have recommended their favorite flavors to me. 

So all you need to know is:
1. Smiling Employees 
2. Clean colorful fun atmosphere. 
3. Delicious specialty donuts. 
4. Reasonable price for the quality. 

Minus a star for comfort while you eat, no WIFI, cramped when entering and exiting. 

In the end I forgot to check in until I was down the street. I was just too darned excited. I had made a plan for my beautiful weather day and reached my goal. Another business off my bucket list! I highly recommend The Donut Project if you're nearby. Another perk, it's very close to Central Park."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-05-30,4.0,"This was our second doughnut experience in New York, and definitely our favorite of the two. We found this one after having a less than wow-worthy other doughnut adventure, and this one went above and beyond in flavor.

We got to the location early to get a good selection before they sold out for the day. the ones we selected were: Lemon poppy seed old fashioned which was brightly citrus and dense, Chandonut Rose which was lightly flavored and fluffy, Black Gold which was my favorite and had the perfect mix of creamy chocolate and salty brownie, Lemon Love Letter which was his favorite and was equal parts citrus and pillow-y goodness, and Tullamore Dewnut which was whiskey and espresso, and was not really that good compared to the others in my opinion.

The downside was the service. We were the only ones there when we walked in, and for some reason, the two sales people behind the small counter were more interested in watching movies on their phone, than providing customer service and answering questions. I understand my concept of interacting with strangers is different from how New Yorkers do things, but they were pretty cold, rude, and dismissive. Nevertheless, the doughnuts were worth it.

By far the stand out doughnuts were the Lemon Love Letter and Black Gold. We probably could have gone through two each of those and been totally fat and happy. I also really wanted to try the bone marrow doughnut which sounded like it could be fantastic, but they didn't have any the day we went there. Overall, worth the stop despite the non-existent customer service."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-06-11,4.0,"Where should I start with this place.  Doughnuts was one of the things on my list to have while in NY.  Normally I am not a big doughnut fan but this place was amazing. It's a small place, kind of tucked in with a lot of other shops.  Easy to walk by and not notice it's there. 

My friends and I ended up getting 3 different flavors so we can try different ones.  We ended up getting the Matcha,  Blueberry and Strawberry milkshake.  All of them tasted good.  The Matcha one was a little too much on the sweet side but I loved it and tasted like Matcha.  The other two were equally good as well.  If you are around this place, you will definitely have to try it!"

Picked up the Whiskey & Espresso one and inhaled it. So soft that it basically melted in my mouth. The aroma of the coffee flavor smelled sooooooo good omg I'm so impressed. Didn't have to pay for it this time around but will def come back because $4 for that piece of heaven is 100% worth it."

986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-10-11,3.0,"A bit overhyped in my opinion. I tried the ricotta/beet, peanut butter/blackberry jam and sparkling rosé. Nothing stood out. The dough itself was average on the drier side. They weren't too sweet and the flavors were very light almost not noticible. If you're trying many flavors at once, you will need a pallet cleanser like coffee. I wouldn't recommend this place for a donut fix."

I've tried donut from another shop of the same name but the one located in Chelsea. I notice the selections here are different than the onee in Chelsea. either they do have more options or the franchise just add more selections. we got the The Everything Donut and the Fronuts Cold Brew because they look interesting. 

- the Fronuts were cold donut with coffee glazing and coffee cream filling. my friends love it, but I don't know it doesn't really stand out for me. the texture of the dough was good though, but other than that I don't find it special and I don't see myself craving it. for me it just tastes like regular sweet donut with coffee fragrance
- The Everything Donut was literally like a donut version of bagel with the glazing made of cream cheese but like very sweet and topped with toasted black and white sesame seeds. I think it wasn't too bad but both of my friends absolutely hate it. they find it weird. i think it's okay, but again, maybe it's personal preferences

the donut was pretty expensive compared to other donuts but not necessarily better taste-wise so I don't know. i don't see myself coming back here anytime soon :( however the texture of the donut was great and the store looks pretty hip"

986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2020-03-11,5.0,I walked three miles round trip for a doughnut... it was well worth it. This place is small and on a small street but it was easy to find and so delicious!
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-01-12,3.0,"I donut know about this place...but I do know I smell donuts. 

I am usually on the hunt for a donut shop, especially when I'm in NYC. But on this trip, I was showing my friend around and didn't get a chance to hit all my donut shops or try any new ones. It was so strange because we were looking for something to eat and we literally ran into this place. Well, it's like we ran into each other, it was kind of like fate. The Doughnut Project is a small shop but as long as they had donuts I wasn't going to complain. I can't lie, I was a little disappointed at the selection. There was only like 8 flavors of donuts and I usually like more choices. However, my biggest problem wasn't the selection, it was the taste. I prefer my donuts to be as fresh as possible. They didn't taste stale but fresh and hot is usually the goal. I got 4 donuts:

-Lemon Love Letter: I didn't care for it but my friend liked it. 
-The Bronx: Yes this one was a winner. Delicious 
-The Chandonut: Pretty good, definitely tasted interesting. 
-The Everything Donut: It tasted just like an everything bagel, so strange but surprisingly good. A bagel and a donut all in one. I liked it but my friend thought it tasted weird. 

These donuts aren't cheap and they run $4/$5 each. 
I wouldn't be against going back and trying more of their flavors. I bet earlier in the morning the donuts are fresher, but I'm not a morning person especially on vacation when I'm 3 hours ahead. The cool thing about this donut shop is they have original flavors that you're not going to find anywhere else. That might be enough motivation to wake one early morning and try their donuts again!"
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2020-03-02,5.0,"On our 4th day in Manhattan, we wanted to have a light breakfast to stroll through Central Park. Sadly, our map app did not get us here but it is super easy to locate which we did...accidentally after we gave up looking lol. It's on 7th Ave just north of the 57th subway station. They have varied doughnuts as well as coffee options. We got the a black Gold and Lemon doughnuts. Delicious. We made sure to come back to get it again before we got on our flight to leave NYC. Also, the drinks were good! A Cortado the first day and a cappuccino the second one.  They have simple syrup to mix in. Pe"
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2020-03-08,3.0,"A nice little treat. $4 for a lemon doughnut, that was good, but didn't knock my socks off by far. It's very small inside so plan to take it to-go, which is fine unless you get one of the stickier options."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-07-24,5.0,"When you eat a donut from here, aka a ""real donut"", you'll never want to have a half assed donut again.

A real donut looks like a real donut.  Freshly baked, puffy, light, airy.  And this place has flavors so unusual you don't think they will be good, but you'll be surprised.  I got the rose one, and that was heaven.  

They make a mean coffee here too.

The cost is a bit high, but if it keeps you from eating donuts all the time, then it's totally worth it."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-01-18,4.0,"It's real good. It's a yeast donut, with good height. loveee that the center has some chew. 

It reminded me of dough donuts - high quality product, with interesting and tasty flavors. I actually like that the donuts here are a little bit smaller than the dough donut. 

We tried four flavors. And it's so funny how they put it into a square box like a pizza. 

The Everything donut, is EVERYTHING 
Absolutely fav 

The classes had the best texture. Maybe because the frosting is thin

The chocolate gold was just ok 

The chandonut is so beautiful!!! Great for a girls party/brunch. They are a gorgeous pastel pink color. And the taste was sweet, and boozy. Texture was good"
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-01-08,5.0,"One of the best doughnuts spots in NYC! The doughnuts are always fresh. They have unique flavors that sometimes sound like they might be  not be good, but the ingredients end up working well together and tasting amazing! This was my first visit to this location and it is similar to the location on Morton street. The employees were very nice and friendly.

We had the birthday cake doughnut, the old fashioned, and the whiskey espresso.

Birthday cake doughnut = small but filled with flavor. Fresh and fluffy. The filling tastes like cake frosting with sprinkles. If you love birthday cake flavored desserts, then get this. 

Old fashioned = my least favorite doughnut that I have tried from The Doughnut Project. It was bland and flavorless. There are more exciting options to get so I would pass on this next time.

Whiskey espresso = interesting flavor combo, but they complimented each other. It wasn't overly espresso flavored, but also wasn't overly whiskey flavored. Both flavors could be tasted. It was fluffy and fresh. 

If you haven't eaten a doughnut from The Doughnut Project, you are missing out!"
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-06-26,4.0,I think I tried all the local doughnut shops by now. I stumbled upon this joint on my way to the train and decided to try the beet with ricotta. Wow. This was a very interesting creation. It is not like your boston cream or similar but rather savory. The beet taste is not bitter but it creates a savory doughnut rather than sweet doughnut. The ricotta filling complements the beet flavor perfectly. Imagine eating beets and cheese for dinner but now sandwiched and in a dessert form. This was a great way to eat up my daily caloric intake.
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2020-02-10,4.0,Got a sweet tooth after a meal or why not a bunch of donuts for a meal?  This place has so many different kinds of donuts that it will be frustrating to pick one or five.  Will return to try other donuts here! Very tasty. The only thing is the unattentive staff.. they were more focused on their own conversations then serving customers.
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2020-01-18,5.0,Amazing unique flavored doughnuts. I had the chocolate salted caramel. It was amazing. They are a small location so you'll miss it if you blink. They also run out of doughnuts so go early to ensure the best selection. The staff was really nice and helpful.
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-05-23,5.0,"THANK you yelpers for helping me to find this place. I think I searched for ""BEST doughnut"" and found Doughnut Project!  the flavors are WOW.

my only thing is I like cake doughnuts, so would love to see these toppings on cake doughnuts...

these were like ""standard glazed"" doughnuts with AMAZING toppings. 
would've like better, amazing toppings without the glazed ""undercoat""

Please open one in Silicon valley? May I suggest Mountain View or Los Altos, CA? I'll bring my foodie posse."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2020-01-15,5.0,"I don't know where to start but I have brought donuts from both locations and I have never been disappointed!!! I order from postmates or caviar but caviar is wayyy faster. 

On to the donuts, I cannot express it in words how delicious these donuts are. Super fresh, super yummy and big enough to make your heart and soul happy! 

From the weekend exclusives, birthday cake cinnamon roll to the coquito to the Manhattan cream. Each and every flavor is unique. I'd like biting into a mystery land of flavors. Tastebuds will be very happy! 

When I go in person, the ladies are super nice and they make the best iced coffees. Super attentive and they are welcoming. 

Move over doughnut plant, we got a new award winning donuts in town!"
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2018-11-09,4.0,"Stumbled across this location walking out of Central Park and had to try it. It has long been on my list of must-try dessert spots. It was mid-afternoon on a weekday and the store was fairly quiet, they had run out of a few flavors, but my 1st choice was available. 

I got the Black Gold Texas Tea($3.75) doughnut and it was well worth the price tag. The doughnut was dense and chewy with rich authentic chocolate coating, the crumble on top was on point. Will return again to try the famed birthday cake flavor."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-07-28,5.0,"A great place to get a quality doughnut. My favorites are the Maple Bacon and PB&J. The Maple Bacon has a sweet and savory flavor to it. The glaze is a maple glaze topped with a crispy bacon on top of it. The dough itself is perfectly fried, soft, and chewy. Do not fear away from this doughnut as it is worth every bite, it also is one of the first to sell out. Try to get it before noon. The PB&J is the perfect doughnut for peanut butter lovers. It reminds me of being a kid at home and having my mom make me a pb&j sandwich. Can't go wrong with either."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-12-27,2.0,"As a disclaimer, I live in California. Tried this as it was hipster with lots of new funky types. Ordered old fashioned chocolate plus a holiday special called ""decade"" with gold coins on it. Both were so sweet couldn't finish half of one and had to throw it away. Tried with coffee, still couldn't take it.The chocolate one had no chocolate and had some mint flavor. Overall a disappointment."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-04-15,5.0,"So good.  We had the lemon poppy seed , champagne glaze and original old fashion . They have unique flavors too. They also serve coffee . Very close to Central Park! Stop by this place!"
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-03-16,1.0,"Had a truly disappointing experience here! Came for their Matcha doughnut collab with T2Tea and was expecting something amazing after the photos I saw on their Instagram... I left with something that looked like half of their Instagram...

Look at the pics and see for yourself! I wish I had gotten more pictures of the filling, but there was truly nothing filled about the donut... 

It was missing the matcha whipped cream and was so tiny for $4.75!! Tinier than the small square piece of napkin it was on... I actually wouldn't have minded the price I paid if 1. It was actually filled like it was supposed to be and 2. It actually had all the components it said it would have ‍ 

1/10 would not recommend unless you go there and get a normal doughnut because then you won't have been deceived by a lack of filling and lack of actual ingredients!"
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-07-24,4.0,"Love the flavor selection here! All the combinations sounded so good I couldn't get just one. Also, luckily we paid a visit during fronut season! We ended up getting the Blueberry and yuzu, Lemon love letter, and the Banana split fronut. The dough was soft and I liked the slight tartness of the blueberry and lemon donuts because it didn't taste too sweet.  

Surprisingly, I didn't love the fronut. The flavors were good, but it was really hard to bite into at the beginning because of the frozen banana cream inside. I liked it closer to the end when the banana cream was starting to melt a little bit. One regret was not getting the Everything donut! I heard good things about it, so hopefully I remember to get it next time along with some more flavors."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-01-21,4.0,"The hubby stumbled upon The Doughnut Project while trolling the upper west side. He came in late in the day so the pickings were a little slim. He got:

- Old fashioned glazed - delicious - not too fried and not too much glaze

- Chandonut - hubby loved, but no one else did. Too much rosewater.

- Tullamore Dewnut - whiskey​ and espresso totally delicious

- Chocolate - very good but nothing too crazy

Looking at their website I can see several other doughnuts I want to try...Can't wait!!"
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2020-03-07,3.0,"Doughnuts just look good in pictures but it was like a thicker Dunkin donuts but more lemony in flavor. Had the everything doughnut, a maple bacon and plain fritter. Very large servings and like most reviews... Too sweet... And I'm a doughnut lover."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-02-24,3.0,"This location doesn't get as many specialty donuts as the main location (they post a ton of stuff on their Instagram that did not show up any of the three times I visited this location). The donuts are delicious, the service is friendly, and the coffee is good. 

At the price point and genre, I think they could do a little better. I am an absolute fiend for donuts - basic AF to otherworldly, I try them all. Doughnut Project makes their doughnuts too large. The inside has a lovely fluffy texture that isn't too sweet, but the outside does not get a good crisp to it. It's hard to get a solid bite with all the components together. 

They have some great donuts (I loved the Chandonut and Miso Caramel in particular) but others fall flat (the beet ricotta and pbj do not have a lot going for them). They need some tweaks to move up in the gourmet donut game."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2020-01-20,4.0,"Had the Bronx, Manhattan Creme, and Glazed...all were good, light and fluffy. I could have done with a little less icing on the Bronx but good flavors. Would like to try the everything next time."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2020-02-18,5.0,"Came here on a Tuesday morning to get a coffee and doughnut. Had never tried their doughnuts, so I asked the staff to help me pick one. He was so sweet and walked me through their flavors and recommended a few. The coffee was great and the doughnut was AMAZING. Light and soft texture and the icing was perfectly sweet (not too sweet). Definitely a hidden gem and it's a must try."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2019-01-05,3.0,"Having enjoyed the fried Dough, though less-so service, at Troy Neal and Leslie Polizzotto's The Doughnut Project in 2017 it was with tempered expectations that a new location at 912 7th Avenue was visited Sunday, the smaller floorplan thankfully doing nothing to diminish selection while staff was efficient and pleasant.

Known to generate lines on Morton Street in the West Village since 2015 Doughnut Project number two continues to focus on producing unique toppings for a collection of leavened Brioche, popular choices like ""Everything"" and Lemon Love Letter always available while several daily specials are also rotated frequently.

Tightly packed and close to Central Park, arrival at 9:00am finding a small line, it was in four items that $15.50 was invested and taking the box outdoors to indulge it was with fingers quickly sticky that White Chocolate with Pink Peppercorn Glaze came first, the base springy and exceptional while just a touch of heat was detected amidst sweetened Cocoa Butter.

Described as ""Mad Scientists,"" though the ""New Old Fashioned Doughnut"" looks and tastes awfully similar to that at Blue Star out West, it was returning to raised rings that Whiskey and Espresso came strong, the bitterness barely kept in check by Sugar while a best-seller called The Bronx comes out of left-field but performs remarkably well by using Olive Oil to form Icing that is then kicked up with Black Pepper."
986,the-doughnut-project-new-york-5,2018-12-31,4.0,"As a cookie aficionado, I don't always have that much stomach real estate to devote to doughnuts - they're always a little too bread-y for me and I always feel pressured to eat the whole thing in one go (which reflects more on me than doughnuts, actually). But would I ever turn down a doughnut, especially one from the Doughnut Project? Of course not. 

The inside is pretty adorable but cramped. If it's nice out, I would take a doughnut or two to Central Park. Or doughnut-covered socks if you're so inclined. 

- Maple bacon bar. This thing was almost as big as my head. The actual dough was soft and chewy, and the maple glaze was not overly sweet. My one complaint is I wish they chopped the bacon strips into smaller pieces so the whole thing doesn't slide off and you're stuck awkwardly trying to snap apart bacon filaments with your fingers. 

- Everything doughnut. I had the most reservations about this one. I am genuinely not a fan when places try to mash together sweet and savory into combinations that definitely work better as separate things. This was something that sounded intriguing in theory but the cream cheese glaze and natural sweetness of the dough wasn't enough to counterbalance the poppy seeds, sunflower seeds, and salt. My mind was utterly thrown off. I didn't know what exactly I was eating. Definitely a gimmick to try once - you may end up liking it. 

- Stuffed PB&J. 10/10. I tell you, the fruity glaze on top was a dead ringer for the Smucker's that my mom would knife out of the jar for my childhood sandwiches. This took me right back to 6th grade after school snacks. 

- Black Gold, Texas Tea. Also 10/10. There's no way that brownie batter and chocolate crumble are NOT going to taste good together. One thing, though: be sure to check your teeth after eating this. 

- I lucked out and got the last apple fritter. It was a little cold and juuust on the edge of turning stale so I doctored it up with a turn in the toaster oven and some Greek yogurt and honey. Beautiful but you won't need to eat another meal anytime soon. 

All of the doughnuts, on the whole, were on the greasier side, though that explains why they all stayed pretty moist."

I had a surprisingly good iced chai tea latte, and the lemon meringue tarts are incredible (you can get mini or regular size). I'll definitely be back for more of the pastries.

Update: the tiny chocolate tarts are amazing as well!"
987,masseria-caffé-and-bakery-new-york-3,2019-05-18,5.0,"Finally got a legit cappuccino in Times Square area. And the croissant was delicious. They also had the uvetta pastry which is a raisin snail but I guess a lot of people aren't liking raisins these days so they are hard to find.

Run by Italians from Italy... Ordered from here a little while ago this morning... I enjoy their frittata rustica especially and the foccacia barese. The only negative is that this place is TINY and I really don't like taking my cortado or macchiato to go, but you feel squeezed in here.  Service is brisk though which helps.

It was quality coffee, shout-out to Lavazza/Eataly/Italy for contributing these lovely beans to the world. There's three seats in the entire place so prepare to wait for a seat and be in as tight a space as possible, or take your coffee to go. 

They also have pastries, fritters, yogurts, and more, especially in the small fridge section. Makes for a quick and cheap breakfast, but of course, certain items' prices are raised by a hair than they normally would be, like Chobani. Regardless, if you're looking for quality coffee that's not Starbucks or Gregory's in midtown, and seating nor ambiance nor a bathroom is important to you, this is your spot."

987,masseria-caffé-and-bakery-new-york-3,2017-07-08,4.0,"I ordered the ricotta cheese cake, raspberry tart, lemon meringue tart, and the cannolini (I think?)

Ricotta cheese cake - rich dairy cream flavor, do not mistake this for a NY style cheese cake. It's less dense, no tartness, and very tasty. The crust is nothing special. I'd get this again.

Raspberry tart - this is a jam-style tart, the filling is basically pure raspberry preserves with seeds. The texture was a little too much like eating preserves out of a jar for my tastes, it's pretty dense. Also a bit too sweet. Very concentrated raspberry flavor though

Lemon meringue - classic, textbook lemon meringue. Good balance of tartness and sweetness in the lemon curd, the meringue was very stable and didn't weep overnight. Perfect.

Cannolini - the outside is a very airy dough of sorts, similar to a croissant but it's crisp and breaks into chunks rather than shattering. The filling has a strong hit of lemon which is good but the ricotta doesn't shine like in the classic cannoli (shoutout to Boston's north end). They are filled to order though which I appreciate.

The guys at the counter were nice and the prices were fair. I think the cheese cake was 4.50, tarts maybe 3.50? and the cannolini was $2"

1.  The staff is amazing and very friendly and have a great sense of humor. 
2. The freaking lemon meringue pie is what dreams are made of!!! Hats off for the pastry chef. Let me tell you the meringue is pillowy soft and velvety smooth. The lemon curd has just the right amount of tartness and most importantly not too sweet. The crust, oh my goodness the crust is flakey, delicate and buttery. Each bite melted Into a. absolute song in my mouth.  I was so sad to have my last bite.  Now I'm just dreaming about it in the Bay Area

The apricot tart had a great crust and a beautiful color. However, the filling was very thick and sweet. I could not continue eating it. It either needs to be half the thickness or mixed with something to cut the sweetness. 

Chris has the blueberry muffin which while nothing special was a solid breakfast snack."

If you are in NY or by time square you have to visit this little cafe. 
Easy to find."
987,masseria-caffé-and-bakery-new-york-3,2016-07-28,4.0,"It's operated by real Italians: they use lavazza coffee. So it can't be bad! There are also all kinds of bakeries. I got bomboni, which is fried dough. Kinda like donought, too sweet for me, but it's fluffy and nice. I'll probably wanna try homemade other savory items next. It's probably new, so not so many reviews here."

I'm glad I followed the recommendations for this place. Really great Italian cappuccino. The frittata was perfect for a quick breakfast. Highly recommended."
987,masseria-caffé-and-bakery-new-york-3,2017-10-05,5.0,Went here with a friend and discovered the delicious masala chai its was good but the lemon tarts were better you can taste the freshness in every bite. It was just delicious can't wait to stop in again.
987,masseria-caffé-and-bakery-new-york-3,2016-04-24,5.0,"Thus tiny little place has so much charm! I stayed in the building right next to it (maybe even the same building) while visiting NY for the first time. I wanted real good coffee. None of that Star%#*€ stuff. The coffee is very good! The baked goods are out of this world! They also serve sandwiches and salads. It all looked so good! Very friendly service and the prices are very reasonable! If this place was around where i live in Montreal, this would be my morning stop every day. Rain or shine ;) I tried the ham and cheese with tomato sauce panzerotto. Warm, soft, filled with stuff...Oh my... Where was this panzerotto all my life!!! Combining it with an americano, you're set to go! Anytime in Manhattan NY, this is a place to stop by and grab your first morning coffee. A must! If this place is this good, i can't imagine how great their restaurant is."
987,masseria-caffé-and-bakery-new-york-3,2018-11-23,5.0,"High quality coffee in midtown right next to the Masseria restaurant. They have one of the best lattes and cappuccinos in the area and their food and pastry options are excellent. It is a small real estate and while they have a small counter, it's not meant to be a place where you hang out. Essentially purely for takeout but really good quality if you are looking to grab coffee and snack in the area (especially not from Starbucks)"

Very convenient to where we are staying. Locals were here ordering as well, and if the locals go, you know it must be good."
987,masseria-caffé-and-bakery-new-york-3,2017-01-09,4.0,"Felt like a family owned establishment. Met some friends before their show and stopped by here after for a pick me up. Got a latte and a regular coffee. The latte was great (according to my wife) and the regular coffee was nice and strong. 

The customer service was excellent too."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2020-02-25,5.0,Great coffee place if you're tired of coffee elsewhere. The brew is strong and they make fresh batches through the day. Don't expect to find a seat to sit.
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2020-02-20,3.0,"I don't think there's anything great about zibetto, the design in the foam? Maybe.  But the coffee wasn't hot and the foam from my girlfriends mug was spilled and not even fancy.

The cofffee tasted fine but there weren't many options; even after the barista said ""we can make you anything you want, prosciutto, arugula.."" when referring to a sandwich, we said yeah that and we said no tomato or cheese and he just stared blankly and said ""oh no we can't""

So I don't see a reason to rave about the place, no
What am I missing?"
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-08-24,4.0,"I needed an coffee pronto and finally paid a visit to this spot before work.  I love the interior with the marble setting and minimalist style.  The modern style is beautiful and a great setting for authentic Italian coffee. 

The latte I ordered was some of the best coffee I had and the chocolate croissant had the perfect ratio of sweetness to help balance out the buttery taste."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-08-02,4.0,"Ambiance: sleek, fancy, professional, bright.

Seating: a few tables and a standing bar. Not so crowded, even during lunch time. 

Bathroom: has one! 

Prices: high! An espresso and an almond milk latte were almost $10. 

Coffee: very similar to Italian or Australian. Decent quality. Portions smaller than expected for the prices. I enjoyed my latte though. It's a level above Starbucks and one below La Colombe. 

Service: professional, to the point, fast. They have a guide to their menu by the cashier.  

Yelp perk: buy a salad, get a free coffee!"
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-09-11,2.0,"Honestly everytime I come here, I ask myself, Why did I.  Im not an espresso, cappacino or macchiato lover.  I am straight American coffee, so here at Zibetto's it would be an Americano.  And it tastes like I'm drinking liquified dirt. 

Not a fan."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-09-28,4.0,"So...I went here...again. I had the mini caprese sandwhich. Paninied. Uh boy...it is so good. The buttery, slightly sweet brioche with yummy tomatoes and memory fresh Italian mozzarella. I kind of couldn't get it out of my mind. Simple and delicious because the quality was great. I will return. I will eat. I will drink. I will post. I want to eat one right now, but it's only open to 4pm on Saturdays~"
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2020-01-04,5.0,If you like espresso- this is your place. Hands down the smoothest espresso I have ever had. I typically order a latte or cappucino with almond milk. Both are amazing. My mom and sister tried a hot chocolate and it was also amazing. This location is very spacious- lots of room for meetings with friends or for work. Will be back!
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-12-27,5.0,I love coffee and I can say that the iced cappuccino is delicious. It's extremely smooth while still having that strong coffee flavor. The place is super cute and the staff is friendly as well.
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-03-21,5.0,"When I first walked in here I was not impressed with the menu or the treat selections. It's a very European menu, no frills, no fancy drinks. 

But after tasting the espresso my mind was quickly changed. The flavor profile is unbelievable, the cappuccino I get has the perfect mouth feel, and just the right ratio of bitter and sweet. Generally I like a flavored coffee but Zibetto manages an espresso drink so perfect I don't was any sweetener or flavor. 
The drinks come with a weighty price tag, but honestly it's worth it. On more than one occasion I've craved a coffee from here specifically, and it's always worth the extra travel to get here.

They have a few treats to pick from as well. Some are better than others, but they're all just pretty standard. You're going here for the espresso!! 

They also have a ton of space which is awesome. It's pretty easy to snag a seat. I love that the whole place has a calm but upscale feel. 
The employees are nice and clearly know what they're doing, and do it efficiently."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-01-06,5.0,"A perfect coffee in the theater district!
Slightly pricey but definitely worth it

A comfortable spot on a Sunday afternoon , away from the hustle and bustle of time square

A must to return!"
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-07-04,4.0,"Attractive little spot in the heart of Midtown, located at 48th St. and 6th Ave. (direct entrance is on 48th St.)

Not a cheap coffee shop by any means - and they didn't have a ton of food items to nosh on when I stopped in - but the cappuccino was good and the environment was generally nice. 

Stopped by after work hours and the line was not terribly long but seating was sparse. Was able to grab a seat but had to clean off the table a little myself since the (lazy) person who sat there before me thought it was too much work to stand up and take 2 steps to discard their garbage into the receptacle."

Had a iced latte, it was OK, nothing special. Not sure if i want to pay $5 for an OK coffee again...."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-10-24,5.0,"Zibetto is a white marble top masterpiece I'd a coffee shop.  Everyone who works there is Italian, they are super nice.  I love their sandwiches and espresso.  This place knows italian coffee like Caesar knew the Rubicon."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-12-30,4.0,"I love this place.  There are plenty of serious coffee and espresso shops in the area, but Zibetto is a bit different as it reminds me of an Espresso shop you would find in Italy.  Rather than the subdued vibe of most coffee shops, Zibetto is all white with a long white marble bar, high ceilings, dance music playing, a small case with treats and chocolates, and other stuff, too. Also, unlike a lot of coffee shops, there are ample places to sit at Zibetto.  
So, how is the espresso?  The espresso is very good, not the best in the world, but is very solid.  

For me, it is all about the experience.  Zibetto feels like you are taking a real break from work and escaping to somewhere else for a little while."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-06-03,5.0,"From espressos, pastries, sandwiches, to the entire staff - This is my go-to Midtown Coffee spot for a lot of these very reasons. It's tucked away in a Midtown Office, so you might miss it. 

Typical crowd is the office worker with the occasional lost tourist looking for a rest room break. 

Fancy an espresso, a Nutella filled cookie or an Affogato - you cannot go wrong."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-07-19,4.0,"Such a lovely European feeling café. The coffee is excellent, made to perfection and the little treats or sandwiches you can get are scrumptious! I love that they ask you if your coffee is for here or to go. When you actually stay, they give you REAL mugs and cups and utensils. 

Starbs (Starbucks), does not do that! The staff is all dressed well and look like they care about making your coffee correctly and quickly. I am always upset that America does not have a better café culture like this store or others similar, but this is a great shop for the afternoon fix that is sometimes needed!"
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-03-08,5.0,"Great coffee. Great alternative to SBUX. Nice atmosphere. Modern and comfortable. Coffee expensive but great place to grab a coffee with a client or friend. Is this place a chain? Doesn't have that feel. When you order your coffee (no basic drip here), hey get you your coffee in under one minute. That's espresso the way it should be."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-08-25,3.0,"Had a very meh espresso here yesterday-- overly bitter. Got the job done, I suppose, and it was in a cute take-out cup.

The space is sleek and the employees are polite, but seem overwhelmed. And this was at 3 pm, not exactly the morning rush...

Prices are average for the area. Espresso shots are $3, most coffees are $5 and up. The tiny cookies by the register are $1.

I was excited because this looked authentically Italian, but don't think I'll be adding it to my rotation."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-04-05,4.0,"Very fancy and famous coffee shop. I got a hot chocolate and a biscotti. 
The hot chocolate was very bland to be honest but the biscotti helped. 

I felt a bit out of place. It wasn't too crowded but it was only business people. I was really tired and just wanted to sit and drink without feeling like a tourist. 
None of the service staff was rude or anything, I think it's just the ambiance this place is going for. 

I think it's great for a meeting with friends/colleagues, a to go coffee if you're in a rush. But it wasn't really for me. 

I am glad I got to go though!"
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-07-17,5.0,Beautiful atmosphere with phenomenal staff and a remarkably friendly staff. The owner is very nice as well. Everyone is so knowledgeable about the coffee and it's all reallllly good (and strong). A+++ HIGHLY recommended.

It looks very fancy from the outside with light, bright, decor and huge stone countertops. I will say the menu display was a little disappointing compared to their fancy decor (think diner display where the letters are individually placed)

Service was kind of slow, but it was nice to see all the fresh espresso being brewed and the coffee beans being ground right in front of you. I opted for an espresso to go-- they had the cutest little espresso cups to give it to you in."

988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-01-09,5.0,"Absolutely delicious experience here recently for coffee and Italian pastry. The icing on the cake (pun intended) is that the employees here speak Italian, which I found ever so charmingggg.

Pete and I were attending a show nearby. We were planning on eating after but Pete ""needed"" a snack. Needed.... We found this café (thanks Yelp!) and OMG we were so grateful we did. We shared one latte and one  sfogliatelle which came to ~$6. The latte was not hot enough for my liking but the perfect temperature for Pete. The gentleman at the counter tried to describe the sfogliatelle to us but look at us... you don't need to try hard to sell us a pastry. We'll take a dozen, Signore. 

There was seating and a counter but we took it to go. We will be back when we're in Midtown or to another location, should we happen upon one."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-03-10,2.0,"First of all, this is my favorite coffee in nyc. 
I would usually travel to midtown from the east village just to enjoy it. 
But this new branch is suffering from a very poor attitude and customer service, the employees were not hospitable and apparently even if you are standing in line for coffee, it doesn't seem like you should be rewarded the code to the bathroom. 
Gave it two starts only because the coffee and pastries were excellent, but the staff should be replaced. Will not be going back there even when I have business conferences in the building."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-02-13,5.0,"Went to the 6th Ave location the other day and loved it so tried this place.  Cappuccino was great.  Store has places to sit and also the standing bar.  Service is fast...not unfriendly but business like and to the point.  These guys do coffee and focus on a great cup and quick service.  If you want cozy, and comfy and dark wood and carpet go someplace else.  If you want a GREAT espresso based drink this is THE place.  Clean bright and focused on the product.  Bought a bag of their beans to try at home.  Will be back!"
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-07-18,5.0,Hands down the best coffee the Italian way. Great spot for business meetings or just chill in the City.
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-06-29,5.0,Very good espresso and latte!  I am picky about espresso shots as myself has been using professional grinders and espresso machines with fresh beans between one and three weeks to make espresso at home.   The barista there knows how to make very good espresso shots.  I tried latte as well and it did not disappoint!   I will definitely go back again.  Wish they open more locations so people will understand the difference between real espresso and the ones from Starbucks.
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2016-10-17,4.0,"Sleek and fancy, lots of room. A quiet escape from the chaos near Times Square & Seventh. Could easily work here. The espresso is good and the service friendly. 

Ordered a panini which was great. A little pricey but fair."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-02-21,3.0,"After a pretty spotty start, I think they are getting on track: the coffee has gotten much better and staff friendlier. As soon as all order takers learn to remember and correctly repeat orders as well as charge right prices, this place will be perfect. 

Update: I was wrong... Unfortunately instead of getting better, they have gotten worse. The service declined - I had my order  messed up several times. One time I did not pay attention and had to come back to exchange the regular milk latte I was served, for the soy milk one. The owner apologized profusely for almost giving me a severe lactose reaction and compensated me with a cookie - a fifty-cent (!) cookie - I was so impressed! The food is less than ok for the price (which has gone up since the new year) - the sandwich has two tissue thin slices of something, wilted green leaf/see through tomato slice and a ton of bread - not a good buy for $10. I just stopped going, at least for now."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-06-14,5.0,"The very best espresso in NYC. Italian, of course. Sandwiches on baguette, sweets. Rockefeller Center location has seating and more food choices. The other locations are traditional coffee bars straight out of Italy."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2016-10-08,5.0,"A beautiful escape in the noisy midtown area - this place knows coffee and has the nicest staff to be found around! There's not much clutter and the options are limited...but when it comes to a few good sandwiches, salads and pastries, what else do you need? 

If you are looking for something out of the ordinary and don't want to break the bank, this place has found the sweet spot. It's about as European as you can get in Manhattan when it comes to coffee."

Understood that cappuccino was supposed to be half foam half espresso, however my cup was definitely half-filled, even counting the foam! So disappointed!

Apparently you have got better options in this neighborhood - there is another Zibetto about 7 blocks away, smaller in space but definitely better in quality, I mean quantity."
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-03-14,3.0,Nice coffee bar with premium coffee. Staff are nice and the place is well maintained. two stars less because of the exceptionally high costs for everything and for the small portions.
988,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-06-17,5.0,"I have been to both locations and I think the coffee is out of this world.

You need it in your life I promise. I also picked up a baguette on a whim because who can resist a BEAUTIFUL baguette next to a best baguette of 2019 sign. Not me.. and yes I ate it on my way to the next food place haha.  

They have a bunch of seating in the back and a wide variety of food. If you love carbs (and who doesn't) you will be happy here.

It was pretty good as well and shows that not only the baked goods are good but also anything that comes out of here. Fyi, if you are on a diet don't come here! It is perfect for a cheat day. 

The worst part of Bread Bakery is that sometimes a line forms but it moves quick. Really like it here and you should definitely come check it out!"
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-11-09,4.0,"This is my go-to Manhattan bakery now that The City Bakery is kaput.  The chocolate rugulach  is the best that I have ever tasted due to its moistness inside and out, and the chocolate tastes rich.

The only thing holding me back from giving the bakery five stars is because it does not sell slices of many goods.  It mostly sells whole goods.  For example, I would like to buy the coconut chocolate chip cake and the apple strudel, but there were no slices for say, only the whole product.  I don't want to purchase anything if I don't know what it tastes like.   May I suggest selling slices of cakes or even putting out samples?"

*flourless brownie (party size) 
*cheese straws (savory)
*walnut raisin bread
*sesame roll

Ambience: The store is bright, clean, and the staff is super duper friendly.

Caveat: Many a cappuccino was watery or thin. Espresso drinks are not their strongest quality. 

Wifi: this delightful bakery doesn't have the most reliable wifi, so leave serious work at the office. 

Tip: bread loaves are $4 after 7pm (except challah) 
Tip: buy babka for a party and you will win the party"

Everything. Is. Good. 

Literally never had anything bad from here. The chocolate babka is a sick JOKE because it's one of the most delicious things I've ever had. The people are nice, good service, everything is fresh. 

GET THE BABKA. If you ""don't like chocolate"" or you've ""never heard of babka"" or you're ""eliminating sugar in 2020"" IDGAF. Live your life and stop being such a vanilla human.

989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-10-22,4.0,"We didn't explore a wide selection of baked goods and drinks at Breads, but what we consumed was very good, I was generally surprised. Headed to Central Park after a jet lagged night's sleep, Breads appeared to be the best option for a local cuppa pick-us-up; while NYC offers pretty much every food & drink option on the planet, Seattlebucks has taken over so much of the coffee real estate, it's often hard to find a local latte. 

This is where we got our much needed buzz and we scored four pastries, including a couple croissants, babka and a bagel. Two thumbs up."
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-03-30,4.0,"I like bread. I like bakeries. So with a name like Breads Bakery, can you really go wrong? My friend's really passionate about the chocolate babka here, and the bakery was featured in an Eater article, so I decided to stop by. 

Here's what I got:
- Chocolate Babka ($14.95) 
Wish they sold individual slices since they only sell whole loaves (a bit pricey). On the flip side, it's a decently sized loaf that will last and makes for a nice dessert to bring to a friend's. The key is definitely WARM IT UP before eating. When it's warm and the chocolate is oozy and goeey and the buttery layers sort of melt together-- ugh, it's hard to beat that. It's very rich; after one slice, I was content. I wouldn't mind a less sweet babka or one with darker chocolate. 

- Chocolate Rugelache ($2)
Small & can be finished in a few bites. Almost like a mini croissant but texture-wise, it was different. Keep in mind I'm no expert since this was my first-ever rugelache. There aren't flaky layers you distinguish in each bite. Instead, it's a bit more dense with a chew to it. The chocolate filling was delicious, but again, I'd prefer it less sweet or with darker chocolate. My friend said he'd like this with a tart fruit jam filling, and I agree.

I also got an iced black coffee, which is always my go-to pairing for sweets; it was solid. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try anything else, but if there was a Breads in California (*wink wink*),  I'd love to return and try the rest of their pastries/breads -- especially the the cinnamon raisin babka, quiche, and the cheese sticks!"
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2020-02-20,1.0,I usually have a good experience with breads bakery but they sold me burnt bread today :( I also ordered an iced oat latte that costed $6.5!!! Ridiculous
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-03-16,3.0,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE their breads and pastries. I only gave this location 3 stars because I felt their staff don't have a good understanding of their own product.

I got a muesli here a few days ago. Before buying, I had no idea what it is. I saw there are grains and poppyseeds on it, so I asked the guy working there if it's sweet or savory. He told me it's savory. But later I realized that it's actually sweet, because there are dried fruits in it (cranberries) and not even close to being savory.

The muesli still tastes good and healthy, but I was very disappointed at their lack of knowledge about their own breads and passing wrong information to customers."
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-06-25,5.0,"Recently stopped in here with my mom for a pre-ballet pastry/snack break after a few hours of walking. When approaching Breads we looked at eachother, smiled, and knew we were going in. I'm serious we probably looked around for 15 minutes before deciding what we wanted because everything looked and smelled soooooo delicious. The smells in this bakery are sick. We were lucky and got a lovely little seat outside and got to eat out there. We ordered a smoked cheddar croissant and a cheese danish. Of course we had the savory first and it was really really delicious, but upon biting the cheese danish we fell in love. Topped off with 2 drip coffees. Perfect day spot"
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2020-06-01,1.0,"Worst bakery store ever, staff are racist and only serve for white. Being there twice once get yelling by the staff ""keep the mask on"", because she can't hear what I said so I took my mask off for she can better hear me just for a minute. How those staffs treat white? Take a bow and treat them like God. I really don't understand because you work in the midtown bakery store so you are privileged?"
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2020-05-23,5.0,"This bakery is always amazing! My favorites are the Festive Challah (always a crowd pleaser!) and of course, the chocolate babka! The chocolate babka is so delicious. I've bought many of their breads over the years and have never been disappointed."

The price went up a little. I think it's now $15 per babka, $25 for two (instead of $14 and $22). 
Other baked goods are also good (croissant, almond croissant, etc) but their chocolate babka is by far my favorite, and you'll know the reason when you try it!
They freshly bake it multiple times a day, and I am able to get warm babka regardless of the time of the day I go in. Love breads bakery =]"

Good pastries and good coffee 
Friendly staff. Outside seating"
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-04-23,5.0,"Far and wide, I've heard tale that Breads has the absolute best babka in all of New York. Andddd.... I still haven't tried it. 

But! I have tried a bunch of their other specialties now and can definitely call myself a fan. 

Not only that, but I really like this outpost, because the store is so spacious, they have outdoor seating, and the staff is awesome!

I came with a group and we tried the cheese straws, the rugelach, an olive straw, and a chocolate chip cookie. 

We even got to try their banana bread and flourless chocolate cake which is kosher for passover (yay!) AND after watching me agonize over the decision of which pastry to choose, a really lovely employee snuck over a cinnamon bun for us to have. Way to ruin my diet and win a customer for life!

My only complaint is that it's a bit expensive, but for such good stuff, it's worth it."
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-04-07,5.0,"I've been hearing great reviews about Breads Bakery but today I experienced it for myself when we walked into their store on Broadway near Lincoln Center. Their chocolate Babkas looked fantastic and were selling as quickly as the staff were restocking their shelves. We went in to look for something "" healthy"" and ended up splitting a delicious tuna salad with a sliced hard boiled egg on a roll. We also splurged on something I never saw before: a ruggalach sandwich! It has to be one of the most decadent and delightfully yummy desserts I've ever tasted.  This is truly a bakery that's deserving of the highest praise and stars ! Thankfully they have a few locations in NYC!"
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-02-03,4.0,"I have a story involving the famed chocolate babka: I brought it to a housewarming party the first year I moved back to New York. As a down-to-the-core homebody, at one point during the evening, I sat by myself in a corner and ate all of the gooey, amazing innards of a babka loaf, wiped the crumbs off my lap, and left without doing a sad lap of the goodbye circuit. It was a very fulfilling night. Breads and the babka is one of the reasons why I love this city so dearly. 

Anyway, I've already sung my praises for the downtown location - this outpost has the same selection of goods but a much more disorganized seating area. Whereas the Union Square shop has the bakery right when you walked in and a cafe area further back, this spot mashes both spaces together. I popped in once during the November-December holiday craze and it was absolute pandemonium: about three or four haphazard lines with people cutting in and out, cashiers randomly shouting, dirty tables, etc. 

On to the food: grab the pastries and bread (including sandwiches that come on said bread). They also have small tins of hummus, quinoa salad, yogurt parfaits but you can get those for cheaper elsewhere. 

Special shout out to the sufganiyot (filled with chocolate and strawberry jelly) and the chocolate almond croissant that I would gladly eat every day for the rest of my life if health didn't preclude me from doing so. The brie and olive sandwich is also good for back-to-back meals, though, fair warning, your breath will be terribly offensive for everyone else. And I love the egg salad sandwich but it's pretty dense with the mayo. I'd also aspire to be that person who demolishes a whole mushroom quiche with their bare hands. 

The one downside was some kind of tuna salad with soggy leaves; overpriced for not that much ingredients besides lettuce and not satisfying at all."
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-03-31,3.0,"While I'm generally please with the baked goods at Breads bakery , their Union Square location is a lot better . Not only is this uptown location smaller ,but if you're getting to this uptown location nearing closing hours and expecting to get your goods discounted a la the union square location you will be in for some disappointment. Merely 30 mins before closing I was told by I think her name was Sofee that,"" We don't do that at this location"" . Got afew things here and they were good but not as super fresh as I normally get downtown. 

I'd probably try to stick to the union square location as their goods do tend to be fresher with higher turnover ,more familiar faces and yes occasional discounted goods around closing hours."
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-08-10,2.0,"Meh.  Overpriced pastries and bread, decent quality but not worth the price.  Rude service."
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2018-12-06,4.0,Just when I didn't think anyone can reinvent the wheel and boom I dived into this establishment for a quick croissant latte combo snack and both taste amazing.  The facility was clean and spacious.  The latte was definitely up to par with the major chains and competitors from block to block because obviously we all know there are no shortages of cafe and baristas in this urban jungle.
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2018-07-07,5.0,"The babka here is really something. Super soft and buttery, laced with fine lines of ultra-sweet chocolatey goodness. We came in as soon as Breads opened. We bought one loaf ($15) of babka to share between 3 people for breakfast. We could barely finish half! However, it stayed good for several days and kept the satisfaction going.

The interior of the shop is quite spacious and industrial. Not much seating space. From the moment it opened, there was a steady stream of people coming and leaving. My only real complaint is that the cash register was broken so we had to pay with card. Only had cash with me so it was a struggle getting my babka paid for. Oh well, the Jewish delicacy was worth it in the end!"
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2020-04-20,2.0,I purchased 2 loaves and what a disappointment. Both were underwhelming but worse one tasted like pesticides. Shameful. I recommend you buy grocery store bread if you want a better tasting bread.
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-01-03,2.0,"Disappointed as I've been wanting to try Breads Bakery for a while. 

I got the Poppy Seed Danish and it was not memorable. It was dry and just a plain danish; it didn't satisfy my craving for a good pastry. 

If I were to return, I'd get the mini chocolate croissants but at $2 a piece and each one smaller than my pinky finger, I don't think I'll be returning. 

Service was quick and friendly."

989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2018-09-09,2.0,"Noticed Breads Bakery from across the street. Usually, go to a Pret A Manger or Starbucks. So, try new place this time.

As I walked in on a Saturday around 12:30 pm there were lots of people. Searched for something to snack on like a salad or sandwich. There were more baked items in display cases as you enter and at the counter further up. Saw Babka, honey cake, croissants, etc...
Found area where they had salads and prepared meals. Went for the Salmon with cream cheese on Sourdough bread. 

The line was confusing. I got on the line. Some people got off cause they were looking around. I came up to counter. Staff said that all you getting. I said I also wanted a large Cappuccino. Staff directed me to go to other end. Saw another staff making coffee. I stood on that line. One customer said she did not know where line was. By the time, I went to place order, the staff making coffee said I have to pay first. I told her staff mate at counter said go where you are. At least, I gave her the order. Then, I went to another line to pay. 

Couple of things 
1) Once they rang up order. The computer ask if you want to add tip. You gotta be kidding. I did self servIce. No need to tip. I went on three different lines. 

2) I had to ask for bag. 

3) The cashier asked what kind of milk after I had placed the order. 

After paying for everything, got back online for the Cappuccino. The staff made coffee for someone else. I was happy I was out of this place. What an ordeal just to get two items.

Found their baked item to be tad expensive. You can get Babka elsewhere. Cappuccino can get at any other store."
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-08-13,5.0,"I can't speak for the other items they offer, but the a seasonal Espresso Granita is the real deal. Outside of Gelato shops, I can't think of another place that puts some oomph into this drink. 

They pretty much took your ordinary slushee machine and filled it with frozen espresso, sugar, and cream. I burn 5-6 bucks anytime I'm in the area and it's embarrassing from a financial perspective. However these espresso granitas are hard to resist. I felt guilty if I didn't leave a review while drinking one, sitting beneath the trees within the boundaries of Lincoln Center, and watching the ripples occurring from this light summer drizzle upon this epically large-and-serene infinity water feature.

Does Lincoln Center deserve some credit? Yes, of course they do for the scenic backdrop, as they always should, but so does this granita from Breads."

I came here at 8 pm on a Saturday night looking for a chocolate babka and soufganiout(they ran out by 1 pm according to the register).

They had about 6 chocolate babkas left(1 for $15 or 2 for $22), So i went for the latter. 

This chocolate babka was so moist,fluffy, and not overwhelming with chocolate. I definitely recommend this place because you can get a slice or take home the whole babka which stays fresh for 4-5 days! Can keep I.T in the freezer too and warm up a slice whenever needed.

A must try!!!"
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2018-08-19,5.0,"This place has the very best rugelach I've ever tasted. (I love their rugelach sandwiches filled with chocolate ganache, strawberries, and cream, too.) The croissants and chocolate babkas are also up there. Everything has always been fresh out of the oven when I've stopped by. It's my regular stop for a snack (usually a chocolate croissant) and coffee following a long run in Central Park. There are only a few spots to sit, so I usually get my stuff to go and sit on the steps in front of the Lincoln Center to enjoy them."
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2019-11-29,5.0,"Best bakery!! Love the crunchy bourekas, and the rougalach are perfection, not too sweet and filled with chocolate. Coffee is great too. Loved it!"

Not really a place to hang out indoors..there are a few tables inside and a larger number outside. It was certainly bustling. The chai latte was solid, but their breads and pastries are the real stars. I highly suggest getting a fun bread snack here (I really enjoyed the olive and rosemary breadstick). I can see myself coming back here when it gets warmer."

Next visit I'm getting a chocolate one for myself. The babkas were sticky but fortunately there is a bathroom on site so I was able to rinse my hands!
989,breads-bakery-new-york-9,2018-06-17,5.0,"Overall - Amazing chocolate rugelach!

What I got - chocolate rugelach, rugelach sandwich 

Taste - Amazing. The flavor of the chocolate rugelach is almost exactly like the chocolate babka. The difference is in the texture. The rugelach is rolled pastry similar to a croissant but not quite the same. Whereas the babka is clearly a bread with density. The rugelach is soft, flaky, and unquestionably freshly made like everything here. I like to eat it layer by layer. The chocolate is, in my opinion, the perfect amount of sweet. The rugelach sandwich is made from the chocolate rugelach but sliced in half and stuffed with nutella, strawberries, and some sort of white cream. My wife loves them!

Value - great, the prices are average but the quality is much better than average.

Service - good, counter service, staff looks happy and smiles

Atmosphere - casual, good music, relaxed

Facility - busy on a Sunday but not so much that there is a huge line. You can get in and out very fast. The facility looks new and is well maintained. ~12 people can sit inside and ~12 people outside

Need to know - there is a public restroom

Would I come back - Yes

Would I go out of my way - Yes

Additional info - this location is much smaller than their original location in union square but I haven't noticed any difference in quality between the two. It's nice to have on in uptown instead of having to go downtown all the time to get my babka on!"

Rich dark chocolate heaven!

If you're a chocolate person, Ovenly is it.

This female run and owned bakery is amazing. There are some really hard working women here and they know how to bake.

If you're coming for one thing obviously get the blackout but they also have really good cookies and make custom cakes. This location is a bit hidden and close to the water in greenpoint making it a nice little excursion. Its worth the trip and the sugar high"
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-12-24,3.0,"Came for a quick snack and a chai tea. Small place and there was already a group of ~5people taking up most if not all the regular seats. But there is seating by the wall...don't know what they style of seating is called..bar seats?

Anyway, I got Chai tea with almond milk and the muffin posted. I saw this Black out from other Yelp reviews but I was not feeling that adventurous that day. Also, it seemed to contain dark chocolate with a side of chocolate dipped in more chocolate. 
And note to you- I am not a huge chocolate fan. 

I got the ""safer"" option which looked like it would give me more bang for my buck. I got Blueberries, I got corn muffin, I got corn flakes...

This was heated up for me, well suppose to be heated up. The outer layer was warm'ish but with my first bite  the inside was cold. I did finish it but wished so hard that it was fully heated. I

Then I ordered chai tea with Almond milk.

Everything was going to plan however, I did not really like the chai tea. I like my teas to be full to medium bodied. This was very light...too light. Dare I say it was not my cup of tea."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-11-28,5.0,"Pretty much the only bakery/quick bite near my office in greenpoint.

I'm gluten free and they had the absolute best gluten free peanut butter cookie here. It's small, chewy, crunchy and salty but a cookie.

They also have an insanely dark chocolate cake with incredible frosting. The whole cake is black it looks crazy."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-08-11,5.0,"This spot is an absolute dream. The decor inside is so cozy and inviting. This small, little cafe is the perfect place to enjoy a cappuccino with a friend, pick up the best peanut butter cookies for your next girls night in, or even a lifestyle themed blogger Photoshoot. 

I am obsessed with all their amazing pastries, literally unreal. You won't find a better chai latte at Starbucks, trust me, try at Ovenly, and never look back!

I'll be back over and over again. But seriously, the cookies, UNREAL!"
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-11-19,4.0,"Love how small and cozy this space is, especially on a rainy day. It was so relaxing to be able to order a warm specialty latte and some pastries to much on while reading a few chapters of a good book. Both the coffee and pastries were warming to the soul. It was an added bonus that they have specials towards the end of the day! I think it's usually a BOGO deal. I think some of the prices might be a little high, so the specials are really worth it."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-08-31,5.0,"Ovenly forever. This location is right next to Greenpoint's WNYC Park, so when the weathers nice you can take your food to the benches or the pleasant boardwalk area. The shop has limited seating, so you wouldn't expect them to have wifi AND a bathroom for customers, but they do! :praise: 

For food, Ovenly has options for everyone: gluten free, vegan, and non-allergen. So obv there is risk for cross contamination. For instance the packaged Goldie's Granola notes that the facility is not dedicated.

Buuuut speaking of granola, theirs is awesome. The yogurt parfait is made to order, and you can add honey/agave at the coffee bar. I think it's regular milk, vanilla yogurt. 

The hot coffee is also self serve (get cup from cashier), and a small drip is 8oz not 12.

Eyes peeled for the deals: $1 off when you buy two cookies, $1 day-old treats, and a Yelp check in offer. The day-old gluten free treats probably have a higher risk for contamination because they keep them all on the same platter.

Lastly, no need for recommendations on individual baked items. Everything is delicious and you can't go wrong. Ovenly forever."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-01-02,5.0,"Never disappoints. Warm and cozy bakery with fresh sweet/savory bakery items and piping hot drinks. Eclectic combinations but not weirdly so. Coconut chocolate chip muffin was very subtle with no flakes of coconut - just a hint. Latte always pleases too.

And who doesn't like a silver cup for water?"

Enjoy with a cup of tea to tone down the sweetness!"
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2018-04-30,4.0,"Seriously! The vegan chocolate chip cookie here is so bomb! It didn't taste like it was vegan or cardboard like other vegan or gluten free cookies that I've had. You could barely tell that this one was dairy free! That's honestly the way it should be! 

I picked up 4 cookies, which I shared with other people. Some of who are not vegan. I didn't tell them it was vegan, and they thought it was delicious!  

I also ordered their chai lavender tea, but iced.  It was a little on the sweet side. It reminded me of that Indian dessert, gulab jamun (that doughy, soggy sweet ball).  That's what the drink reminded me of.  

I am so glad I do not live nearby because I would be here quite often.  It's a cute little spot, and I like that they have options for everyone and their different taste buds.  

It is a bit on the pricey side, but then again, vegan food is usually priced higher everywhere (which I still don't understand).  But it is, what it is..."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-08-11,5.0,OMG I have found heaven on earth and it exists in the honey cardamom latte and pistachio cookies at Ovenly. $11 for two cookies and a latte. Worth every friggin penny !!!

990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-07-23,5.0,"Seasonal quiche: eggs, asparagus, goat cheese & lemon zest
- this was amazing, the filling was not overly creamy and dense; the crust was perfectly buttery and crispy. 

Peanut butter cookie: a very chewy and cakey cookie, better than my expectations. I personally enjoy desserts that's not too overly sweet although this was sweeter than I normally would prefer. 

Honey Cardamom Latte ( w/almond milk): a hint of cardamom & sweetened with only honey. I would recommend requesting half the amount of honey if you are like me and prefer a milder sweet taste. 

Service: cashier was friendly and helpful. While warming up my quiche ( ~5 mins) , she gave me updates and passed it immediately to me when it was ready. 

Shop itself: cute, simple and minimal. Didn't have too much seating ( ~3  pairs of seating inside & 6 tables total and 3 tall tables had no seats),the tables are fairly small, not a good place to do work but a cute location for a quick cup of coffee and some pastries. 

Lots of gluten free options& some vegan options. I would come back here again whenever in Brooklyn."

Tried their famous Blackout Cake, which was pricy at $7 for a fairly small slice, and ended up being not to my taste. Buttercream was too sweet and the overall cake didn't have much flavor and was too dense for me. The salted chocolate chip cookie was also fairly mediocre, bit bland and dry."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-08-11,2.0,One problem and one big problem only. The red velvet cake doesn't have cream cheese frosting which is highly disrespectful to the classic red velvet cake. It shouldn't even be called red velvet. Who thought this was okay?
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-01-02,4.0,"Oh good lord if these sweet treats aren't the best I don't want to know what is better! 

They are pricey though! Don't make the mistake of ordering the doughnut muffin thing without inquiring about the cost (it's not on the board). I felt bad because the woman took it out of the case and then told me the price and I was like, uh sorry can you put that back, and she couldn't because of policy or whatever, so she had to cut it up for samples. I still got to taste it, and it was delicious, but not worth $7 imo."

I questioned the employee because their sign advertises that all treats are 2 for 1 after 5pm, not specifically their breakfast items. I was told that 5 Pm is when breakfast items are for sale, not their other pastries. That sale begins at 6 pm. 
The employee even AGREED that their sign is unclear and that it is misleading.

DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY. They falsely advertise sales in order to get rid of old product. It a scam. There are so many other, better options out there. I will never return. Their items are good and my dad who is gluten free loved them, but I will never support a buisness who falsely advertises just to get rid of their old product. 
They should be ashamed."

1 A bit pricey
2 Olive oil pumpkin bread was too sweet. (Oh, how I wish bakeries made half-sweet versions of their desserts, like how boba places let you choose your sweetness level.)
The seating is a bit cramped, and no real way to keep out draft in cold weather. In nice weather, take it to go and eat in the waterfront park nearby."

990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-03-18,3.0,"Love the place and the snacks they offer, but I've recently noticed a troubling trend around closing time. Instead of closing at the stated hours, the door is locked as much as 20 minutes in advance. This seems like a small deal, but with longer days in store, I would like to salute the sunset with the help of a friendly neighborhood cookie.  Please keep your store open until the actual closing time. My waistline depends on it."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2016-06-27,5.0,"Overly, we finally meet. All my Yelp buds have been raving about this place, lots of 5 star reviews?! Lets take a walk on the Greenpoint wild side and see what's up.

My son & I walk into the location, there's a photographer taking pictures of two ladies eating freshly baked cookies. Dang! Put me in these pictures, I can put 3 cookies in my mouth. Hey, its a talent! ;)

What a nice looking store, all their cakes and pastries are in a glass cabinet for your selection. There is the ferrari of espresso machines all the way in the back. My son and I each order cookies plus one to split. 

I line up my picture with my iPhone and take a picture of our purchase. Then, I take a bite of the salted chocolate chip cookie. Mamma mia, what a tasty tasty cookie! 

My son looks at me and gives me a thumbs up. Totally getting some Ovenly lovely goodness Saturday morning.

If you want to try a good cuppa coffee and baked goods, look no further than Ovenly in Brooklyn NY"

The staff are so nice, and the bakery is NYC style."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2017-07-26,4.0,"'C' is for Cookie.  That's good enough for me.

Well, that may be good enough for Cookie Monster, but I guess I'm more discerning.  'Cause I can't unequivocally say I love all the Cookies I've tried from here.  But there's one I love so hard, it makes up for the rest:

Salted Vegan(!) Chocolate Chip Cookie: Unless you've decided to doom yourself to a life without butter and eggs, It's not worth the calories.  Not when NYC boasts far better specimens, like Levain's crisp-on-the-outside, ooey-gooey-on-the-inside, utra-thick behemoths.   Or the chewy, crisp-exteriored beauties from Jacques Torres, made from dough ""aged"" in the fridge for 24-36 hours, and packed with bittersweet chocolate in every bite.  Unless you've been a vegan so long you've forgotten how much flavor butter adds to a Chocolate Chip Cookie, you'll be disappointed by this.

Salted Peanut Butter Cookie:  I know this is a cult favorite because it contains tons of PB and NO FLOUR.  But I have tried it a few times now and find it too sweet and in need of more Peanutty flavor.  But maybe that's me.  

Stumptown Shorty, known nowadays as Burnt Sugar Espresso Shortbread:  Yes, a thousand times,Yes!  Mega fan of this Espresso Shortbread, punctuated with caramelly bits of ""burnt sugar.""   I even tried to make it at home once, but ended up with a crumbly, albeit delicious mess. But, yeah, while this may get less attention than the above two, I love its buttery simplicity, amped up by the bitter notes of coffee and those aforementioned ""burnt sugar"" bits.

Though not a Cookie, I feel compelled to put in a good word for the moist, aromatic, nutty Pistachio Cardamom Gluten-free (!) Quickbread, which seems to get its share of raves.  Definitely justified.  Also pretty fond of the Scones, especially Blue Cheese Walnut and Cheddar Mustard, which they used to sell at more-convenient-for-me, Whole Paycheck... err...Foods.. err...soon-to-be Amazon in Gowanus.  Please bring them back, WF.:)

While I'm not sure I'd call this place destination-worthy, it has become a tradition of sorts for hubby and I to stop in after stocking up on smoked fish at Acme, just a few blocks away."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-10-05,5.0,I would give it a 6 very nice options a little busy in a good way the people that work there are very charming the hours are good a little small next to a park and the food was very good I got  a lemon raspberry poppy seed loaf
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2017-05-01,3.0,"They have the smallest size (shot glass) of drip coffee I have ever seen, it's a pricy one too for that size. 
On the bright side, the peanut butter salted cookie and the chocolate cupcakes are to die for."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2017-07-28,4.0,"I'm impressed with their cakes. I tried the blackout and the smore's flavors, both were really good without being too heavy. 

Even though I'm normally a loyal chocolate fan, I must say that they did a good job with the Smore's flavor, very tasty and unique!"
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2015-08-14,3.0,"I've been wanting to try Ovenly for a while, so made a special trip specifically to try some of their goodies. I splurged and got 2 cookies (chocolate & peanut butter), banana bread and a banana and chocolate chip muffin. 

I wasn't a fan of the banana bread or muffin at all. They were very dense and to me didn't really taste of banana and tasted kind of grainy? 

The cookies were a lot better and definitely what I would suggest sticking too. They were quite rich and tasted of chocolate and peanut butter. I wasn't totally sold on the salt thing, but that might have contributed to there good taste. 

They offer a loyalty card, so when you buy 10 cookies you get one free. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here again, but I would pick up a cookie if in the area."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2018-03-26,5.0,"Amazingly helpful staff, excellent Stumptown coffee and a variety of sweet and savory treats. Probably the best quality pastry in Greenpoint (I've tried them all). 

It's lovely to have staff who greet you with a smile, and get to know you as a regular customer and treat you as a neighbor. I frequent the bakery in running clothes and am consistently asked about the next race I'm training for. The first day I moved to Greenpoint I locked myself out of my home without my cell phone. Just seconds away from closing time, a staff member allowed me to sit in the cafe and use the phone to contact a locksmith. Kindness goes a long way in this city."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2019-03-23,3.0,"Blackout cake: It's okay. I made a Blackout cake once for a birthday, and it was delicious. I figured I could order this, since so many people rave about it, and save myself the work. I was wrong. It's got a strong stout flavor, which was first unexpected, but not necessarily off-putting. The cake is very...thick...not fudge or pudding-like, but...thick. Maybe the consistency while chewing could be compared to eating a peanut butter sandwich with too much peanut butter on it. It also has a bitter taste, probably from the stout, dark chocolate, and less sugar in the recipe. It's really not bad, but I don't think it's a cake everyone would like."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2017-11-20,3.0,"That Brooklyn black out cake wasn't what I expected. It wasn't bad but it didn't taste the way it looked. I was expecting a rich full chocolate cate whereas I got a semi sweetened chocolate cake that was as black as my soul. The coffee I had was great though, stumptown all day. I'll have to try their other pastries and such but it wasn't bad!"
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2017-06-20,5.0,"Ovenly is one of my favorite coffee shops (bakeries?) in the city. 

Tucked away from everyone and everything in Greenpoint and just a few steps away from the water, Ovenly continues its unassuming existence on a tiny block where none of the stores and restaurants are in competition with one another to stand out. There is a harmonious peacefulness that has taken over the whole street, regardless of how short it is, which makes this cute little spot that much more pleasant to visit.

There are only 3 tables (each for two people) and a few stools along a small bar by the wall, but unlike most coffee shops in the city, there's never a crowd here (or at least none that I've come across), so finding a seat is not something you need to worry about. 

Even though they're not a certified gluten-free bakery, almost all of their baked goods are gluten-free and they are, hands down, the most delicious I've had at any coffee shop in the city. You really can't go wrong with anything, but my favorites are the pistachio-agave and peanut butter & sea salt cookies. They also make birthday cakes, which I haven't had the pleasure of trying yet, but am sure taste equally fantastic.

Oh, and - they're coffee's molto bene too!"
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2014-06-15,5.0,"Ovenly = heavenly

At first, I thought may be my GPS did me wrong again - driving around super-narrow West St and around industrial neighborhood was not what I expected. But turn on Greenpoint Avenue towards the water, and here is it, beautiful heavy iron-and-glass door with ""Ovenly"" written on it... 

The feel of the area, the closeness to the water - it is all reflects in the space and surroundings, in my opinion. In best way possible.
There is something about this place. No pretense, modern, clean, yet simply brilliant and a little nostalgic. 
Cookies, sweets, bars and cakes. Self-serve coffee.Tiny tables with cute flower arrangements.

Cookies are fantastic. Seriously, you gotta try some! I love, love love, pistachio agave. Perfect texture, perfect taste. 

You know you want some. Go!"
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2016-07-16,4.0,"Adorable little coffee shop. My boyfriend goes to Ovenly every morning before work, so when we were in Greenpoint over the weekend he insisted that we stop in. I'd already experienced the joy of their chocolate chip sea salt vegan cookies, but I really fell in love with the location. 

Ovenly is a small but really bright and beautiful space. They have a huge front window and four 2-person tables and a longer bar with seats, I'd be surprised if you could fit more than 20 people in there at once. Music was great and the vibe was surprisingly friendly (let's be real, a lot of coffee hipsters aren't the warmest people). 

The cold brew is fantastic but super strong, so beware if you're caffeine-sensitive! I also got a savory scone with goat cheese/mushrooms and it was so delicious - perfect flaky crust and good balance with the pastry filling. Will definitely be back when I move to the neighborhood."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2017-08-16,5.0,"I know a photographer who charges $500 for a session OR 2 peanut butter cookies from Ovenly. This is to say that the things you eat here have a certain kind of power. My weakness, though I am not one to turn away the cookies, is their personal mini quiche. I got there early enough one time to get one right out of the oven and it isn't an overstatement to say that I haven't felt that happy before or since. That said, I'll eat them cold, old or any way they have them.

The other day I walked in and didn't see any quiche. I said:

""Hello. What have you done with the quiches?""

""The quiche is right here."" *woman motions to a nearly finished full-sized quiche.*

""No, I mean the personal mini quiche.""

""Oh we don't have those anymore.""

I felt afraid, but I walked toward the fear, embraced change and said,

""I'll have a slice of that then please.""

It was every bit as good as the personal mini quiche. I learned a lot about myself that day, and about quiche, fear and change."
990,ovenly-brooklyn,2018-07-05,5.0,"I purchased both the pistachio buttercream honey cake and the Brooklyn blackout cake from here.

I thought both were excellent. I love that the Brooklyn blackout tasted like a rich chocolate but not exactly so overpowering. It's definitely different from your average tasty chocolate cake.

I also loved the pistachio buttercream. First, because it is gluten-free, and I can't have gluten (but I sampled the Brooklyn blackout cake anyway). Second, because it tastes like a tasty Indian dessert. It came very close to halwa or ras-malai flavors with the pistachio and cardamom. But I just never had these flavors in cake form. I personally am a cake fanatic so I would say I prefer this. As someone from an Indian family, I know they will love this cake if I ever need one for an occasion. But if you love honey, pistachio and cardamom, you will love this cake. Absolutely worth a try."

There was a lot of salmon and cream cheese, but the salmon kind of lacked the flavor I desired. It was a bit bland and seemed a bit watery."

This bagel was so big that I had to cut it in half and eat it over a period of 2 days because I was so full I couldn't finish the other half the day I got it.  There are so many bagel and cream cheese options you may feel overwhelmed.  But it's ok. Just keep going back for more bagels.

Like a layer of yuck all over it . Then when we ordered the rainbow bagel I was told it would be ready when we order it .. so when I got them they were not fresh !  I think they were frozen or something and they defrost . Nothing to write home about - and def not what NY bagels are about . Def don't waist your $ here . Sorry .

I passed here on my first week of commuting to a new office and just had to stop in.  It is very similar to other Bagel Boss locations I've tried (ie Queens and Long Island).  

My favorite spreads are their lox cream cheese, scallion cream cheese, and any smoked lox for that matter.  The rainbow colored bagels were fun to look at and I'm sure are delicious but I stuck with my tried and true favorite, toasted everything bagel with lox cream cheese.

Service was super quick and they knew how to move the lines quickly.  I'm glad I happened upon it by accident."

Asked for well toasted and she didn't listen to anything I said, just the few key words i guess lol. she kept going back and forth w coworkers and even asked a customer to imagine working at ""a place like this"" which was pretty funny but just unprofessional. def need to reconsider the type of personalities you hire as theyre youre representation as a bagel store. bagel and coffee were ok, nothing to boast"

Family owned and run. Rainbow bagels and fun cream cheese flavors. I recommend to all my family, friends, and coworkers.

The Details: Bagels, pizza, and 24/7 diners are the epitome of the New York food scene for yours truly. I'm a simple woman who enjoys delicious food at reasonable prices where the staff and management is pleasant. Is that so much to ask for? Bagel Boss went above and beyond all my expectations. When ordering for a large corporate group, they helped customize the order to my needs, delivered incredible food on time, still warm, and set up in beautiful baskets for my group. Cannot say enough great things about this spot. From a large corporate event, hungover group bagel order, or a quick bacon egg and cheese after a run-- do yourself a favor and stop at Bagel Boss.

Pro Tip: They have RAINBOW BAGELS! They were extremely accommodating for PRIDE orders in June. Any place that is LGBT friendly is a place I want to support.

The Damage: Extremely reasonable for all things breakfast and lunch. Extremely large bagels and generous breakfast sandwiches. Go go go!"
991,bagel-boss-murray-hill-new-york,2019-01-18,2.0,"This place is bad all around.  Let's count the way:

1) Customer service is terrible.  I've stopped in a couple times, and it seems like the people working there have no idea whats going on.  The girl working the register seemed to be more interested in snapchat than letting me pay for my food.  

Further, last time I was in there, they messed up both mine & my GF order.  Not sure how they could do that considering we were the only people there.  

2) Bagels are meh and the sides are awful.  there's nothing profound about the bagels that would justify the bad service or price.  Further, the sides offered are really bad.  

3) Place is dirty.  Last time I went in, all the tables had crumbs and left over trash on them.  Again, we were the only people in there, so not sure why Bagel Boss didn't have the capacity to clean at least one table up.  

Overall, this place is a huge no for me, and do not recommend.  I would give it 1 star, but I reserve that rating for places that either get me sick or have ripped me off."

I was told they only had soy sausage, which I accepted due to being in a rush. While paying, I saw the total of $9. When I asked why so much, she said it was extra for avocado. (Note: no coffee - just the cost of the sandwich) 

I got to my office and was pretty sad when I took the sandwich wrapping off. When you see the photo, it may bring you to tears as well. $9 for that avocado portion? Where is it? 

Overpriced and not good. Go one block over to bagel express. Half the cost and so much better!"

This time, I ordered a breakfast bagel (plain bagel with sausage, egg, and tomato). It was by far the ickiest breakfast sandwich I've had. The tomato slice was barely half a slice and most likely going bad. I overheard the guys in the back yell to the front saying that they don't have anymore tomatoes. Which makes me wonder where they got this slice of tomato from. I removed the tomato and even so the sandwich was bad. I had to use a lot of ketchup to try to mask the flavor and the mushy bagel. It was $5, and I didn't want to waste my money.

We also ordered the bagel boss plate, which came with 2 eggs any style on their bagel, home fries, orange juice and coffee.  The coffee was watered down. The orange juice was fine (it was the little cartons from Tropicana). The sandwich was as bad as the one I ordered - mushy bagel, egg shell in the egg and really disgusting tomato.

Do not buy your bagels here if you're a fan of New York bagels.  Real bagels aren't made with sugar.  That's not how a good bagel should be. Nor do people need sugar in bread products.

Perhaps this chain started somewhere else in the country where they don't make proper NY bagels.  In any event there are a few other bagel stores right nearby with real bagels without sugar."

The outside is sprinkled with oats. This is a no-nonsense joint and they get you through the line and out the door quickly, which is exactly what I need from a bagel joint when I heading out to work in the morning.

The bagels were as photographic as I had imagined and were super fresh. I'm pretty sure they were plain bagels, but other yelpers said they were blueberry. I'm not sure, since the blue berry cream cheese was lathered on so thickly a flavor was indistinguishable. I always forget to ask for it to be put on lightly!

I also ordered a large iced coffee, but again, was too heavy on the cream and sugar. There isn't a place to do it on your own, so I was at their mercy.

We stooped here, and let me tell ya, we were not disappointed! I had a plain bagel with vegetable schmear and it was delicious! My family couldn't stop raving about the food. The prices are very reasonable, too- I think it was roughly $3 for my bagel, which was a great price because the bagel was HUGE! I couldn't finish it (even though I wanted to)! I would definitely come back here- I've heard wonderful things about their ""flagel"" (a flattened bagel), and would definitely love to try that. All-in-all, if you're looking for a speedy, delicious, and reasonably-priced NYC bagel, this is your place!"

While the bagel itself has a decent chew, the main disappointing factor is the super liquidy cream cheese. The rainbow bagel was like a plain bagel in flavor fyi.

Service is friendly!"
991,bagel-boss-murray-hill-new-york,2017-06-26,5.0,"Yoooo Bagel Boss, you guys are the boss!

Had Bagel Boss who delivered to our office for a big Pride event. Rainbow bagels + birthday cake frosting.

Too legit to quit!

Bagels were chewy, warm, and delicious. Cream cheese wasn't too sweet which I like, because frosting at 9 am might make me a little bit cray cray.

They're one of the few shops in NYC who can do a massive order, execute beautifully, and deliver promptly. Really enjoyed the goodies and will definitely get them to cater future events!"
991,bagel-boss-murray-hill-new-york,2016-12-11,3.0,"It's a bit of a frenzy in there with people ordering and paying in the same spot. I ordered two bagels with egg and cheese. The bagel itself was pretty good. However, if you don't know what you want, you'll have a hard time figuring out what bagels they have since there are no labels. 

It hit the spot before strolling around the city.  
It was nearby and convenient. Staff was friendly and looked clean."

For a Friday morning during the rush hour frenzy, it wasn't too packed.  They have a large assortment of bagels and pastries as well as an oatmeal bar where you can choose milk or water-based oats with your choice of toppings, pretty cool!  I ordered a multigrain flat with schmear and it was great.  Just a heads up guys, this place is kosher so it's not your bacon-egg-and-cheese spot, but if you're looking for lox, spreads, and anything not from a pig, I'd recommend coming here.

The only thing that kept me from giving Bagel Boss a full five stars was the service, which was painfully slow, but other than that I think I've found my Friday carbicide spot!"

992,pret-a-manger-new-york-23,2017-12-06,4.0,"Was always a fan of Pret...I'm surprised my Yelp check-in's were so few.  Oh well, must've forgotten to check in.  At any rate, always fresh choices and always good food finds here.  It is a chain so at the least, they are consistent!  

My most recent visit, I discovered some hot entrees that I didn't notice before.  I bought the spinach and tomato mac and cheese...it was super creamy and delish.  Portion seemed to appear small but after I finished it, it really hit the spot.  

I was also pleasantly surprised by their hot wraps, packaged in a convenient peel and eat type holder, very easy to eat on the go.  It also stayed quite ""hot"" so I liked that feature the best given we are now in Winter.  The one I've sampled and thoroughly enjoyed, the Buffalo Chicken wrap...nice pieces of chicken and the wrap was soft and everything stayed moist.  And it never tasted overcooked...that's important when the food just sits.  

The turnaround on the items is quick too so if you have a favorite, do run to get it.  My signature lunch is a half sandwich and soup combo or when I'm feeling very hungry (quite often, LOL), I'd get a full sandwich and small soup.  Either way, it is fast and savory.  Am a fan.  Totally."

992,pret-a-manger-new-york-23,2017-02-03,1.0,I've been working nearby for the last 5 years. Every time I go to this location it's either they over charge me (they confuse what type of sandwich it is) or give me the ugliest croissant ever. I'm always pissed of after being there and today couldn't keep it for myself. I buy croissants for me and my colleague every Friday and I always have no luck with these people. I haven't been there for a month and when I went today it was same thing. Very disappointing. I unfortunately didn't have time to see what he gave me as I was in a rush. I think they don't care about their customers.

I'm that type of person that has to eat a little bit in the morning or else my stomach would growl or just start cramping :( Luckily, my office had a Pret literally right downstairs. I've never had a bad experience here either! Great, fresh food that's made daily and very kind employees. Every morning I was greeted with a smile and they worked very efficiently. Whether I was ordering a latte, a tea, or buying a sandwich, I would be in and out in less than a minute (given that there is no line). I really recommend any of their sandwiches. I forgot which ones I've tried but they're all good! Their morning hot sandwiches are also really great, and will make your co-workers jealous ;) As for coffee, I really like their lattes and their new pommegranate green tea is amazing on those hot days."

They have lots of options such as full/ half sandwiches, healthy snacks (love their granola yogurt, quinoa with hard boiled egg & spinach leaves ), soups (Moroccan lentil is hearty and delicious) , salads (tuna and avocado), The food is always consistently SO fresh & delicious. The staff is always friendly & happy. They always have new food options too (lobster salads and sandwiches when they are in season)."
992,pret-a-manger-new-york-23,2013-12-16,2.0,"This place is across the street from a client's office, so in a pinch and on the few occasions when the admin didn't order in awesome deli, I have grabbed a few sandwiches from here. All were unremarkable and overpriced. And the calorie count they provide on the signs along with the list of ingredients is just frightening. On the other hand, that usually gets me to do an extra 30 minutes on the elliptical that night. 

My opinion is that Pret a Manger is a decent safety if you are passing out hungry or it's near your office and the weather sucks. Otherwise, find an alternative.

I enjoyed their ham and cheese sandwich-- apart from that the place is somewhat small and not the best place to go for a group lunch, nor is it cheap. However, it does the job and hits the spot in all other regards. Service was good, food selection was fresh and can definitely satisfy any appetite that walks in."
992,pret-a-manger-new-york-23,2014-01-08,5.0,"Luckily this location is closest to my office, as it is one of the cleanest and friendliest locations! Nearly every person at this location is cheery and helpful.

They get busy from 12-230 but the lines move fast and they keep the shelves stocked; although they occasionally run out of my fav (buffalo chicken wrap) around 2-3pm. They have a nice arrangement of seating at this location from high top tables with stools, to booths, to low bar seating by the window. The booths are usually occupied but when you get the chance to snag one do it! It is really cozy here especially during the colder months."
992,pret-a-manger-new-york-23,2013-07-23,3.0,Came here the other day and asked for the vegan mexican lentil soup. it was very thick. It must have been the same pot from the morning and had soaked up all the liquid. I was not happy with it. The service was nice though.
992,pret-a-manger-new-york-23,2013-04-06,3.0,"This Pret location is conveniently located in a corporate area.  So if I'm in a rush for lunch, I can go in and grab one of their ready boxed sandwiches.  The sandwich making materials could be purchased at your local supermarket, and you yourself could make a sandwich that is substantially similar.  You could view the sandwich as pricey since it's cheaper to make it yourself, or you could tell yourself that you're paying for the convenience.  (I waver between the two.)  

I do like the fact they use Mighty Leaf tea though.  The price for a small cup of tea is about the same as that at Starbucks and other local delis.  However, the brand of tea Pret is using is of a much higher quality."
992,pret-a-manger-new-york-23,2012-05-16,2.0,"I LOVE Pret a Manger, let me say that first.  The food and drinks are always fresh and delicious, and the staff at all locations is uncommonly friendly.  I'm reviewing this Pret as compared to the other Prets I've been to.

I usually go to this Pret in the morning on my way to work.  Note that I am rushing because I am always late.  But more than that, when I go somewhere for a coffee and a bagel (their Energy bagels are delish, and a warm, just-baked one is a real treat!!), I don't expect to spend multiple minutes waiting around, unless there is a line.

First of all, they only have one person at the register at around 10 AM, and the restaurant is not quite empty at that time, what with all the diplomats and Midwestern and European families milling about.  Usually, that one person on the register is chit-chatting with the manager or whoever else (who does not open up a register and help, even if there is a line), and usually, that one person also has to make the coffee drinks, serve tea, etc., which makes things take even longer.  I would guess, however, that the fact that there is only one person at the register in the morning is not his/her fault.  Poor management would be to blame for that.  The idle chit-chat, even when it is busy, would be a strike against management as well as the register ""team"".

And here I'd like to emphasize once more how remarkably nice Pret folks are.  It hurts a little to have to write a less than glowing review...

Second, out of the 5 coffee urns available for self-serve, most every morning, two will be empty.  On a really bad day, the other two urns are almost out.  Or what's left is full of grounds.  The fifth urn is decaf, which really doesn't count.  Most Pret locations will have pitchers of skim milk, whole milk, half/half and sometimes soy milk on both sides of the urns.  This Pret has them only on one side, meaning that most mornings I have to wait for other folks to fix their coffee (and they are not as quick as I am, just saying).  I sometimes have to ask for skim milk, and they bring it out in a flash.

My advice to the morning staff at this Pret:  tighten up your ish, folks.  Other Pret locations run like well-oiled machines.  There's no reason you shouldn't."
992,pret-a-manger-new-york-23,2013-08-13,5.0,"This is my favorite location. The service is amazing and the food is wonderful. New menu hits it out of the park. Great vegan, vegetarian and low calorie selections too. Everything is freshly made and no detail goes overlooked. Need to cram something in your face fast the spicy shrimp wrap is delicious. Want something ""sinful"" the hot falafel sandwich hits the spot. Want to forget your eating hunched over your desk in your office, the Niçoise salad is restaurant quality. This must be a great place to work too. Every person who wears the Pret name tag in this local is happy really happy, I always leave feeling way better than when I walked in. Super heroes on 3rd ave!
 One call out the soups tend to be on the salty side. They are low in fat and we all know fat equals flavor so they overcompensate with the salt. Just a watch out if your trying to cut back on salt."
992,pret-a-manger-new-york-23,2009-05-14,4.0,"""The city"" brought me to the east side of Manhattan today. I was on the E train and got off at Lexington&53rd. 

I was about to go into Crumbs for kawfee and I see this place Pret. What a nice looking store! 

I go inside and they have polished stainless steel, brown tiles, very masculine looking. (And may your first child be a masculine child) 

The sandwiches are pre-made (I'm not a fan of that) and all the drinks are lined up and dispensed looking like little solders. 

I get a cup of organic coffee and a harvest nut cookie that the cookie alone sold for $1.75 (hey, I'm a sucker for baked goods) 

Nice looking place and the coffee was good. I'm a fan!

Oh yeah - and the food is delicious and fresh.  Oh I said that already.  Really inventive and tasty sandwiches, perfectly chilled on fresh bread.  And they use arugula where appropriate, which is a big deal in my book.  

Thanks for opening near my office.
My only request is that they bring back the comfy leather chairs.  I have no idea why they took them away but its a big loss."

At around 2pm today I went in for a snack. I purchased a chocolate chip cookie ($1.95) and was given a burnt cookie. I asked if there were any other not so burnt cookies or was any freshly baked cookies coming out soon. The male Asian cashier who got the cookie for me originally asked me in a sarcastic tone ""shouldn't the cookie look dark?"" The female AA cashier went and got a fresh cookie when she realized I wasn't leaving without a less burnt cookie. With an almost aggressive demeanor she removed the pan of fresh cookies from the oven, dropped it on the back countertop, took my cookie bag, slide out my burnt cookie and used a - WAIT FOR IT - coffee cup sleeve to pick up the hot baked cookie and placed it in my cookie bag!!!! Then placed it on the counter. She didn't even hand it to me. I won't be back!"

This Pret is in my office building, and I had to make a mad dash for food before the work started to pile up again. I had a chicken cobb salad, a cup of fruit, and an orange juice. All very fresh -- even my avocado half was just right.

My only beef with this place? I somehow spent $16 on all of those things. omiGAHHHH! (Insert British currency conversion rate joke here)"
992,pret-a-manger-new-york-23,2012-03-16,2.0,"I do not get all the love for this particular Pret.  It has gone way down since it opened.  It has a staff that chatters away in the early morning, pretty much ignoring the customers, a manager who puts his fingers in his mouth and then on the food as he bags/rings up the orders, and a steady drop in quality.  In the last month I've gotten an egg salad with shells in it, a mislabled toasty, a long, shiny black hair in my chicken caesar salad, and an eyeroll when I complained about it.  Since there is pretty much a Pret every two blocks in midtown, I'm skipping this location from now on.  The extra block walk won't kill me."

i got the mild obsession with pret when i was visiting england. and i was really happy that the brits brought pret to the us. pret in england is considered fairly cheap, but it doesn't seem to be true in the states probably because of the currency conversion. a regular-sized sandwich is $6. (two pieces of square bread and some stuff in between..)
but it's so good though...somehow. the selection is not as great as the british pret. but good enough to make me happy.

plus, free wifi! even though there's no power outlet. but free wifi in new york is not exactly easy to find. (and yes i am using their wifi to write this review)"

993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2019-04-21,5.0,"Perfect petite
Pearls of plump pastel 
Euro pastries 

Giving this shop 5 stars + a happy haiku. This is now one of my BEST rainy spring saturday memories in nyc. Top is off with a beautiful tram ride to roosevelt island (1 block away, just a metro swipe!)

The staff were courteous, extremely knowledgable, and pleasant. The menu is limited but as the old adage says... less is more! And this is *very* true here. 

Espresso:

Use the advice I was given and order an espresso with little milk. I ordered a decaf espresso with a dollop of milk dotted on top. The sweetness of the pastries are a wonderful compliment to the soft acidity of the espresso. 

Sweets:

The staff educated me on this one too... keep in mind that a cake is a bigger piece, like an after dinner sweet. There is a more balanced ratio if cake vs. frosting. The petite fours are meant as tiny bites for a tasty burst of intense flavor. 

Lavender is amazing but be sure you are really committed to this flavor otherwise you might find it medicinal or soapy. I loved it!!

Lemon is also clean and bright but sweet and creamy. Likewise, be sure you enjoy the citrus family before you snack on this one!

Vanilla (bourbon vanilla) is the least unusual but also deliciously delicate and delectable! And such a pretty blue.

Rose is very floral and very soft. This is an uncommon flavors for most American palettes but SUCH a delight! 

Coffee is a comfy and familiar mini cake. It was a bit too sweet for me with the frosting but would be great for those who love the spongey soaked insides of tiramisu."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2019-10-01,2.0,"I love petit fours (pronounced petty foo, as the sales woman was kind enough to point out), but these didn't do it for me. Maybe they're just too fancy, maybe they are the authentic version of the French pastry and I only like the Americanized versions I've had - I'm honestly not sure. 

The marzipan on top was perfect, but out of the four flavors I tried I only liked one. The lavender (purple) was too overpowering, it was like eating a flower. The rose (pink) was also too floral, but not as much as the lavender was. The coffee (brown) was also so aggressive it was like you were actually drinking a cup of joe. I guess most people like that but for me it was too concentrated. 

I'm pretty sure the blue petit four was their bourbon vanilla and this I absolutely loved. Didn't taste the bourbon, just vanilla. A box of these would be delicious. Another reviewer recommended REALLY liking the flavor of whatever you're getting otherwise you won't appreciate it and I strongly second that. 

Petit fours are usually expensive, a box of 4 came to $13.50. About the same price per little cake as Balthazar Boulangerie (whose petit fours I prefer, although they only sell them by the dozen and they come in one flavor - almond/vanilla). 

The woman working the counter was friendly and helpful, and the setting is adorable. Frilly, full of pastels and whimsy. It wasn't for me but it might be for you!"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2019-11-11,5.0,This is a fancy little pastry shop with really cute decor. They specialize in petits four. They are decorated really nice with pretty cream flowers. So much hard word by hand. All of the petits four flavors except for coffee cream had alcohol. The coffee petit four was nice. You can get coffee or tea from Juilius Meinl to go with the cakes.
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2019-01-05,5.0,"Came here on a Saturday, it was very quiet with just a very nice girl working. I had ordered the Vanilla Petit square and a macchiato..they only serve hot drinks in the winter I was told, and so I couldn't order a cold iced coffee drink. When walking inside I had very much liked the interior as it was pretty cute with the clear chairs etc. 

Everything was served in very cute fine china. We sat against the wall where there was a table with a cute brown couch chair. 

As for the petit square, it was very sweet. It's a very small cake type of desert. If you don't like sweet things I wouldn't recommend ordering these! I found it to be quite delicious:)"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2019-09-06,5.0,We came to Bon Vivant for our wedding petit fours. Absolutely exquisite and we certainly made the right choice. Super easy to transport and presentation is gorgeous. All of the flavors were our favorite. There is no wrong choice! Thank you so much!
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2018-11-27,4.0,"The most perfect petit fours I have tasted.  They are not overly sweet and the texture of the frosting is like none other I have tasted. Usually when other places attempt to make them, they are too sugary.  This place has mastered the technique and delivers it on a silver platter, literally.  The place is also cute and IG friendly.  Definitely a good spot to catch up with friends or to just enjoy some alone time!"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2018-09-19,5.0,"Super cute place! I got 4 petite cakes with a pot of Jasmin green tea. I really liked the petite cakes, the inside was really moist. I got one of each flavor and my favorite was the rose petal. Would definitely come back for more cake! This place is quite instagram worthy. Also, the price isn't bad for a place a few blocks away from the upper east side."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2018-08-24,5.0,"Excellent place for petit fours.   The cake is spongy and the icing is perfect.  We tried the lavender, the rose, and the lemon zest flavors.  All were decadent and delightful.  We also gave a box of four to some friends as a gift.  The box was beautifully arranged.  And my friends thoroughly enjoyed the treats.  If you are in the neighborhood... be sure to pop in for a coffee and a nummy petit four."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2019-09-20,5.0,"OMG I just found this cake shop and I'm so bummed because I'm leaving New York City!  This is the perfect place if you want to go for a little cup of afternoon tea and a treat, if you have a visitor from away and want to show them a bit of the city, or if you want to bring a little sweetness to a birthday party or happiness to a friend on a hard day! The cakes come in a little bite size or a couple bites worth and you can get a box of them made for a gift and they are so darn PRETTY ! They are so moist and the flavors are unique and delicious (my favorites are the rose and lavender but I haven't tasted the lemon yet because they always run out by the time I get there )."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2019-06-27,1.0,"Thurs night, long hot day in NYC, ~ $20 coffee and cake, then he would not give me a water.  #uncool"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-06-24,5.0,"Great service. Good coffee. Amazing pastries. You can't go wrong.

I ordered a cappuccino. My sister is gawking over the pastries and awaiting her latte and croissant.

Petit Four Demitasse - Lavender, rose, vanilla, coffee. Delicious."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-06-16,4.0,"Her petite fours are pretty and delicate looking.  They offer about 4-5 types of flavors.  Petite fours are tiny cakes.  I bought the lemon cake with lemon custard and a marzipan topped with liquid fondant frosting.  It's very expensive.  Over $5 for the  tiny piece and $2.99 for the even tinier piece about an inch in size.  That one is the size of a piece of chocolate you can gulp in one bite.

It is good quality but annoy pricey.

They've. Rem there 7 months since today."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2018-12-18,5.0,"This is one of our favorite haunts. If you're in Midtown East or Upper East Side, this is the place to visit to get the most amazing petit cake or petit fours. We always get decaf lattes and take out time to really enjoy every sip of this unusual and quality coffee and each morsel of these delicious cakes. We enjoyed Bon Vivant when they were located across the street and they haven't missed a beat with the move. Take my advice on this -- stop by or order from their website. It's so worth it. (I have no skin in this game. This is a completely unsolicited positive review.)"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2019-03-30,5.0,"This shop is right around near my in-laws' apartment, and my MIL brought us some cakes when she visited for our daughter's first birthday. The cakes are SO beautiful (even after being transported on an airplane) and also so delicious. I feel like fancy pastries often sacrifice taste for appearance or vice versa, but these cakes knock it out of the park on both metrics. They currently offer five flavors (coffee, vanilla, rose, lavender and lemon). My MIL bought us a sampler box of four and correctly opted to omit lemon. The coffee was by far my favorite, since that's my favorite of those flavors, but all the cakes were good and the named flavor was distinct but not overwhelming. As a chocoholic, my only complaint is that they really need a chocolate flavor. I look forward to visiting in person on my next trip to NY."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2019-02-16,5.0,"This place is adorable. The petit fours are to die for. If you love anything lemon flavored like I do, then I highly recommend their lemon petit fours- so moist and delicious. What is also outstanding is their coffee! I'm still thinking about it. Definitely the best cup of coffee I've had in NYC. Soo smooth and not bitter at all. They use a Viennese roast blend from a company called Julius Mienl. If you are shopping around Bloomingdales and need a pick me up, definitely stop here!"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2016-12-28,1.0,"I will write this review a million times if I have to (the last one was reported by the business), the management in this place is horrible. They don't know crap about customer service. Treated me horribly when I was there and even took my review personally by threatening to fire my friend cause i gave them bad review.

The cakes are tiny, overly priced, and not worth it at all. And to top it off, you'll get treated horribly. 

DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-05-10,5.0,"Sublime, just sublime. I am now addicted to their lavender petit four but they really are all good . It's pricey but the experience of the taste and the ambiance are worth it. There is jutting else like it in the immediate area . The small ones are perfect to take home for a tea party or just as a good looking dessert to have after a light meal .
The service is impeccable and consistent .
The larger petit four are a bit more moist and great if you want to indulge yourself ."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2015-03-13,5.0,"I ordered cakes for my fiancé's birthday when we started dating. Both families met for the first time and I needed to make sure the cake I selected was perfect.
I got petit cakes in different flavors spelling out happy birthday. Everyone was very impressed by the originality of the birthday cakes. Also, the family has food restrictions and are allergic to the flour processed in the US. I knew that the cakes were high end and the flour used for them was special and from France so they could eat it.
Taste: the cakes are small and beautiful. They have just the right amount of sweetness and I am always amazed how a flavor like lavender can be locked into a pastry this well.
The petite cakes are a bit pricier compared to other pastries, but in my opinion they are worth it. It's a beautiful, tasty, original and different product."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-03-29,4.0,"Such a well decorated little coffee and dessert shop! It reminds me of something you would find in Paris with desserts on display, mirrored wall, and a cute little chandelier. There are about three tiny tables will a nice window seat. Perfect to grab a quick dessert and coffee with a friend or to go. Coffee was pretty good, it had a great taste and it was well steamed. 
I recommend the cappuccino. I appreciate the lids of the coffee cup which makes it easy to drink out of. We also tried one of their small cakes. The cake was moist and delicious! Well at least the dough was, but the icing wasn't very good. I ended up eating the insides of the cake without the icing, which was good quality and pretty heavy. 
Service was really great and the barista was so sweet! This place is worth checking out if your looking for a nice place to grab coffee."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-10-06,4.0,"Quiant, cute and cozy cafe with elegant marzipan petit fours! Friendly service, too. Came in almost when they were about to close but they still welcomed us! Will defibitely come back!"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-08-10,5.0,Gourgeous small Parisian-esq cafe in Midtown East. They specialize in little square cakes in many flavors. I had the rose petal and it was delicious. They also have a fine selection of tea and coffee. Would absolutely recommend.
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-03-31,5.0,"This place is such a beautiful hidden gem. Best cappuccino I've had and The tiny cakes are to die for. I tried both the Rose and Lavender flavors. I wanted to wolf them down in two bites, but they tasted so beautiful and intense that I spread out enjoying them over a half hour. Beautiful!"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2016-12-02,5.0,The lavender and coffee petitfour were each AMAZING!!!! The café noisette was really smooth and now one of my favorite coffee. This place is a must visit if you love desserts and coffee. The coffee is high quality. I wish they had a shop like this close to where I live. I will definitely order petites fours online from here for my upcoming events.
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2018-04-26,5.0,So beautiful and so delicious! I would definitely go out of my way to get one of these little cakes. And a very special little place to have coffee and cake and hang out with a friend.
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2018-12-19,4.0,"I love this little cafe. The coffee is Viennese - Julius Meinl - and lovely, and the petits fours are wonderful. The music was a bit random and loud on a weekday morning (radio, turned up with loud commercials) but that can be overlooked given the general awesomeness of the coffee, cakes and environment."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2018-06-09,5.0,"Wow! Had never heard of this place before but happened to walk by and the pretty decor and petit fours lured me in. I purchased one each of the three petit four flavors they had available. Got home and was absolutely blown away at how moist and flavorful (yet light!) they each were. Loved all three flavors (vanilla, rose, lavender).  In terms of consistency and taste they reminded me of some of the better cakes I had while in Sweden (sigh, if anyone knows where I can get a good princesstorte in nyc, lmk!). Really tempted to go back and pick up more...  Beautiful packaging too, would make great gifts. They are a bit pricey for the size but they're really delicious and stand out amongst other sweets options in the city. Great customer service, too. Highly recommend!"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-12-03,5.0,"Great place for petit fours. Ashish, one of the owners is very nice.  Great espresso too. IMHO, the best thing there is the Lavender Petit Four....tastes amazing."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2016-10-17,5.0,"As an employee cashier/barista working in Bon vivant is Incredibly amazing! I love the place and the people is very nice also the customers has been very welcoming! Everyone should come by for some pastry, or some petit fours or an individuals petit cake! , and along with that a beautiful espresso! I love working here"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2016-05-08,5.0,"Bon Vivant is incredible. The petit fours are just divine.  But even more than that the customer service is fantastic! They made sure my delivery got to me just in time. I appreciate the quality of service so much. 

You MUST try these cakes if you haven't already. I can't wait for the brick & mortar shop."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-04-17,5.0,I love petit fours and this was a great place!  I think there is a lemon option that was lovely.  Highly recommended!
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-03-06,5.0,What a great find in New York City. A beautiful little coffee shop where I had the most decadent hot cocoa and chocolate croissant in my life.
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-03-06,5.0,"A lovely little cafe serving divine cakes - reminds one of an old world pastry shop.  I had the Rose petit cake with Earl Grey tea -  it was  heavenly.
Highly recommend - a great place to meet a friend or to relax after shopping in Midtown."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-04-22,5.0,"I can't believe I walked by this place so many times without entering, what a gem!! This place should be full all day, every day. The innocent looking pastries were clearly made by a frenchman, what a delight. Probably the best in the city.

Ashish took care of us, was friendly, professional and demonstrated barista skills that are so rare in NYC and the US in general. The Melange (cappuccino) was served in the right temperature and texture and so was the hot chocolate.

Some improvement suggestions:
1. If this place starts serving some light French food like sandwiches or quiches, I would come 3-4 times a week. You have my word.
2. Some of the lights in the cafe are flickering, it would be great if you can fix that.


We will be back."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-09-30,5.0,What an awesome little cafe tucked away in the hustle and bustle of Midtown. Great vibes!
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2016-12-21,5.0,"I actually never write reviews on Yelp, but I was truly amazed at how ornate each pastry was decorated. I got the Box of 16 assorted petit cakes as a gift for my boss and boy was I impressed. Highly recommend and definitely will be going back!!!"
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2016-10-18,5.0,The espresso is amazing and you have to try the petite fours. I'm not sure which is my favorite but it's probably the lavender or the vanilla. It's like being in Paris!
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-02-15,1.0,Way too expensive for the quality and amount you get. There are so many other great dessert places located in NYC that are fairly priced. Not worth wasting your time and money here. Don't recommend it at all.
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2018-07-05,5.0,Just received as a gift a lovely box filled with a dozen of the most beautiful petit four.  What a delicious surprise both for the eyes and the tastebuds.   Bravo to you Bon Vivant!!
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2015-03-07,4.0,"Love Love Love their cakes. I had the celebration cake and it was delivered on time the next day. 
All the flavors were delicious. My favorite was the Lavender bloom and the Vanilla. The cakes were rich and moist- really good. 
I would call them and order again."
993,bon-vivant-new-york-new-york-3,2017-12-01,5.0,Absolutely wonderful petit fours and service. I ordered five boxes of the vanilla and lemon for Thanksgiving. They were delivered on time as promised and were a huge hit with the family!
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-10-13,4.0,"This place has the best granola bar I have ever had! I don't know if they are homemade but they are on point. They kinda fell apart but they were awesome. 

You can only fit about 2 people on this coffee shop at a time but you can get in and out quickly. I like the concept and the staff was friendly and attentive. I would definitely come back even though I am not a coffee drinker."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-09-18,4.0,"We were vintage hunting nearby and came across Brooklyn Diamond by a happy accident. It's a newer coffee shop that's highly walkable in the neighborhood. Its credit card only, so leave your cash at home!

I loved their modern vibe and the stellar fringe art installation hanging on the main wall. They also had a CBD pop-up happening in the back that was just plainly very cool. I tried the matcha and was so pleased with its earthy, raw, and refreshing flavor. We sat down for a little bit and definitely got a sense of Brooklyn Diamond's trendy atmosphere. They have a fairly extensive menu with plenty of options for non-coffee drinkers like me!

I feel like I can't accurately comment on my traditional coffee shop musings because I wasn't there using the wi-fi or working for a long period time. I mostly rate every coffee shop five stars, but four stars on this because they don't have a working restroom which is a bummer when you're drinking coffee. Otherwise, cute place!"
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-11-12,4.0,"Great coffee!!! Very small cafe next to Soul Cycle but it's open early which is great. My cappuccino was served deliciously hot and strong. I also had a cranberry scone that wasn't super sweet and rather yummy. they also had croissants, and cookies in their case (Balthazar's). Would totally come again if in the area."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-02-16,5.0,"This coffee is divine. Somehow with no added syrup it's still subtlety sweet - I wasn't paying attention and my latte disappeared in minutes.

The shop is tiny and only fits 3-4 people standing. Definitely somewhere to grab a cup and head out."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-07-11,4.0,"So many coffee shops in NYC.. how does one choose? Well, if you're looking for an adorable teeny tiny coffee shop to grab a killer beverage, I recommend this place. I stumbled across it on yelp and am glad I found it. I arrived bright & early before heading to the airport for my flight home. I went with an almond milk latte, which was absolutely delicious. Wish I had time to try the cold brew, but I'll save that experience for next time!"
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-06-21,3.0,Stopped by here to grab a drink while waiting for someone. There was no seating inside so I sat on the bench outside. Got the large iced matcha latte with oat milk. There wasn't nearly enough matcha so I really felt like I was drinking milk. Luckily it was only $2 because I was using the ritual app July $1 coffee promo.
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-09-25,5.0,"The baristas are wizards. The smallest coffee shop I've ever been to. When you walk in you're already face to face with the barista. This place might be tiny but it packs a punch. Their prices are reasonable, things like oat milk- are extra. I order an iced latte with oat milk and hazelnut syrup. (So much better than almond milk- which they don't use.) Iced drinks come in 2 sizes, hot drinks come in 3. Let me just say I couldn't resist drinking it before taking a photo."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-10-27,5.0,"Strong cold brew..... 

There are a lot of coffee options in the area from Dunkin and Starbucks to food carts but this place is the best. It's tiny, 3 people max can stand in their cafe which means you in and out in a minute. They only take card which is cool with me but take that into account before you go. Keep it up and as a new regular I appreciate you guys making my morning just a little bit better!"
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-04-02,4.0,Nice staff here. Excellent large cappuccino though it is La Colombe and for 4.50 plus tax it's well worth it  Very small place. Good local coffee place. 4.3
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2017-07-02,5.0,"Stopped by for iced chai...perfect day, too hot for words. The shop is super small with no tables, but a great, friendly staff.

Our iced chai was delish. You could taste the spices with a predominant cardamom flavor! What a treat! We'll be back!"
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-02-20,5.0,"Stopped by here on my first day of work uptown. The lady behind the counter was super nice. The coffee was very fairly priced, $4 for quite a hefty cup. And holy crap that stuff was strong, and damn good. Some of the best cold brew I have had in the city. Really nice dark roasted flavor without being bitter. Thats always the key to a killer brew. And damn this stuff was straight engine oil, which if you're like me thats the secret sauce. Definitely will be back soon. No reason to go anywhere else in turtle bay."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-02-09,5.0,"Cortado with oat milk was a great match with this glorious Saturday. James inside was as warm as the heater, and cool as the music playing. Please enjoy the shimmer that is the Brooklyn Diamond."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-08-08,5.0,Kareem was such a good barista! I got the advertised lemon ginger iced tea with oatly. So yummy. I appreciate you all selling metal straws as well
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2020-01-14,1.0,I don't normally write reviews but I am a bit upset for ordering a mocha mint latte for $5.72 and it has absolutely no mint taste. It became a cup of expensive mocha.
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-01-26,5.0,"Had a specialty cold brew here, oat milk, almond milk, coconut milk and some hazelnut syrup. Wow! So smooth and not overly sweet. Great combo!!!

I love coming here cause the vibe is so great and they're always playing good music. 

Come here for some of the best cold brew in the city!"
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-11-12,4.0,"The coffee is good and just a bit cheaper than the coffee shops around it. My only concern is the inconsistency- I've had really good and bad latte/cappuccinos. The interior will only hold 3-4 people comfortably, so it's more of a grab and go place."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-11-18,3.0,"I live for Lola Colombe coffee, and this place has tons of it. The service is also friendly and quick (thanks to no cash) so five stars for that. I love the punch card idea, but I would love an app even better since I never remember my card. 

I only have two complaints:

1. The shop is a little small, with little being an understatement. Two customers can fit in here at one time before a line forms outside the door. Be mindful of that if you're coming on a rainy or particularly frigid day. 

2. Management,  if you are reading this, you absolutely must start sourcing your coffee cups and lids from another vendor. I've been here five times and each time the coffee drops from the lid while the lid is secured on the cup; it's annoying and it hurts. 

I probably won't buy more coffee made here 
 because of the cup issue but I'll buy your La Colombe coffee beans/ grounds to make at home."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-09-27,3.0,"I went here a few days ago and got a cold brew and an espresso on the side. 
The cold brew was good and the espresso cup was full to the brim...not good.
The staff wasn't friendly at all. 
I ordered the drinks and then pulled out a $20 to pay however, I was told so rudely by the barista that they don't take cash here. OOPS. Maybe they had a sign that I missed that said no cash is accepted but man...I walked away from that store feeling like I committed a crime by trying to pay with cash....
Nope not gonna come back here"
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2016-06-29,5.0,"MUST get the cold brew! (I recommend getting it with soy milk)

I can't stop raving about how delicious their cold brew is. It is definitely among some of the best cold brews that I have ever tasted. The flavor is very bold and smooth, exactly what I need to jump start my day. You can tell the quality of it just by looking at the deep shade in color. The store is very small so it is meant to strictly be a grab and go place. 

If you want to get the most bang for your buck, they also sell the cold brew packaged into big bottles (32 oz $15). It is highly concentrated and is enough to make about 8 servings, which is pretty worth it if you ask me! Don't forget to take advantage of the loyalty card that they offer as well!"
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-04-01,4.0,"""Don't let the door hit you in the ass"" has a literal meaning at this super tiny, counter-only coffee place.  I was barely in the door and I was already at the counter LOL.  High quality coffee. They only accept credit or debit cards."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-02-14,5.0,This is the best cup of coffee in midtown east.  You can make 3 glasses of cold brew with their small New Orleans.
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2016-07-19,4.0,"Amazing New Orleans style cold brew but the place is tiny. Hard to even add sugar to your coffee without feeling claustrophobic.

994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-01-25,1.0,"I don't usually write reviews, but my experience here was so bad that I was compelled to. Terrible matcha lattes that have no matcha powder at all. I paid $5 for lukewarm milk foam with sprinkles of matcha on top. My drink was made in less than 30 seconds, which was the quickest, most half-assed job I've ever seen.

The guy at the counter was incredibly rude and condescending (also came across racist, I am Asian-American) when I asked if they had the matcha cronuts I saw on this Yelp page. 

Me: ""Do you happen to have the matcha cronuts today?""
Him: ""I don't know what those are. Are they American?"" 
Me: ""I saw photos of them on your Yelp page.""
Him: ""I've never seen them before and I've been here for a year and a half.""

Maybe he should do some research on his own place of employment to get an understanding of his job and general feedback??? I am also 150% certain that a young guy like him living in NYC knows what ""matcha"" means, and what a ""cronut"" is. More importantly, there is no reason to be rude to customers. Completely unacceptable. I will definitely not be returning, and will not recommend this place to anyone.

PRO TIP TO THE BUSINESS OWNER: Don't post pretty Yelp photos of products that are not actually offered, and please train your employees to provide proper customer service/decent human behavior."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-02-07,5.0,"I own a business next door (DTX) and have been coming here since they opened. Usually get Americanos, which are great but the drip coffee is really good as well. Appreciate that they have almond milk and stevia. But as a business owner, though their product is really good, I gotta say, I really keep coming back because of the customer service. Everyone that works there is really friendly and great at their jobs. 

Also, I admit I'm writing this to counter the review that claimed someone that worked there seemed racist. I know the gentleman she is referring to. She couldn't be more wrong. I'm there almost daily and have seen him interact with all types of people with absolute respect. And by the way, though he lives in NYC, he is from England. And the guy you claim is racist to Asians? He lived in Korea, speaks Korean and has a Korean girlfriend. So, I guarantee you misinterpreted him. To her here's a PRO TIP: Be a little careful before you smear people on the internet."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-06-22,5.0,"This place has most amazing cold brew you will ever drink! It is so smooth and strong without being bitter. They have any kind of milk you can think of and while a small cold brew is $4.50, the cup size is probably the equivalent of a medium at Dunkin Donuts, so I don't feel like they're price gauging. The staff is very friendly too.

This location is tiny with no seating, so just keep that in mind if you're looking for a coffee shop to sit in. Also, they are cashless.

Glad that this place is far enough from my office that it's not too convenient to go to every day because otherwise I would!"

994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2019-07-25,3.0,"Ordered a Chai Latte here I was pretty disappointed overall with the layout of the store, pricing, etc. the store is half a studio apartment as the other reviews have said. It's so tiny. The drinks they offer here are pretty basic:latte, cortado, cold brew, etc. I was hoping for something a bit special in terms of something they make well. Pricing wise it's on the overpriced side ($5.44 for a large chai latte that's fair ish). My main issue is price: quality. The almond milk used was the Blue Diamond almond milk and the entire drink was basically milk. This brand of almond milk is what I use for my cereal.... not even to make lattes at home. And some chai syrup was just added to the drink in the end overall, I expect a more barista type of milk used for this price range. At this point, I will get my money's worth at Starbucks since it's milk+ syrup."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-04-23,5.0,"The best matcha ever! They actually listened to my note I added on my UberEats order, which was great. And James the British guy gave me a free croissant! Amazing"

Guys, you should never ever give your customer an attentude, especially if you coffee is just O.K. there's Little Collins right around the corner and Starbucks, if you must. There's no excuse for being dicks to your customers."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-04-23,2.0,"I got a macchiato. Huge bubbles. No latte art. It was one of the worst macchiato's I've ever had. Oh, and a HAIR was in the macchiato. You can see it here in a pic I posted. Look closely. They don't take cash either. The service was ok."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-11-14,5.0,"Dangerously good lattes. My go to's: Latte with oat milk and hazelnut syrup (thank me later), and the matcha latte with coconut milk. Make sure you get a little punch card on your way out because you'll definitely coming back!"
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-03-09,4.0,Tiny coffee shop next to a bunch of gyms. Great drinks. No seating / simply grab and go. Use the check in to get 20% off.
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2016-03-31,5.0,"Discovered this cute little place after reading through my friend's post - apparently I made a wise decision!

The coffee shop was so tiny that could not even hold a single table inside; however they sell a variety of stuff. What attracted me the most was the fruit chips - will for sure grab a bag next time!

Complex coffee, friendly staff!"
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2017-06-22,4.0,This is a cute little no seating coffee shop.  I picked up a delicious iced dirty chai for breakfast to enjoy with my authentic New York bagel.  It would be very convenient to stop in here on your way to work or when you are in a hurry.
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2015-12-31,3.0,The location is hidden away off of 2nd ave but very convenient for a quick fix of caffeine.  I always pick up a cup of Joe after I am finished with my workout even if I don't need it because I am already stimulated from my workout.  The coffee is tasty and the logo is amazingly cool.
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-01-18,3.0,"The coffee is not my favorite. It always tastes burnt but it's very convenient and fast. It is not a sit down place, it is more like a take away window."
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2017-06-03,5.0,Coffee and service was amazing. Looking forward to the best cold brew in midtown everyday.
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2018-05-29,5.0,Had an iced dirty chai from here a few weeks ago. Haven't stopped thinking about it since. Fantastic coffee. Nice non-dairy options too like oat milk. Can't wait to be back.
994,brooklyn-diamond-coffee-new-york,2017-12-12,5.0,Delicious latte and americano. They were quick and friendly. Lots of small bites for such a small place
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2019-12-05,5.0,"Amazing. Got a coffee (any size, any type) and a egg croissant for $4.36

Quality - good, price - outstanding. No wonder there was a line out the door."
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2019-11-05,4.0,"I used to think that their was only one Matto in the city at West 40th street and boy was I wrong.

Searching on Yelp turned up 13 more of them, and they are they selling franchises. Maybe with no money down or something because the way they are popping up.

Their store has a logo sign that looks just like the zero Tarot card , the FOOL card and I guess that was what I was but I wised up now. Matto is Crazy in Italian I guess that's what the owner was told when he came up with the $2 for everything idea.

They got your usual list of regular and espresso coffee. And have a decent number of muffins , cakes, cookies and other food items that are good for $2 and so is their coffee.  And $2 doesn't mean you get cheap and tasteless it is pretty good for the price and it is all fresh."
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2019-08-22,5.0,"Loved this place, way cheaper and offering the same products and quality standards as cafes nearby. 

I only tried The whole wheat croissant and it was great. I saw a diverse pastry offer and coffee is like $2 and tastes amazing. 

They do not accept credit card payments under $4, but since everything is cheap and looks great it is worth taking a pastry to go! 

There are no tables or chairs, and it is a bit crowded in the morning, but will definitely come back."
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2019-08-01,5.0,"I went back for the pistachio muffin later that night, right before they closed, like 3 minutes before closing and all the baked goods were gone. I asked the guy (same guy from 9 in the morning, guess he was working the whole day) if there were any more pistachio muffins left, luckily he said there was one left so I copped that. I also bought a raspberry herbal iced tea. 
I gave the pistachio muffin and raspberry drink to my parents and they really liked the pistachio muffin, i didn't get a chance to try it before it was gone. Luckily, I did get a chance to try the drink, it wasn't that good, not flavorful and it really tasted herbal, it wasn't my cup of tea, but it was just $2 so that was good."
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2019-02-14,5.0,"A colorful sandwich board stands proudly outside Matto Espresso. It declares ""Everything $2"". I'm intrigued, so I follow a group of patrons into the very tiny shop. Low and behold, it's true! The pastry case is stocked full of fresh croissant, muffins and various cakes and cookies. I opt to try the Spinach Lasagna. I also treat myself to a Latte (because $2). My grand total? $4.36! Both items were quite satisfying, especially given the price. Elsewhere in Midtown I could have dropped $9 easily for this breakfast. Be forewarned, this coffee shop is cozy (small). While the staff is welcoming and all smiles, this is not the spot to work remotely on a laptop during the day (head across the street to Pennylane Coffee for that). Matto is ideal though for a quick bite and coffee to go. Delighted that I was in an adventurous mood this morning, very nice to meet you Matto!"
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2019-10-02,1.0,"I normally won't put 1 star for a $2 everything store, because it's a great value for what you get.
Today I got my coffee sandwich and coffee capsules. I was charged $8 before tax. 
I asked why , they said it's $4 item the coffee capsules! There was no sign showing this price, and the store has a sign outside showing ""everything $2"" . So why you guys charging more. And if you do so why not putting a sign ?"
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2019-07-14,5.0,"Lattes for $2 and you had me sold. 

I could never find that at a Starbucks or DD. 
Go here if you want to invest in a proper espresso shot. 
They have any type of espresso drink, brewed coffee, a bariety of food, and moroccan mint tea (probably seasonal). 

I would recommend short pull as it's not bitter. 
The iced espresso melted fast so the bitterness increased at the same time. 

I'm excited to go back to try other drinks"
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2019-04-10,4.0,"Shout out to Matto Espresso, one of the only coffee shops open at 6:00 am near my hotel in Midtown East. I needed to get coffee early before leaving for LGA and Matto hit the spot. I just went with a regular coffee and added almond milk and cinnamon. It was really good and I loved the design on the coffee cup. Would visit again."
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2018-06-02,5.0,"Love this place!!! $2 for everything... I order here everyday! I get my mocha here now instead of StarBucks... Now i save a little bit of my moolah!!! Hoping for more locations please.... 

Quinoa salad and veggie burger were fantastic! I still have to try the rest. 

P.S. the drinks don't have ingredients or calorie information. 

beware starbucks!!!"
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2018-03-21,5.0,"This place still blows my mind.
We got the Italian hot chocolate, apple cake and babka- total bill $6.35.In Midtown those prices are unheard of or come with a caviat.
Everything tasted so great- 
The hot chocolate - was decadent and not too sweet 
The apple slice - with slivered almonds and apple slices was moist and slightly sticky- one of the better ones out there
The babka- our usual and pretty great.
The place was quite crowded on a snow day and I am sure it does well. If Matto continues with their great quality of food and beverage, I don't see why it won't be a threat to the $3-$5 per coffee establishments out there."
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2018-10-31,5.0,"People do not believe me when I say that everything is $2 here, BUT IT IS! I started coming here upon recommendation from a coworker, and now come here regularly. I love their cheesecake cups and carrot cake slices, but also their cheese burekas and the dolce de leche alfajores that I, unfortunately, haven't seen lately. When I was still drinking caffeine, this was a great place for an afternoon pick me up because there cappuccinos and lattes would also only be $2, which is obviously a fraction of the price of other places in the area. I would say that my only thing about this place is usually, I know if I want to come to Matto, I need to buffer some time because this place has grown to be incredibly popular with the UN Crowd and thus, often times, the line will be out the door. When this is the case, it's not the quickest trip, but they do a good job to keep things moving. There is not a lot of space inside, but they do well to get people in and out as quickly as possible, hence the 5 star review. I'll keep coming here because I think they have good quality, but man, they need to open another Matto in the area!"
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2017-12-13,5.0,"At the suggestion of a coworker, I tried this place for lunch. When she told me everything was $2, I was skeptical. I had little to no expectations and assumed the quality would be subpar because anything in NYC for $2 is sure to be terrible and/or a scam. Even McDonalds has pricey ""McDouble"" and ""Mchicken"" sandwiches that exceed $2 in many areas in the city. Much to my surprise, however, it was quite the opposite. For my first lunch, at Espresso Matto, I got a wrap, a side of pasta salad and black tea. Everything was delicious, and since the wrap, I ordered, was already made, there was hardly any wait time. The staff was friendly and patient, as I was undecided for the first few minutes of my arrival. I've since then visited a few more times for coffee and once, for a bagel. All three visits were doing lunch, and because of an efficient workflow, there is hardly ever a line. I wish other restaurants/coffee shops would take now. lol 

I recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or if you need a snack. You won't break the bank because everything is $2. lol"
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2017-11-08,4.0,"Hello, Matto! I was walking to work one day and saw this sign: ""Everything $2"" and I thought, ""WHAAAT, in New York?! Ridiculous."" So I went in to check it out, and oh my god, everything really IS $2. (Perfect for when there aren't any coffee carts out to get your favourite bagels or muffins.) Of course, that means that some items are less worth it than others, but that does not stop me from being a fan. The pastries are delicious, the coffee is decent (you get what you pay for), and the people working there are friendly! A fair warning though: you have to buy at least two things ($4) to be able to pay with card, but that's not really hard at all here--everything looks amazing. My friends and I have already returned here a couple of times, and you can bet we'll be back soon!"
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2017-11-19,5.0,"This place is awesome! I randomly stumbled in here on a Sunday morning and walked in to very warm and friendly employees. They proceeded to tell me that literally every item in the store was only two dollars! You heard me only two dollars! And they have such an extensive variety of sandwiches pastries muffins Etc. I ended up getting a Caramel latte, a organic black iced tea, a carrot cake and the mini green juice. I hope more people realize that this place is here since it's tucked away on 45th St. my bill for all of that was only eight bucks! Place is a definite must visit and absolutely necessary coffee shop for this neighborhood! This place is so much better than Penny Lane!"
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2018-10-10,5.0,Stopped by in the morning before work as I work down the block.  I bought the avocado egg sandwich on multigrain toast and a hot chai tea latte.  All I can say is so delicious and for the price you cannot beat it.  I would come here over Starbucks or Dunkin any-day!
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2017-11-17,4.0,"I wasn't planning on getting anything and was just walking through the area when I saw that everything was only $2. I went inside to check out the store and saw how nice and hip everything was. It's a great little spot to grab a coffee and something to eat for a low price-- found almost no place else in New York. The price on the bagel with lox was absolutely insane; never have I ever found a lox bagel that good at that low of a price. Overall, Matto is a hidden gem in the area. Definitely would recommend."
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2018-03-23,5.0,"I work by the new location near Union Square and it's amazing! I can't understand how they stay in business offering such good prices (EVERYTHING $2!!!) but I'm amazed! 

The coffee, cappuccino, etc. is delicious! As are the bakery items - choc chip muffin is my favorite!"
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2018-07-10,4.0,Love this place! Everything is $2! Such a great variety of pastries and omelet sandwiches...even a veggie burger. They have something for everyone! The coffee is way better then your average coffee cart. You will sometimes find a line out the door but at everything priced at $2 you can't go wrong!
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2018-07-27,5.0,"Stopped by after work for a pick me up and got a vanilla latte and a blueberry muffin! The muffin was delicious and so was the latte, especially for $4! $4 credit card minimum so it was perfect. Definitely coming here more often. I wish there were seating options!"
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2018-01-08,4.0,"a nice new coffee joint that in simple writing states each item is 2 bucks , not a penny more. not a penny less. hot and cold beverages , salads , wraps , cookies , muffins, pound cake, bagels , crossiants, etc. the pastries are well displayed as well as the other 2 dollar deals and if you are lucky to stop by during the morning rush you can count on getting fresh food that's not been gathering dust. i like to keep it simple by ordering 2 muffins , 2 cappys, 2 granola cups at a cost of 12.00 bucks which my coworkers will enjoy as well as my wallet . the location is on 2nd ave between 44th and 45th st. matteo espresso shops have been popping up all over the area and i can see it giving starbucks , dunkin and other chain coffee shops a run for its money , overall you can't beat  the prices and the slogan , you get what you pay for does not apply here , no you get a bit more."
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2017-12-29,1.0,Horrible customer service.. I had a terrible migraine and was a little slow to respond to their question whether my croissant should be toasted. They literally started laughing at me and discussing me behind my back. This is how you treat your customers? I like their coffee but I will never be back.
995,matto-espresso-new-york-2,2017-11-03,5.0,"I love this place, very nice personal, co-walker Anastasia very friendly and cute, really professional! Excellent coffee. I'm really happy be there everyday"
996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2019-06-16,4.0,"I came here for lunch out of the continence of their well-priced pre made sandwiches and nostalgia from my London trip. Their sandwiches are still just as good, fast service, clean air-conditioned dining space, and friendly staff. 

Their bathroom was out of service unfortunately. That's kind of a big deal in this area."
996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2019-05-05,2.0,"Staff was extremely nasty to customers. They made faces and rolled their eyes at customers when someone would ask a question. The coffee wasn't fresh and when they didn't have the type I wanted, I asked politely if they were brewing more, the girl looked at me and said ""did you look on the other side?"" (It wasn't on the other side) so I put my cup down and left."
996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2018-11-10,4.0,"Fresh food, healthy choices, cold or hot, a lot of variety, quality and robust flavors - what more do you need?  It's also very quick, since you simply grab and go.  Oh, and they keep the place extremely clean."

996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2019-05-14,5.0,"I've been coming to this location for a few weeks now and I have to say I really like it. Besides the very friendly and helpful staff they are one of the very few places that have tasty, healthier choices to choose from. Yogurt cups creations with fruits, nuts and honey and granola freshly prepared and ready to go. Sandwiches hot and cold, salads and fresh fruit. Also plenty to drink from coffee, water, freshly prepared juices and so on. Great for on the go or stay in and have a bite. Definitely recommend this place. Healthier choices."

996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2019-09-20,2.0,"This is a terribly run place.  I really like the frittatas they have for breakfast, but they are constantly out of them.   If I show up at 10 am, they say I am too late.  If I show up at 8 am, they say I am too early.  Nobody is helpful and I'm not sure anyone is in charge. Plus they don't manage the lines well, so the whole thing feels like a cattle car.  Hard pass from now on, I can get breakfast elsewhere."
996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2018-03-19,4.0,I am a fan of Pret but wanted to specifically shout out this location and staff members! My server was particularly helpful explaining the various matcha drinks that they have there and I loved the matcha almond milk latte! Love the grab and go assortments of foods. Perfect for busy new yorkers on the go!

996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2018-10-31,1.0,"I was getting an almond milk hot chocolate this morning at 8:45am. As I have a milk protein allergy, I told the cashier specifically it has to be almond milk and I heard him communicate it to the female, bespectacled barista. She made the drink and handled it to me. 

I took a sip and immediately identified that it was milk. I asked her three to four times to see if she made a mistake and she deliberately ignored me. Her colleague felt really bad for me and offered to make a new one for me. 

I am appalled at her service level and didn't even get an apology. There didn't seem like there was a manager on staff and hence I couldn't reflect my dissatisfaction on her rudeness. I hope management take allergies seriously."
996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2016-12-14,4.0,"This is my favorite Pret to meet in, especially when I need a space for meetings at 6:30 a.m. It's generally quiet during the early mornings, but gets insane real quick, closer to 7 a.m. Fortunately, most people take food to go instead of staying inside. 

I like the way the dark roast coffee tastes, even though a small cup will run over $2, which makes the coffee here just as expensive as Starbucks. I am a huge fan of the croissant, but it's midtown, so be prepared to pay quite a bit for a tiny portion. 

It is no secret that life's expensive here."
996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2017-01-06,5.0,"Stopped by here with 3 family members and boy was it crowded. I wouldn't expect anything less right by times square so i wont take away a star because i did enjoy my experience. The only issue was seating.

I started with the chicken noodle soup, the portion was small and just right! Then i had the southern bbq chipotle chicken of some sort, absolutely delicious and kind of zesty. Topped with off with some strawberry lemonade - refreshing.

Now i know its a place i can stop by to get good food considering they have so many locations."
996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2018-03-08,3.0,"Over priced, not that great. I actually eat here fairly often because there are so many. I got a sandwich, soup and soda for $17 and change today. Quality wise, I feel it's worth $12/$13. The staff is generally nice and they give you muffins and coffee on the house sometimes. Personally, I prefer Lenwich/Lenny's sandwich shop.

Edit: the brownie bite was amazing. I'll come back just to get coffee and the brownie."

996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2018-09-05,4.0,First time at a Pret and was pleasantly surprised at the inexpensive price for NYC and considering majority of the food is organic.  I got the chef salad and it wasn't bad.  My whole meal cost me $13 which was a salad and drink.

I can win wanting an iced coffee, which they were out of so I asked for a iced green tea which they were ALSO out of. At this point I wanted to leave. But, I bought a cold brew. BIG MISTAKE. The coffee tasted old and bitter. My soft baked cookie was crunchy. My friend bought a CHOCOLATE croissant and there was a barely HALF A TEASPOON of chocolate inside. I am a tourist in town and would NEVER come here again or recommend it to anyone in addition."

This is a chain with many locations in NYC as well in DC, Boston and Chicago. We thought it was very comfortable with a local vibe."
996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2017-03-30,4.0,"Stopped by looking for a fast casual meal. The food is good and healthy.

The staff was super friendly, and the grilled cheese sandwich variations were all amazing! We went to different Pret's throughout New York, and they always gave us a welcoming vibe. 10/10 would recommend for a quick breakfast/brunch spot!"
996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2018-08-01,3.0,This was a nice little a la carte restaurant located close to radio city and Rockefeller. You select your food from the fridges and order/pay at the counter. This places uses natural ingredients and the food is made throughout the day. Overall atmosphere is nice. I had the chicken parm wrap and the super berry wrap. I wanted an iced drink but they ran out of ice. Chicken parm was overwhelmed by the red peppers with minimal chicken inside. I was happy the chicken wasn't over cooked. The smoothie was great but I finished it after two sips. Price doesn't reflect food. It reflects location. It serves as a good fast option for local business people.

Always my go-to spot when I need to grab and run. It's not cheap by any means, but I feel like in this area even a deli turkey/cheese will run you in the vicinity of $10 so might as well have something that's actually good for you..."
996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2015-05-28,4.0,"I love these little places to pick up a green drink or a salad for lunch, they are amazing for that. I wouldn't however come here to dine in for lunch. Small space, Lots of tourists and a lot of pre packaged goods. 
You can order things made for you but it can get crowded and takes a little bit of time. 
The location is convenient to Rockefeller center and all of the larger companies in the area. You will find plenty of suits mixed with the tourists waiting on line. 
There is a small outdoor seating area diagonally across the street if you are looking to sit outside. 
We had a green juice, hard boiled egg with spinach , and a fruit cup. It came to be about 13 dollars, the cold pressed drinks are expensive ."

I had to wait like 5 mins I was alil upset because I didn't have time but I didn't complain and they gave it to me for free that was very nice of them.  
Love you guys."
996,pret-a-manger-new-york-21,2019-02-20,1.0,"Be ready to get attacked by the cashier. This morning got a sandwich as I usually do every few mornings from same location 6th ave and 47th street. After waiting in line finally came to my term . A lady named destiny Robinson attending the register would not even look at me and having a conversation with another employee . Finally I asked if she was open and without any response she grabbed the sandwich out of my hand and said $8.48 . I gave her $10.50 and she took the money and started another conversation with an employee without even putting the money in the register . After about 30 seconds I said excuse me mam can I have my change . Now she really got upset that I asked for my change while she was having a long conversation and just holding to the money. She screamed back , push the red button. I said what do you mean and she screamed so loud I said push down the red button . All the customers and staff froze and were looking at her screaming. I said I dont know what are you talking about , I paid cash and again she screamed back and pointed at a button on on the credit card machine few feet down on the counter which I immediately did. I asked her for her name and she screamed her name so loud that the manager ran and took over the situation and gave me my change and apologized and said she will have a talk with her. I believe pret is not doing a well job vetting their staff . I will never shop at pret any more since I was  insulted screamed at and  having a very bad day ."

Mr & I split the Tomato & Brie sandwich - tomatoes tasted kinda frozen & there was minimal brie but the bread was a nice soft French baguette & overall, while we've had better, it was a passable sandwich

The egg salad looked tempting as well but we were still pretty full from breakfast & really only wanted a lite snack + somewhere to rest for a few min before our Play - to avoid standing outside the theater too long

Free WiFi for customers - get a code on your receipt!

Free Restroom - get the code on your receipt.......unfortunately their restrooms were all kinds of NASTY

Dirty to the point I was a bit afraid to utilize the facilities but just kept telling myself not to think about it

Even though the doors had a keycode, there was such a huge line that people were just holding the doors open for everyone else.....but nice in theory that they were for customers only......just don't touch ANYTHING

So as an escape from the cold & a place to check some emails while nibbling on a sandwich, this place is A-OK"

Thank you so, so much for existing. Pret is a damn blessing. It's right across the street from my office and such a tasty lunch option. I know technically Pret a Manger is considered *fast food,* and while the checkout line certainly is quick, Pret is too fresh and well-made for such a category.

Let's put it this way: the spicy shrimp and cilantro wrap has sustained me every day for the past however-many-9-to-5-work-days and I'm not sorry at all.

If this Pret closed I think I'd cry."

But then I realized it actually tastes pretty damn good.  The shrimps were nice and fresh and light to the palate.  You don't feel bloated or crappy after eating the food here.  The strawberry lemonade was also pretty darn pricey.  $2.50 for a small bottle?  But again, it tastes good so I don't mind THAT much.  The egg salad sandwich was also nice.  I also can't complain about their coffee.

Bottom line, if you want a decent lunch on the go and don't want to feel like shit, this is a great option."

Their sandwich with the egg salad is the bomb.com. Tuna sandwich was good as well. The line for paying for your food was fast and efficient, this was however, where the downfall of my experience is. 

I was greeted monotonously by Rhome after he was asked to step in his register. I was curious as to
how they made their Chai Latte which I asked to Rhome, this required him to ask a barista. The next question I ask was what kind of milks they have available. I did not know that these basic, expected questions would be such a chore for him, I would've thought that Pret trains their retailers beforehand and gives them basic knowledge about the beverages they serve. 

Fortunately the other retailers, as well as the barista were more accomodating and asked me how I liked my drink.  

I'm so sorry retailers but jobs in the food industry especially ones that serve in manhattan are pretty much high stress low rewards kind of situation. If these simple questions irritate you then please consider switching to a job which does not require regular human interaction or simply ask a colleague to help you so that these questions wouldn't be such a burden on your daily work life, the more you know, the easier your days will probably be. 

TL;DR
Fresh food, fast line for the register. Asked the retailer 2 questions, (what kind of milks they have and how they make the drink), received rude attitude and just plain irritation from the retailer."

I was looking for the soup pots- couldn't find any.  Just when I thought I would have to get soup by ordering from the staff, I saw a wall wiith shelves of soup containers, large and small. I chose the Aztec Quinoa Chili.  The soups come in two sizes, 8 ounces and 12 ounces. I chose the 12 ounces since it was only $4.99, $1.00 more than the 8 ounces size.

The Aztec chilii was ""tender cannellini, pinto beans, quinoa, amranth and millet wih peppers, onions, corn, cilantro, ancho chile, lime juice."" The soup was spicy. It was also green, like there were tomatillos in there.

Once I went to the cash register I was asked if I wanted bread. I said yes.  I was given a warm whole wheat roll, at no extra charge."

I HATE their line system / lack thereof. It's always chaotic. When you know the system, choose the shortest line and end up getting taken care of faster than someone who doesn't know...it becomes a thing. Negative energy spewing out of them and directed right at you.

I've been called a line-cutter and have even been confronted by angry Pret-customers who don't understand the system. It's not my job to explain it to them. Post a sign, make a single queue, do something!

- The Spicy Pork U is still the best dish. Chewy thin dough, delicious shawarma-style Korean-seasoned pork, picked onions, and lines of spicy sauce. Like I wrote on the third day of opening, it could still use some cabbage or neutral vegetable to balance out the strong flavors and give the dish a stronger crunch.
- The eggplant versions loses some of the textural contrast, but gains in robust seasoned vegetable flavor. 
- Would endorse the Yuzu lemonade. However, the bangniets are only okay. The cream cheese filling was eccentric, both not properly centered in the pastry and out of place flavor-wise."

Bang Bar is worth every bang of the buck. I love David Chang's innovative concept of combining mediterranean food with a Korean twist. I'm not a big fan of shawarma because it can be a bit dry at times but I can tell you, David Chang definitely knows how to marinate his meats! And the bread is so fluffy. It's lighter than naan but thicker than roti without all the buttery residue.

Be prepared for a quick, delicious breakfast or lunch. Order your food & you can wait inside the small storefront before enjoying your meal at the standing tables outside in the hall. Standing tables only, by the way."

It is a small stall with limited seating outside which serves a fusion of Korean and middle eastern shawarma style wraps and bowls. The roti are thin and slightly chewy. I expected them to be thicker. I had the U bang in chicken and spicy pork but I was disappointed in the taste. The sauce was too salty and there were too many pickled onions. I prefer the flavor of the pork over the chicken, but it is spicy. The price isn't too bad considering the area. They do have a loyalty card but you have to ask for it.

997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-07-29,4.0,"3.5 stars!
Freshly griddled, chewy flatbread meets shawarma-style meats with sauces and garnishes! This singular concept defines Bang Bar, a casual stall located in the Shops at Columbus Circle (with only two standing tables right outside). For a very affordable price, I tried the ""mini"" bang, a set of two flatbreads, topped with spicy pork and chicken. The spicy pork was a bit on the fatty side and had a stronger flavor from the sauce, while the chicken was a bit leaner and had a more typical flavor from its soy/teriyaki-like sauce. Both were garnished with pickled onions and a creamy white sauce, and there were additional sauces that came on the side as well (ssam and spicy)! The highlight, however, remains the flatbread, which had a delightfully chewy, elastic texture. The meats I found rather overwhelmed in flavor by all the different sauces, but the bread still held up!"
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2020-01-17,4.0,"Tried this place on a Friday as soon as they were open for lunch. 
I had the The U with spicy pork and a ""bangniet"". The spicy pork was very true to jaeyook-bokkeum that you can get at a Korean restaurant. Very gochujang-based and tastes like street food with no hint of attempting to be healthy, as home-cooked jaeyook-bokkeum would be. The pickled onion was ok. But because the bread/wrap was already chewy and seasoned, the whole thing felt very salty and heavy. Therefore, the saam sauce on the side (which is disappointingly not at all close to ssamjang) was unnecessary. I was hankering for some fresh lettuce or frisee or something to balance out the salty, fatty pork. The bread/wrap itself is very good. It has a nice chewy texture and balanced flavor that makes it feel like a standalone rather than a vehicle for the innards. This was reflected in the bāngniets, which at $2.50 a pop seemed like an overpriced rice-flour ""donut"" I could get for 50 cents in Korea (or at Paris Baguette down the street for $1.50). However, the dough was so well crafted and a delight to chew. The sweet crunchy sugar coating and the cream cheese filling didnt feel overwhelming because of the bread. A bit of a splurge, but one that I would consider making again."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-04-12,2.0,"I've been wanting to try Bāng Bar by David Chang since they opened, but I usually find myself in the area only in the late afternoon when they've sold out and are closed.  I finally made a point to come for lunch right when they opened.  It's an interesting concept where Korean-style meats are cooked on a revolving spit like al pastor normally would be done.  They shave the meat off with a knife just like al pastor.

""The U"" is what they're known for.  They use a thin crepe-like wrap to wrap around the meat of your choice and it is folded in the middle into a ""U"" shape.  I went with a spicy pork one and a chicken one.  Each one comes with some cabbage, pickled onions, and some sauce.  They cost $5.79 each and one would be a large snack, with two being more than enough for a meal.

I felt like the wraps were missing something.  Both the spicy pork and the chicken seemed overly salty and pretty dry for me.  Since I got there right at opening, my meat came from a warming tray and was nice freshly sliced off the spit.  So maybe that explains the dryness.  But the wrap seemed flawed in design as well.  There was not nearly enough cabbage or pickled onions to balance out the salty richness of the dry meat.  If there was sauce in the wrap, it was minimal and added nothing to it.  It seems like these should have come with some sort of acidic/herby dipping sauce.  Give me a chimichurri, a pesto, or some sort of pickled carrot/daikon blend to dip the wraps in and the experience probably would have been better.  Heck, just give me a squeeze bottle of the Momofuku sauce they have at Fuku that's like gochujang.

I had a Vietnamese iced coffee as well which was decent.  It's a good thing I had that as the wraps were so dry and salty that I needed something refreshing to drink with it.

They only have a few communal standing tables outside.  Your best bet is to get the food to go and go down to Turnstyle Food Hall to eat."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-10-01,5.0,"Wow this is a real gem in Columbus Circle. Bang Bar serves up cheap street eats! They specialize in dough-filled wraps called the ""U."" You can choose between spicy pork, chicken or spicy eggplant as the main filling. I rotate between the spicy pork and chicken. The wraps are delicious and my favorite part is dousing it with their selection of hot sauces. They have a habanero based sauce that is my favorite because it's legitimately hot!

The service is fast here and while there is no seating - it won't take you long to gobble down your sandwich while leaning against their bar-high tables. The ""U"" wraps will only set you back about $6-$7. Overall this is a great value meal. Kudos to David Chang for bringing this spot to Columbus Circle."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-11-29,4.0,"Between the two of us we had some chicken, eggplant and pork.   Personally I liked the Pork most of all, nice crisp to it.    The chicken was #2 for me.   Eggplant lacked texture for me.   The bread is wonderful, everything delicious.  We also tried the hummus which was some of the best we've had.    Highly recommended although beware no real seating.  This is takeout or stand-up eat tables nearby.   

I take a star off for the lack of seating and the unfriendly order taker/cashier.   It was our first time and she had an attitude, unhelpful."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-02-04,5.0,"David Chang's newer fast casual food stall lives up to the hype. On the 3rd floor of the Time Warner Center, Bāng Bar stands alongside restaurants like Bluebird and Bouchon Bakery, and under the prestige of Masa, Per Se, and Landmarc.

But what makes Bāng Bar stand out besides the quickness and efficiency of the food is the price. With $6, you can enjoy the U, which resembles a Korean burrito, but the tortilla is much softer. It's kind of small, but still a decent snack.

I had both the spicy pork and the chicken Us, and the chickpea dip. The spicy pork was amazing. The chicken was also good, but didn't have as much flavor. It's the healthier option, and still tasted decent. But the spicy pork--I'd go back again just for that."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-02-08,5.0,"Had to try the new Momofuku Bāng Bar for breakfast. We got there early at 8am to avoid any lines, and thankfully we did. We ordered the mortadella and cheese wrap, the Zabar's smoked salmon, and the cinnamon bun. The smoked salmon was very good, filled with cream cheese and capers. The mortadella wrap was also good, juicy, greasy with cheese and mustard on it. The cinnamon bun is certainly very unique, it tastes really good, and lighter than a normal cinnamon bun. Overall good experience and I will be returning to Bāng Bar to try the lunch wraps as well.

Went back for lunch and tried the chicken and pork wrap. The general manager Riccardo was kind enough to also let us try their new breakfast special. Everything was delicious, in particular the pork."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-01-11,4.0,"I've tried all 4 things on the lunch menu... 

1. Spicy pork U bang - absolutely delicious and super flavorful. If you leave it for a while the sauce will get absorbed into the bang (which is thin). At $6, I thought it was fairly priced for amount of food you get. Definitely better than the chicken but much more unhealthy (super oily). Eat it hot!

2. Chicken bang - nothing special but at least it's healthier 

3. Spicy eggplant rip and dip - first the bang it comes with is thicker and fluffy and piping hot. Like a naan. Eggplant wasn't spicy at all, is served cold, and I actually liked it better without the bread. 

4. Chickpea rip and dip - definitely better than the eggplant but less quantity. It's like a lemony light hummus and served with sesame oil and seeds. Delicious! Maybe my favorite thing on the menu 

I also got to try samples of their porridge (one with kimchi one with mushroom ragu) and honestly this would've been my favorite item. Much cleaner tasting than the oily bangs."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2018-12-03,3.0,"Bang Bar is David Chang's latest concept, a tiny box of a gourmet gyro shop tucked into a corner in sleek Time Warner Center.

I checked it out the week of the opening, and despite reports of long lines, there wasn't too much action at 11:30. They have a few people tending to the line, which is split up into several roped off-sections. Once at the hostess stand, you'll be given a long spiel that includes her telling you her name, and welcoming you... I appreciate the attempt to inject some warmth into a fast food concept, but it came off weirdly. You order and pay with her (cardless, naturally).

This hospitality continues over somewhat more successfully as you wait next to the open-kitchen, where shaved spits of meat were appealingly dripping with fat. The chef asked me if I had any dietary restrictions and if I wanted spicy or sweet; after picking spicy, I was handed a small, warm cup of congee with a kimchi-like topping. I appreciate the free snack, and it was excellent-- bright, savory--but I wasn't ever told what it was.

I was given my food shortly after and was on my way. There's no seating, just a few standing tables, and despite the short line they were already filled. More tables, please! I took it outside to Central Park, but this solution won't work in this colder weather.

I went for the spicy pork in the u-shaped wrap ($6ish). Though not overly spicy, it was very flavorful, especially with some sweet pickled red onion; the pork was on the pleasantly fatty side. The bread was good but nothing special. It wasn't super craving-worthy for me.

The menu is slim, with just two options for their play on a wrap and two dips. Prices are low for the area, but at a premium to cart food. Overall, I found it to be quite the production over relatively simple food (and isn't that the perennial Momofuku complaint?). I'll give them a second chance for breakfast."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-03-18,5.0,"I love this place so much. Since our first visit, we've come for breakfast (the mortadella + cheese is so weirdly good) and again for lunch.

First time I came here, I got the Pork U, very delicious but spicy. Now I religiously get the Chicken U (I don't even like chicken but they put a ton of flavor in it to mask the normal taste of chicken LOL). Also, everything on the menu is less than $10, cant beat that! 

Very small area for seating (with no seats), so I usually take mine to go. Hoping to try breakfast soon!"
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2018-12-09,3.0,"I came during lunch around 2pm and there wasn't a line there. I ordered the spicy pork over rice. I was also able to try their kimchi for free. 

Pros: the flavor of the spicy pork was really good and actually spicy. I liked that it was spicy enough to have my nose run a little but not enough where I needed water and couldn't enjoy it. 
The staff there were very friendly and interacted with the customers. While waiting for my order, they offered a free tasting of their traditional rice pudding (I think) with kimchi. The dish itself was not good at all but as the two employees were offering it, they were being playful when suggesting it which maybe me feel welcomed.

Cons: the ratio of rice to pork was too high. The rice itself did not have any flavor so I tried to conserve the pork and sauce to put it over the rice. 
The rice pudding with kimchi had a very subtle flavor, so subtle that I didn't taste anything. 

Overall: the pork was very tasty and due to its limited menu, there I don't think I'll make my way back here however I would try the pork dish if you happen to stop by."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2018-10-31,5.0,"David Chang's newest spot just opened at Columbus Circle, the quick service bread bar open for breakfast and lunch.

Soon to be joined by a new location of Noodle Bar, this is something fun and different, using great bread similar to the one he's been serving at the original noodle bar location downtown.

For breakfast, from 8-11, definitely try the Kkwabaegi ($3.79), a delicious sweet cinnamon twist doughnut, which is actually made with the same dough as all of the other breads here. There are also three other options classified as ""Mini"" - I skipped the veggie one but I did try the Mortadella & Cheese ($4) and the Zabar's Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese ($9), which were both excellent.

For lunch, from 11 until they sell out, you can get a hearty ""The U"", which is more of that great Bāng Bread, this time in a larger portion and folded around either Spicy Pork or Chicken ($5.79) into a big U shape. The pork definitely has some nice kick to it and makes for a satisfying grab and go meal at a definite steal of a price. You can also get some of that warm bread on it own with some spicy eggplant or chickpea dip ($2.99).

I will be back any time new items are introduced, as everything was delicious. It also makes for a nice snack while you wait on what will inevitably be a line at the Noodle Bar opening soon right next door."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2018-11-08,5.0,"Love love loved this place. Definitely a place to go to and eat.  David Chang does it again, innovative, creative, and flavorful food that was a seriously much needed addition to the upper west side neighborhood. He's there a lot so definitely go now to get a glimpse of him and say hi. He will feed you foodand samples. Can't wait for noodle bar to open but this one place is definitely somewhere I will go more than just once a week. 

Hypes: 
- menu - it's small, limited, easy to understand, and everything on it is delicious so you can't make a wrong choice. There is a breakfast menu from 8-11 and a lunch menu which is from 11-when they run out.  
- I am in Love  with the spicy pork U and the chickpea dip. You must get both of these!! 
- drink variety - from coffee and green tea to sparkling waters and authentic drinks 
- hot sauce - these along with the pickled onions are awesome. I loved the red sauce 
- rip and dips- this is amazing. It's a fresh naan-like chewy fresh dough that's cooked and made there served with dips. I am obsessed with the chickpea dip. It Is mindblowing. 
- the kkwabaegi - at first it was ok. A little more sought and less sweet but it grew on me. Mild, caramelly, cinnnamony, and pretty good 

Gripes: 
- lines. They get long. Come before 11. If you're there after 1 they most likely run out of their U sandwich 
- no seating. It's two tables where you can stand and eat. I'd honestly enjoy my food more if I could sit."

Around the area, all restaurant are pretty expensive.
If we feel to eat We had only 2 choices  to high end bakery or  Whole Foods before. They were okay for quick note though but here is more like restaurant quality grab&go spot under $10.

997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2018-11-02,5.0,"Oh my! Walking on my way to class, I remembered that Bang Bar was at Columbus Circle, 3rd floor. I wish the signage was a little better on floor 3 to show which direction Bang Bar is, but you'll find it eventually after walking around lol. 

I come to say that while I'm sad that they're sold out on Day 3 after opening, their customer service was great! There was a gentleman who apologized for being sold out as soon as I stepped in and offered a sample of their spicy pork. 

Their spicy pork is delicious!! If you don't like or stand spicy food, it is on the mild side.

Since it just opened, I recommend going there early if you can since it's super popular right now(check David Chang's insta)."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-04-27,5.0,"This place never disappoints. I work nearby, so I've come several times to pick up lunch to go for me and coworkers.

Whether you get the bang or bowl versions, you'll get a decent sized portion for a reasonable price. I love the mix of fillings - pickled onions, shredded lettuce, choice of meat/filling, and sauces. They pack up the food very neatly and are generous with sauces; last time I asked for more, and they were very nice about it.

The lines can get long around lunch time, but they are very efficient. There's usually someone handing out menus and offering to answer questions while in line, so there is less of a delay when ordering. They take credit card and Apple Pay, which was great the last time I forgot to bring my card! Yikes."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-03-22,5.0,"I love coming to Bang Bar. The food is incredible, service is super friendly, and the prices are ridiculously good.

Food is indescribable except that it's incredibly flavorful. I've had pretty much everything on the menu, my favorite being the two mini bangs for the price of one. The chicken is okay, but I think the spicy pork reigns supreme in terms of flavor. Sometimes I'm a little surprised that the chicken tends to sell out first, although I guess if you don't like spicy, the chicken is your only option. But I'm kinda saying it's good, but not AS GOOD as the pork. Absolutely love the eggplant bang. I like it better in the form of the bang wrap instead of the dip itself. The cinna bang is a great little dessert, only sometimes available during lunch. And everything is perfectly filling. If you're around the area or shopping at Columbus Circle, it's a perfect little bite if you're hungry and don't want to spend a fortune or else battle it out in the Whole Foods downstairs.

As for the chickpea dip...I could eat a vat of it. It's incredibly smooth, almost kinda smokey...maybe some sesame oil in there. It's addicting and perfect with the bang to dip in it. Please do yourself a favor and get this.

The menu only slightly evolves that I've seen since their opening. It's a great idea to follow them on instagram so see any daily specials (which they tend to have every so often), new menu items/creations, and if they're close to or are already sold out.

I can't get over the value here. Everything is under ten dollars. Not only that, there's a loyalty system card where if you buy ten items, you get an eleventh free.

Finally, the staff are incredible. They are so incredibly pleasant, lively and helpful. They make sure everyone has gotten little samples. If you're waiting and it's not too crazy busy, they give out samples of either mushroom jook or kimchi jook (Korean rice porridge). I think the sole purpose of having the jook is to just give samples which keeps everyone happy!"
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-12-29,3.0,"Wife wanted to try this place so we order the office bowl and the U.   The U was interesting, taste was not bad but fell apart towards the end.  Wife ordered the office bowl, spicy pork.  Bowl itself was ok, nothing special but too many burnt pieces.  Overall I thought the concept was interesting but execution of the actual food needs work.  However I will say the staff is very friendly.  Should have went the the underground for food though."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-03-22,5.0,"Although I universally enjoy David Chang's food, his affordable options are my favorite by far. Bāng Bar and Peach Mart are both absolutely incredible. 

This was my second time at Bāng Bar; my first time was soon after it opened and gosh the line was long even on a weekday. My friend and I shared the chicken U, the spicy pork U, the eggplant dip, and the two choya sodas. Everything was 5 stars perfection, and the prices are insaaaanely good. $5 for the chicken U, which is a totally complete meal? Unheard of in midtown Manhattan. I was really surprised that the chicken was actually better than the spicy pork; the spicy pork was a little too spicy for me, and the chicken was incredibly flavorful and juicy. That day, they were also sampling a buckwheat tea that was absolutely amazing. I would definitely pay for that. 

I was eager to return, and we came back today at 10:25, just in time to catch the last of the breakfast menu. We shared the mortadella sandwich ($4, insanity again), which was wondrous with the combination of mustard (which I normally don't like), cheese and sautéed mortadella. It's not elegant or high-end, but it is plain satisfying and comforting. We waited 30 min for the lunch service to start and decided to get one of the specials - the Kevin XL ($12) with spicy pork, chicken, spicy eggplant, and Green Goddess dressing. How could we say no to everything we wanted? I was surprised that it was in a rice bowl form, but it was the perfect medium to sop up the juices and overabundance of meat practically spilling out of the bowl. The Green Goddess dressing was totally addicting, and everything was even better than the last time we had it. The spicy pork was less spicy and more smoky; this time, I felt that it was just as good as the chicken. 

Today, they were sampling a congee with a mushroom ragout that was also incredible. I would also pay for that. Unfortunately, they said that they are currently not selling the tea - please bring it back! 

Although there was a slight blip in service because my order somehow didn't go through and I waited for 15 min watching everyone after me get food (since I was second in line), the servers and cashier were very pleasant and apologetic. They made my bowl immediately and I quickly forgot about my wait because it was so darn good. 

Can't wait to come back and see what they try out next!"
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2020-03-16,3.0,"Got the spice Pork U. The meat, pickled red onion and sauce was amazing. However really disappointed in the small serving. When I was watching them make it they only put a small scoop on each end of the wrap. I understand it's not going to be burrito size but it could have been more. Although the flavors are amazing  and def worth a first try I probably won't  be back."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2020-03-01,5.0,Yum!!! I had the mini chicken u wrap and one of their little cinnamon sugar donuts ! Such great flavor for the chicken
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-09-18,2.0,"What the hell happened to this place?

Don't be fooled by the months-old publicity photos showing layers of pork carved to order off the trompo. What you're going to get are pre-cooked, unevenly cooked thick slices of pork and chicken that have been sitting in heating trays for hours or more, oversauced and unlovingly stuffed into tin foil in the messiest, most uncaring way possible.

The staff here either haven't been trained how to use the trompo (the key attraction for the food here!) or don't care. The layers are too thick, stacked unevenly (so the meat burns rather than self-marinating), and not sliced to order. I suspect they batch pre-cook everything to save time.

The result is a pretty lame, asian-ish ""taco"", the sort of thing you can get at dozens of places. Nothing special.

An amazing concept, but the lack of care gas ruined the place. I won't be back."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-01-22,5.0,"This might be the best $6 you'll spend on food anywhere near Columbus Circle. Come to think of it, it might be the only thing that costs $6 in this ritzy urban mall. Either way, you're in for a treat at Bang Bar.

They specialize in these dough-filled creations called a ""U."" Your choice of a few different fillings is stuffed into the ends of a long, rectangular flattened dough is rolled up and formed into a U shape. It's about as thin as a crepe. From there you eat your way down both sides of the letter-shaped wrap until you get to the center where it's pretty much just dough. I got the spicy pork option, which is essentially al pastor, and it was awesome. Depending on your level of hunger it might border on a snack more than a full meal, but for me it did the trick for a quick lunch.

They serve breakfast and lunch only, so don't try and pop in for dinner. That could change at some point, but for now you'll have to swing by early if you want to try the latest gimmick from the David Chang empire."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-10-01,3.0,"I got a chicken U and spicy pork U. I liked the wrappers a lot, but I wasn't a fan of the meat. The chicken tasted like it just had a ton of soy sauce, as it was suuuper salty. I'm talkin maybe over-1500mg-sodium-in-one-U levels of saltiness. The spicy pork was better as it got some flavor from the fattiness of the pork, but it was too spicy for me. Even if it was less spicy, it was still saltier than I like. I couldn't finish either due to the saltiness.

Each U was actually quite big. I actually think one might be enough for lunch if you ate breakfast/are not super hungry (I'm a short woman so take that into consideration) -- def agree with another reviewer that two is prob too much for lunch for most people -- maybe get 2 and eat 1.5? It's a nice portion size for the low price, but I wish the meats were seasoned differently. I also didn't like the raw onions they put in both of them. If you dislike raw onions, ask to get it without maybe."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-03-04,5.0,Randomly remembered this existed when I was shopping at TimeWarner. I was there on a Sunday in the afternoon (around 1PM)  and they hadn't sold out of anything but definitely looked close to the end. The wait wasn't too long but there was little room to stand and eat there. Meat is super flavorful and the texture of the bread is nice and soft. Also tried the cinnamon sugar for dessert and I wish it was bigger because I wanted more. You also get a frequent buyer card which I am jazzed about.
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-01-18,5.0,"Decided to check this place out for lunch after hearing so many great things about it. I arrived around 12:10pm on a Tuesday and there were only about 4 people in the line ahead of me.

After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the special: two mini bangs--one with chicken and one with spicy pork, a rip and dip with eggplant, and a kkwabaegi. 

After ordering, they were super engaging with all the customers--offering samples of their kimchi--which was great, and conducting a random poll about how many holes a straw has--which was fun. The staff was really some of the most friendly people I have ever been around at a fast-casual type restaurant.

As I was leaving, they also gave me a frequent flyer stamp card and gave me 3 stamps towards a free lunch after 9 stamps and a card for a free coffee next time I'm there--really pouring on the gifts which was a nice touch.

The food itself was also excellent. Both the chicken and spicy pork were great, though the spicy pork had more flavor development IMO. The rip and dip was great, as was the kkwabaegi and everything was super reasonably priced (actually probably a bit under-priced) for the amount of food that I received.

Overall, this is not the lightest lunch you'll ever have, but it is definitely a spot that you have to check out if you're in the area."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-09-06,4.0,"The wraps here are awesome - the chicken is definitely the best, though the spicy pork is also great. The most wonderful part is the bread, of course. Definitely want to try some of the breakfast items here at some point, too."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-04-13,4.0,"Really enjoyed my chicken wrap but the only thing is there were too much onions - really, so much.... way too much. Like every bite was onion...ous. Other than that, it was really tasty."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-03-30,5.0,"Still great food! Decided to come ~1 PM on a Saturday expecting a crowd, but was pleasantly surprised by a short, fast line. I decided to try the mini bangs this time- one chicken, one pork. Loved both, make sure to ask for sauces!! Both meats were juicy, saucy and not too salty. 

I also had the special, marinated shishito peppers which were saucy, garlicky deliciousness. Def will be back again, hopefully to try their breakfast."
997,bāng-bar-new-york-3,2019-06-26,5.0,"Bāng Bar is the best!! The Spicy Pork U is the best thing I've ever eaten, and it was only $6. Amazing. The office bowl is also well-priced at $8, and is a filling meal. The simple ingredients go perfectly together -- whoever came up with these options is a culinary genius. This place is by far the best tasting, most bang-for-your-buck eatery in the Time Warner Center. Bāng Bar is perfect if you're looking for quick takeout with good service. Absolutely love that they have a punchcard; I'm well on my way to that free 9th Bāng!"

998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2020-01-14,3.0,"This location is a tiny spot in the atrium of the office building they're located in. You can fit two maybe three people inside at a time and typically they only have one or two people working. 

I started coming here only for their golden lattes since 1) they're yummy and 2) turmeric really does help with various physical ailments. A large is the size of a small anywhere else and costs $5. They're pricey for such a small amount and that does bother me, however, they're also the closest spot to my office that offers a golden latte. If there were cheaper options in the area, I would probably forget all about Bluestone Lane.

Regardless they get the job done if you're in a pinch."
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2019-11-25,3.0,"Location: don't get lost. It's downstairs of building 805. Walk through the revolving door, find the escalators on your left and go down the stairs. It will be immediately to your right once you get off the escalator.  

Drinks: I ordered a matcha latte with oat milk.  Hubs ordered a flat white.  This is not a traditional coffee shop.  I knew that the minute they asked hubs 'small or large' for the flat white. Flat whites and cappuccinos are supposed to be 6 ounces if we're talking traditional coffee practices.  

Coffee lacks any complexity to its flavor.  Hubs was not a fan of the flat white.  The milk was steamed to the right temperature but the flavor of the beans was mediocre at best.

The matcha, though, is spot-on.  There's a strong matcha flavor in the latte and it isn't bitter like other places I've tried.  I would definitely go with the small matcha latte with oat milk again here."
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2020-01-10,4.0,I wanted to update my review since it was a. Not old.  Bluestone Lane continues to be one of my favorite coffee shops.  This location is super convenient to my office and has a very friendly staff.  They are on Level Up so the more you come the more you can save.  Cashed in a $5 credit today.  I got my usual large iced red eye black with an almond croissant.  This is my go to here as they are always excellent.  The pastries change often which is a good thing.  They also have delicious avocado toast.  Located in the atrium of 805 Third down the escalator well worth a visit.
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2020-03-04,3.0,I have mixed reviews. I ordered a cold brew and avocado toast. The cole brew was great however the avocado toast was left to be desired. The mashed avocado was brown instead of green which made it unappetizing to look at.
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2019-09-04,5.0,"Went here the day after July 4th and it wasn't even open yet - I didn't realize but the guy working there still made me an awesome latte and was super friendly and helpful!

Definitely recommend this place!

It isn't a sit in shop though keep that in mind. Just come by to get your drink to go :)"
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2019-01-07,4.0,"I stopped by Bluestone Lane to grab some caffeine. Located inside an office building, Bluestone Lane is among other little shops and restaurants with a spacious lobby. 

The coffee shop itself is a tiny room with barely any standing space to wait in line, order, and/or wait to pick up your drink. I just ordered a regular latte but it took a while since three ladies in front of me ordered 2-3 items each. 

The latte itself was smooth. Small, but just enough caffeine to get me through the afternoon."
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2019-05-13,2.0,"I was less than impressed.  The food wasn't bad, by any means, but I don't feel like it was any better than any fast food restaurant.  I had the banana toast, and it took what seemed like forever to prepare that simple dish.

The restaurant really isn't a restaurant at all.  It's more of a counter, and you have to go around the corner to a commons area to find a place to set.

Service was---rushed is the best way I can describe it.  I got the distinct feeling that the main goal was to run as many people through as fast as they could.

I think I'll pass our next trip there."
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2018-07-27,5.0,"Ok, had to add to my previous review. I just ordered the best Iced Latte ever. Not knowing what the Aussie Iced Latte comprised of, I ordered it and asked for cream/half and half if possible. Then the barista tells me that there's a scoop of ice cream in this latte. So not having any sustenance yet, I was like ok, sure, that works. 

Then upon getting my drink, there it is, a beautifully crafted iced latte with a scoop of vanilla ice cream floating so pretty at the top! I wanted to grab a photo then and there but the counter is small and there was a long line of folks waiting for their orders. Man, it got crowded in seconds. This was 8:25am on a summer Friday. Cue the Australian hottie barista behind the coffee machine. Wink wink.

Love this latte but I can't drink this daily... Don't know how many calories I'm consuming now. Don't care, it's so good."
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2019-11-25,3.0,"Meh.  Got a flat white.  The coffee is a little bland tbh; completely forgettable.  Milk was steamed okay and the temperature was right.

Ironically, the wife's matcha latte was pretty freakin awesome.  No bitterness and tons of flavor.

I couldn't decide on whether I should give 4 stars because the matcha, but I feel like 4 stars is too generous in this case."

There's a shop that sells food across the hall and an atrium where you can sit an eat. Not sure if any of it has Wifi."
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2018-08-27,5.0,"Great chain of Australian coffee shops! This one is conveniently located to me but it is tricky to find in the basement level - first time I went here on a weekend I couldn't find it because the office building looked closed haha. Too used to ground level locations like the one on Madison and near Bryant Park! 

What I've gotten: avocado toast, almond butter toast, tumeric latte, affogato, dirty chai

I have tried a few things and now always gravitate towards the iced dirty chai! Hint of cinnamon and kick from the espresso is fantastic. Toasts are thick cuts of bread with generous toppings packaged in cute boxes. Would recommend for a quick breakfast or snack! 

Download the app (level up platform) for their rewards program $5 for every $50, and $5 for first installation of the app. They also have a referral program, give $5, get $5! Have to connect a debit/credit card though and don't think the app has functionality to accrue points if you pay with external card."

Either because no other place made me want to spend that kind of money on a piece of toast with avocado or because it's just toast with avocado! After seeing it on the menu at Bluestone Lane, I thought what the hell, I'll give it a try!

I got my overly priced avocado toast on a gluten free bun with a poached egg on top. There was a generous amount of avocado and the bread was crispy although not warm enough. It tasted as I thought it would taste. Imagine this: toast, avocado, egg. I ordered it without the chilly flakes.. maybe that was my mistake? Either way, it's pretty tasty but I probably wouldn't get it again mostly because of the price.

The staff was nice and the food was rather quick. The americano was very good as well! I'd recommend this place for those looking for a quick meal."

I arrived in the morning and ordered an espresso and avocado toast.  It took 25 minutes.  There was only one other customer.  There was one to both take orders and prepare food and he seemed quite overwhelmed.  My toast was too thick, almost inedible.  The avocado was not that ripe and also lacking in sufficient salt to make it tasty, and there wasn't enough of the avocado to justify the price.  All in all, it was a huge disappointment."

Food- I've seen a lot of pictures with the smoked salmon on top of the avocado toast, but when I got there the add-on option was $6. I decided to get it because I eat what I love but it was a tiny piece. I ended up getting the ratatouille baked eggs which was decent but I feel like I can get it anywhere else for a cheaper price ($13). The menu also didn't have a lot of options.

Service- The servers barely paid attention to me and this is the cafe sit in location. It was a hot summer day & the A/C was barely blowing. I followed yelp instructions and downloaded the app to get $5 off and they said ""we don't let you use it here at this location"".

If you're not from the area finding the place is a little like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Luckily, my husband came across a previous review which revealed that we had to go into an office building in order to get into the restaurant. And I use the term restaurant loosely, because it is literally a hole in the wall cafe type place with no seating. They have tables and chairs around the corner, in a sterile, office atrium. The service by the staff was short and sweet, without much conversation. I felt like we were being rushed through even though we were the only ones in line. I saw the picture of the avocado toast on the menu, and pretty much knew that's what I wanted, but I was open to other options. They do not have too many other offerings besides oatmeal and a couple of other different varieties of toast. The menu is actually very limited. Good for a quick stop, but not exactly the experience we were hoping for. The Yelp page has the owner of the place describing it much differently than what it actually is. A bit of a bait and switch if you ask me. Anyway, I feel like the place was pretty average."
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2018-01-07,4.0,"Took me a ridiculous time to find this hole-in-the-wall; combined with my perpetual state of hanger and the freezing cold, I think I scared the person behind the counter by ordering an insane amount of food. Having gone to the Bluestone Lane on the UES, I've long resigned myself to the fact that the food is heavily overpriced for what it is but ... their toasts are so dang tasty. 

If you're like me and generally can't stomach nursing a cup of coffee but need an energy boost, try the Piccolo, which does the trick when you can't grab 8+ hours of sleep. It's one shot of espresso with some steamed milk that the barista recommended me one bleary-eyed morning. Did the trick, went down relatively smoothly, and the sweet milkiness on top cuts down on the bitterness of the espresso. I've also tried the Hot Milo, which tastes like a better version of my usual Mocha order. 

I used to always order the avocado toast (even though all you really need to find is their Balthazar multigrain) but they released two new toasts that have completely blown my mind: the tumeric sweet potato toast (which comes with this beautiful tumeric hummus) and the smashed pea/coconut yogurt toast. I'll be on the frontline of saying smashed peas can never rival a good avocado smash but Bluestone's version with mint and chili flakes is awfully tasty. 

This is definitely a pick up and go spot but, on a beautiful day, there are worse ways of killing time than picking up a toast and eating it at one of the tables in the center of the Atrium."
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2017-02-10,2.0,"Really, really unimpressed. There was a Bluestone Lane next to my office and my coworkers loved it so I decided to try this one out. First of all, unlike the one near my office, this one has zero seating and is truly just a counter in the basement of an office building (The Atrium - take the escalators down when you enter).

I ordered a large matcha latte with skim and the Brekkie bowl (granola over yogurt with blueberries). One thing I noticed is that the posted menus (one in chalk, one behind a frame) and the menu online all had discrepancies which made ordering confusing. The Matcha latte came to $5 plus a $0.50 add on (what did I add on??) and was tiny tiny tiny - think the size of a Starbucks tall. I personally think that matcha tastes like pond water so I'm not sure why I tortured myself by ordering it. The Brekkie bowl looked like a fruit parfait that I could have bought from the grocery store and didn't taste much better. 

Giving it two stars instead of one because the guy working was nice and was pretty good eye candy on my way to work. I sat in the cafe next door to eat and found myself wishing I had just gotten food there."

998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2019-07-26,4.0,Good food..staff is very friendly..no sitting..to go only..located inside in the lower level of office building...
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2019-08-11,3.0,"I want to love this place but feel like they're a bit overpriced for what you get, especially with how much extra they charge for GF bread ($2 even for a half portion!!). And is the avocado smash toast supposed to come toasted? Mine came on dry, untoasted bread :("
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2018-01-28,5.0,"So cute and so yummy!

I stayed over in midtown and opted to try this over my hotel breakfast bar. What an excellent choice.

Although a little hard to find for someone not familiar with the building, the security guard directed us down the escalator with a smile. It's a tiny little storefront right at the bottom. We went on a Friday morning at about 8:30 and there wasn't a line or wait. Note that the seating is in the atrium around the corner.

I got a plain coffee and oatmeal and my coworker got a green tea and avocado toast. The oatmeal was AMAZING! And just the right portion to keep me full until lunch, while not making me feel sluggish after eating it. The combo of coconut and cashews and warm cashew milk (or some form of nut milk...I'm blanking on it now!) was so good.

I would definitely make this a more regular spot if I lived in town."
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2019-07-22,5.0,Thank you for delicious breakfast! Guys were very nice and friendly! We get avocado toast and coffees
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2017-11-26,3.0,"Location: in the basement of the food court area in between 3 rd and 50 th. Nice decor but not build in seating. You can take the food and seat at the shared food court area through.
Food: the reason I gave a 3 star was really due to the food - I ordered avocado toast with added salmon. First of all I had to wait for about 30 mind on a work day morning for it, with only 2 orders before me. Secondly the toast came really dry - almost burned and is cold. The avocado and smoked salmon was really nice through.
Coffee: got latte with soy milk. Nothing to complain, great quality and came out really fast.
Pricing- the total came out to almost 20 dollars for the toast plus the coffee. Slightly on the pricey side."
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2017-10-18,5.0,Had the lamington and tea- so good! Love how airy and light the dessert is- it's very unique. Not cloying and a nice treat. Glad my friend told me to check it out- even if you're not a big coffee fan I would still recommend this place just for that dessert.
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2019-02-19,4.0,"It's located down the escalators of an office building, could be like their food court. Small booth like location. But staff was friendly and helpful. I was in and out in need for a caffeine fix. Coffee was fresh. It didn't taste bitter nor burnt (like it been out for so long)."
998,bluestone-lane-new-york-10,2016-10-27,5.0,"I can see why this place has the highest ranked reviews amongst all others in the same building! Their latte was superb, hitting the perfect right notes on everything! I was tempted to order another one right after I had finished mine, but I am trying to ease up on my caffeine intake for now, until I get to Europe, just to see if I still can. 
The place itself is tiny and doesn't have any bagels, but they kindly direct you to silo's opposite blue lane for that. 
Very friendly folk and excellent coffee! I could not be happier!"
999,java-girl-new-york,2020-05-27,4.0,"Good coffee. Recommend coming here, but chairs outside during the pandemic encourages patrons to hang around (without masks on because they are drinking coffee). It makes it difficult to walk past without getting within six feet. Please remove."
999,java-girl-new-york,2020-01-11,5.0,"absolutely delicious :) a classic coffee spot that screams of ""real new york"". quaint and adorably decorated, Java Girl is clearly a labor of love!"
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-12-02,4.0,"Went to try a iced latte and pastry and I was neither disappointed nor satisfied with what I got. The iced latte was just okay and did taste a little burnt. Of course it gave me a boost of energy, as it should, but I didn't really enjoy drinking it. I got a pear turnover and that was reaaaally good. I've never had a pear pastry that I genuinely enjoyed but this was light, fluffy , sweet and tasted fresh. Definitely recommend!"
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-10-16,3.0,"Very nice place. So romantic and cozy. They do have the best pastries. So yummy and delicious. I like coming by early in the morning and grab a nice cup of coffee with an  apple turnover. Incredibly delicious.
My only complaint: this group of men sitting in front of the coffee shop smoking. I wanted to use the chair they have outside but was unable to sit and enjoy my coffee because of all the cigarette smoke that blew in my face. 

Not the best place to sit and relax outside especially with children for that reason."
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-09-18,5.0,"Came here to meet up with a friend who had a doctor's appointment around the corner. While I waited for her to arrive, I was able to chat with Linda, (who I assume is the owner) who also greeted me once I entered and offered help as I marveled at all the beans. We talked about all of her flavored bean options. Five minutes later I'm buying 3 bags of coffee! Which, even after adding an iced coffee to the bill, I thought was very inexpensive. Linda was absolutely lovely as was the barista behind the counter and very informative. I got a coconut almond iced coffee that was DELICIOUS. I live nowhere near here but I will absolutely be back when I'm in the area, which is every week. Can't wait!"
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-07-06,5.0,"A lovely local coffee shop in Upper East. I used to go to a local place in Hell's Kitchen . Since I moved to the east side, it has been a struggle to find a reliable coffee shop. Java Girl is exactly what I need. It's not as commercial as Starbucks and they have a variety of beans available for purchase. They can grind the beans for me since I use Keurig. The prices are not bad either. I will definitely go back for more delicious coffee beans."
999,java-girl-new-york,2018-12-03,4.0,"Cute little local coffee shop with a quirky vintage/antique-shop-like vibe. I grabbed a small coffee for about $3, and their flavor of the day was Chocolate Pretzel. I really enjoyed the flavor; it wasn't too strong like some flavored coffees, just had a subtle chocolate flavor with a hint of salt. They do pretty latte art as well. The drinks are pricier than Dunkin, but about the same as Starbucks. The downside is that even though it's such a cute shop with a great vibe, it's super small and crowded inside and each table could only fit one laptop with no room for books. There weren't even any tables available at all when I was there. It looks inviting, but realistically, it would be really difficult to stay for a while and work. More likely, you'd end up having to grab a drink to-go."
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-12-18,5.0,This is the cutest *$#@%ing coffee shop I've ever seen. It looks like the perfect place for a meet-cute in a movie. I swear if you don't see Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in this place steal a kiss...
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-10-06,4.0,"Super cute and cozy place to relax, meet a friend, study or read. I like the array of teas and usual lineup of coffee styles. I stayed for a while and bought 2 drinks and a light lunch of tuna (was ok) and chips. My mocha was nearly cold and the staff could've been a little warmer so this prevented the 5th. But all else was really good. I really like the variety of things to nibble on from tuna salad, egg salad, pastry, even soups and other quick and ready items that I assume will heat up for you. Another great thing about this place is the prices for the prepared food was very reasonable ($5.50 for tuna and chips). Also bought some cute handmade gloves on my way out!"
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-10-07,3.0,Used to love this place and it's still an quaint little cafe that I'd love to be - but the coffee now tastes burnt to me. And I've been back multiple times hoping it was just that day. Too bad.
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-07-20,1.0,"Owner is very unhappy person she was talking with customer loudly and my phone rang-it was my dr. Coffee place is near Sloan's Kettering. She should just keep her mouth shut talking about me to her customers. I wasn't even on phone that long she kept pointing to no cell phone sign. Is it really fair for people to talk to each other and I take a call and speak very low ? You tell me. I have bought several gift cards. 
Coffee is ok, lattes are terrible she must use the cheapest espresso on the market. Place is empty it's a 110 degree day, however I had to stop in for a ice tea it's not bad. Seats are very uncomfortable she has pillows everywhere but doesn't like you to use them. 
I think it's time she close this business."
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-08-16,4.0,Coffee shop on the UES. I had some time to kill waiting for my hotel check in so I figured I'd get some work done. The place smells like coffee which I loved. A few scattered table with benches along the walls made it a quaint little place. Got an iced coffee that was pretty good but I'm not a picky coffee drinker so can't rate it. There was a constant flow of people coming in and out. They place coffee shop music in the background that makes for a nice ambiance but might distract someone trying to study as I had ear plugs in and could still hear it. The one bad thing was that the benches along the wall were pretty uncomfortable. There are pillows but not something that was suitable to sit on. Overall a nice little shop with its own authentic feel. I'd recommend some cushions for the benches along the walls and a bit less volume on the music but I'd come back if I was in the neighborhood.
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-09-17,2.0,Almond croissants is so dry ! There were no filling inside at all...so disappointed. Atmosphere is nice tho.
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-10-19,2.0,"Fantastic coffee - but the lady who owns java girl is INCREDIBLY rude. All she ever does is walk table to table and bother the customers whether they're just sitting there quietly by themselves, or quietly enjoying themselves with friends. 

She is a basically the coffee shop dictator and doesn't allow outside food, drinks, pets, talking, talking on the phone, cell phones or just overall enjoying yourself...unless she's breaking the ""rules"" of course. 

I wish someone would buy the place from her because she is the worst and ruins the customer experience for everyone. I came with someone and we were at two separate tables on a Saturday (extremely small one person tables) each doing work on our laptops, and she saw us say something to each other and then walked over to us and asked us to move to the same squished table so others can sit at the other table. First of all lady... you can clearly see the tables can only fit one laptop, and you see us both doing work so mind your own business and leave us alone. Second of all, what kind of small business owner treats paying customers this way?

It's such a shame because the coffee is fantastic."
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-09-12,5.0,"I love this coffee shop. The only place I frequent in the ues that doesn't feel corporate or stiff. It's so cosy and relaxing. I like that they keep the no talking on cell phone rule. It keeps the relaxing atmosphere well, relaxing. I have never witnessed any rudeness from staff. Atmosphere is why I come here and it's lovely."
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-01-26,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place, as it's a really cute coffee shop and it looks like they have a nice selection of coffee beans for purchase. 

However, I was very disappointed with my drink and the transaction process. I paid with my credit card and as the barista moved to return my credit card, I reached out to take it from her, but instead she just slapped it on the counter. That was so weird. Is it a cultural thing?

On to the drink. She prepared my shots of espresso and once they'd finished, she went to get the milk, then came back to stream it. The shots sat for a couple minutes before she added the milk. The result was a very bitter flat white. And the dairy tasted like butter, but not in a pleasant way. I couldn't drink it and tossed it."
999,java-girl-new-york,2020-01-18,4.0,"Place is great and has all different types of coffees! Have been coming here for years. The only downfall is that the employees are always new, barley speaking English and tend to ask multiple times what I've ordered before getting my coffee right."
999,java-girl-new-york,2018-02-18,4.0,"Java Girl has been my go-to for catching up over coffee in the neighborhood. If you don't want that sleek chain feel at Gregory's, Joe or Starbucks, Java Girl is your best bet. It feels like a little coffee shop in a small town; slightly kitschy, tiny, and mismatched. It's a cozy spot to read the paper, chat with a friend, and unwind. Drink and snack prices are reasonable, and 50 cents to a dollar lower than most of the other coffeeshops in the area. The drip coffee is reliably good, while the mocha is often lacking in both espresso and chocolate power. There are gift items of various sorts to peruse and purchase for yourself or as a gift for a coffee/tea lover in your life, plus assorted other cutesy home items.  

My only gripe is that all drinks are served in paper cups. I accept that it's often too busy to get a seat quickly, and that some of the seats aren't super comfy. I accept that nondairy milks cost extra because it's a standard practice in coffee shops all across the country. (But, you know, maybe lower it to .25 cent extra instead? Or have one in the milk and sugar station? Or not charge if it's just a splash?) I do not, however, accept that there's no choice about the disposable cups -- hot drinks just taste better in a mug, and holding a mug feels so much better than holding a paper cup."
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-07-25,5.0,Awesome coffee and gf cookies! Owner was super nice. You can also buy the coffee by the half or whole pound. Super freshly roasted.  Highly recommended.
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-12-23,3.0,"Stopped by here during a work break since I have walked by it before and the place looked interesting. The place is definitely cute and nice to sit at it has a nice vibe and funky decorations and entertaining with the games. Yet I really did not like the coffee at all. To me it was not strong, it tasted rather watery to me. I did not mind the self serve. Ambiance over coffee in my opinion for this place."
999,java-girl-new-york,2018-09-14,1.0,"Wow, they totally just lost three customers. Two of my friends and I are pretty regular at this cafe, and every time the service is terrible. They are NEVER friendly to us. But we take it since we like the atmosphere of the cozy cafe. I always get a chai since I don't drink coffee, which is made from a concentrate so not good either. 

But this time we sat and were working on our laptops on a Friday afternoon (as pretty much everyone does in a coffee shop in the 21st century). We all bought drinks and I bought an extra granola bar bc they have no good healthy breakfast food options-- btw this granola bar was $3. 

One of the staff came up to us and instructed us to all squish into one small table ""because we were together."" Each table only fits one laptop. And we should be able to sit where we would want. When we explained that we were working and needed the space she said (very rudely) ""Well we are cafe for people to hang out."" When we then explained that if we needed to move we have to leave, since we wouldn't have place for our laptops so we could work, she just walked away. 

We left and didn't make a scene but definitely never going here again."
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-03-19,4.0,Great little place with a good selection of teas and friendly staff. Nice to find a place to stop and relax.
999,java-girl-new-york,2018-01-21,5.0,"I adore this place!  It is small and busy, so it is not the place if you want to sit down. I don't think I have ever been in there when a seat was available, and I go there at least 3 times a week.  But, the reason it is always full is because it is quite pleasant, and the service very fast and nice.  The prices are quite typical of NYC; my large Americano is $3.70.  If you like tea, they sell lots of kinds of exotic teas from jars on the back wall. I think I notice things like this because I just moved from the land of tea (Britain), though I am not actually a tea kind of gal. Anyway if you are in the Upper East Side and need a pick-me-up, Java Girl is the place!"
999,java-girl-new-york,2018-04-17,5.0,"I walked past this cafe at least 50 times before I decided to go in. I was always intrigued by it because of all the people that would sit outside the cafe to chat and sip on coffee. It also just looked like a cute and intriguing rustic cafe. 

I decided to pop in one day, and the second I walked in I was cast into this coffee scent cloud. The amazing coffee smell was coming from the bags of coffee beans on one side of the cafe. I was overwhelmed with the number of choices and decided to go with the drink that was featured on the chalkboard in front of the cafe. It was a coconut almond latte and it was so delicious. I had my coworkers all try it and they went later on in the day for their own cups.

I would definitely want to go back for a cup of their coffee to go back to the basics so that I can appreciate their coffee."
999,java-girl-new-york,2018-04-22,5.0,Love this little cozy cafe. It has a rustic feel and plenty of different coffee beans to choose from if you are looking for something to take home. I got a cafe latte which was quite tasty and not bitter.  The pear turnover is really flaky and delicious. How can you not love a place with the tag line: 'indescribably exotic and sometimes nutty!'
999,java-girl-new-york,2018-03-28,5.0,My latte was delicious with lots of foam. The shop is very cute. I loved the decorations and cute mugs for sale. I just wish they served coffee in mugs and not just paper cups. I would definitely go back.
999,java-girl-new-york,2017-04-22,4.0,A quaint little coffee shop to meet up. Quiet area near Sloan Kettering. Plenty of coffee bean choices for sale.
999,java-girl-new-york,2016-10-11,3.0,"Hmm this one is tough...I really enjoyed the ambience, the little shop was cute and has had a warm home-feeling; yet the espresso itself was, really disappointing - a bit on the light side and did not carry enough flavor from the espresso beans. 

Definitely stop by and visit if you plan on taking some hand-made decorations; yet I would suggest a pass for coffee purposes.

10 dollar minimum for card."
999,java-girl-new-york,2018-10-09,4.0,My favorite coffee spot on the UES hands down. I used to come here almost every weekend day when I lived in the area. Now when ever I'm around I like to pop in. It makes an excellent first date code spot. A cozy atmosphere closer to the cafes I loved up in Massachusetts. Where things are done a little slower and with more care.
999,java-girl-new-york,2018-10-16,5.0,"Locals love this cozy spot, so international travelers will be happy they read this review. The glorious smell of fresh burlap sacks of coffee beans from around the world and the aroma of the daily brews meet you as soon as you open the door. The owner is always there and her wonderful smile and artwork welcomes the weary traveler. If you love to enjoy coffee in a warm atmosphere, this place is worth a trip out of your way, but there is not enough room here to open up a laptop computer; if you want to do that or have a business meeting, go to Starbucks."
999,java-girl-new-york,2018-11-24,5.0,Great cozy llittle ocal cafe on 66th street serving coffee and some pastries. I come here instead of Starbucks or other lame big chains. Staff are nice and friendly.
999,java-girl-new-york,2019-05-15,5.0,"Great healthy lunch options in fridge , I believe $6.80 for a huge thing of chicken salad. Variety of coffees...self serve and looks like a sweet little hippy cafe."

999,java-girl-new-york,2019-03-06,5.0,"Fantastic little local owned coffee shop - a haven from the ever increasing chains that have overtaken the city.

999,java-girl-new-york,2016-11-13,4.0,"Cutest coffee shop I've seen in the UES. Very cozy and warm and coffee tastes amazing and they have a great selection of pastries and there's seating space for comfortable studying or reading. They even sell coffee beans, which after tasting the coffee, I'm tempted to purchase.

But... that $10 credit card minimum and no wifi ruins it for me. Wish this place had wifi. It could have been my new local study spot."

Many senior people and people of color will take offense to this because during JIm Crow period in American History this was how store owners showed they did not want to do business with people of color.

I can only hope she does not treat her very nice employees in the same regard. Good coffee but I'm sadly officially boycotting this coffee as of today (after going here 3 years) due to the unsolicited and blatant disrespect from the owner.

You can also buy the coffee by pound which is what I do sometimes."

Due to the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure if I wanted to waste my time and money trying this place, but one morning while visiting, I wanted a quick breakfast, so my daughter and I tried it. I was pleasantly surprised! Their lattes were very good. And although their food appears to be prepackaged, it was still very good. I recommend this place if you want a break from Starbucks and need a coffee and quick breakfast!"
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2019-07-11,3.0,"They have a Pret on the East Coast and had no idea they even existed until I visited London this year. I tried to many different food from this restaurant that I would say they have plenty of variety for every person to enjoy. 

I would say the thing I do enjoy the most is their ready packed sandwiches. If you aren't too hungry they even have half a sandwich packed and ready for you to take to your office. 

Had the chicken noodle soup which tasted pretty good and really filling. If you want a pretty good lunch option this is the place to be. 

But what saddens me is if you go a little bit later after lunch the options are way limited to what to decide from. 

Also the bathrooms at this location were some what insane at how not clean they were."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2019-11-24,4.0,"My boyfriend bought me a tea from here when I was getting ready one morning and it tasted really good. I really like how they have honey in stock to sweeten beverages with. My peppermint tea tasted great and had the perfect level of sweetness after adding the honey to my drink. 

My boyfriend also ordered a coffee and be really enjoyed his drink. There were a few milk options and he said it was really good. 

Would we return?
Absolutely!!!"

It was very good. Flavorful and the butternut added that extra bang to it ! I really enjoyed it

There is nothing unique about this particular Pret; in fact it's quite similar to most other Prets. There's a decent amount of seating, but most people usually grab a meal to-go. My favorite item on their menu is the Mediterranean Mezze Salad - it's so healthy, vibrant, and colorful. It consists of falafel, butternut squash, Beet Hummus (a gorgeous fuchsia color!), pomegranate seeds, beets, a mesclun base, harissa chickpeas (adds a nice spicy kick), mint, dukkah spice, and turmeric dressing to top it off! Eating it honestly brightens my day :) In addition, this meal contains enough protein to fill you up for the rest of the afternoon, with the generous portion of falafel and chickpea. 

This Pret is located conveniently in Midtown next to a ton of office buildings, and the line moves quickly - perfect for an office lunch run."

I only wish there were more vegan choices and less sodium in the food.
Please review this, thanks."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2018-12-02,2.0,We stopped in for coffee while visiting NY. It was just ok. It seemed to be a relatively busy place and the staff kept things moving but I just didn't think the coffee was worth going back for.
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2018-07-26,3.0,Love Prets for their croissants. Picked up a pre-made sausage breakfast sandwich and a croissant. Delicious for a quick meal. It can busy in the morning but the line moves quickly.
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2020-03-08,1.0,"Normally this is my go-to-place.....unfortunately sad to say not anymore.  I would stay away from stopping by on a Sunday as the current cashier in place cares more about proving her knowledge of inventory and new york laws as oppose to simply serving a customer.   It's scary to see someone take so much pride in memorizing a menu and yet not use common sense to better serve customers.  Case in point, Hi can I get a 24 oz Cafe Latte? Granted the menu says Latte Large (20 oz) and Not Cafe Latte....forgive my error, I take full responsibility.   Response: A What? Cafe Latte? We don't have a cafe latte.  You want an iced latte she proceeds to say, that's 24oz, the latte is 20oz. No, I would like a large cafe (hot) Latte. Needless to say, a point to the board above her head seemed to have demystified her confusion.  Well, that's a 20 oz we don't have a 24 oz latte she says to her satisfaction.   Here's the thing, this normally wouldn't bother me, things happen, miscommunications, bad days, good days...you name it,  it's no big deal...BUT it's the ATTITUDE in which I was being addressed that irked me the most.   After the coffee is served she leaves it and the other purchased item on the counter and turns to do something else.  She doesn't acknowledge that the transaction is done nor does she offer a bag.  When I ask for a bag, all I get is a sour look and ""it's 5 cents"". I have now interrupted her from doing another thing because I dared to ask for a bag.  Noticing the surprised look on my face and assuming I wasn't aware of NYS Law. She proceeds to give an impromptu unwarranted education about how plastic bags are banned and how paper bags are now 5 cents.  My surprise was not because I wasn't' aware of the law but because until yesterday this establishment was not charging anything for their bags.  I'm ok with paying the 5 ct. and I'm with fine establishments catching up and adjusting their policies.  However, what would have been nice was for her to finish my order completely, turn to me and ask if I would like a bag and not make an assumption that I wouldn't need one to then turn around and do something else.  Simple courtesy goes a long way.  Suffice to say, while I recognize my error in all this, I am saddened by the experience as a whole.  The rest of the employees are great."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2018-03-18,4.0,"Love the mission statement! Was actually at the new location right across from Central Park but its not on yelp yet. The worker, guy, don't know his name, was super friendly. Let us stay inside waiting for our Lyft even though he was closing up.

1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2019-04-28,3.0,"It is spacious, fairly quiet for midtown and clean. You can't go wrong to grab a quick snack though on Sunday there are not much options left when it comes to pastries. Three stars because they have the damn air blasting on when the temperature has dropped drastically outside, it is Spring. The staff is codicil but bring a sweater if you plan to stay on a chiller night to go to Joe, more body heat."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2019-03-16,1.0,"On a trip to New York, we were going to try this for breakfast and brought our food up to the counter to pay. At first the girl behind the counter ignored us but after awhile that got awkward so she called for another employee to help. She yelled to him.--""There's a customer, I can't be helping them because I'm going to be off soon. Come up here."" Really? He came up not really knowing what to do, he'd been sweeping up and evidently didn't serve customers. Awkward but we still wanted to buy our breakfast food. 

We said all the coffee was gone and asked him if there was any freshly brewed. But he didn't know about the coffee and called for someone in back.
By now it was clear that Pret A Manger doesn't train their employees--customer service is not important. We gave up and left, then stopped at a nearby bakery, and what a difference. They greeted us warmly and were glad to see us. That's the way it should be. Do yourself a favor and avoid this location."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2019-04-20,4.0,"Always visit pret to get my all time favorite tomato get soup and grilled cheese. Great organic and fresh food made daily. Service is fast. I recently became pescarían looking to transition to vegan, a great place for people with dietary restrictions like me. The variety/ selections is incrediBle they are able to accommodate everyone's need. Catering is offered which is a great plus."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2019-09-24,5.0,Always go here when I can't decide what to eat for breakfast. My favorites are the ice green tea and butter croissant. Best of all Stephanie and Isaac are amazing they are friendly and always have smiley faces.

Stopped in for coffee 
They ran out of coffee , half n half . Finally the lazy obnoxious kids behind the counter made some for us but they said they didn't have lids for the coffee cups..of course we walk out without coffee lids and boom coffee spills all over my wife's coat .. 
Piss poor , lazy and ignorant ..too many options walk by this one .. 

Hope the management there takes ownership and hires some people that have some sort of care about anything .."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2017-08-12,5.0,"We stayed at a hotel right around the corner so we visited often. Great place to grab a drink, pastry, sandwich or some fruit to head over to Bryant Park and enjoy the sights and sounds. 

Pastries were always fresh, day or night, sandwiches were all good and a solid choice.  Prices were fair and employees were efficient and pleasant!  All members in our party chose food and drinks from this spot as opposed to the Whole Foods across the street.

Worth a stop in while out and about in the city. If nothing more to grab the fresh squeezed lemonade/fresh brewed ice tea mix."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2018-03-19,5.0,"Love what this place stands for.  Organic coffee, food with no dates because at the end of the day food are not thrown but offered to charity."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2019-06-04,2.0,"Pret used to be okay but it keeps ruining things with stupid attempts at being pretend healthy. The Caesar salad is no longer edible since they make it with kale and Parmesan crisps instead of croutons. They also have a Caprese sandwich that they put artichoke hearts on. That's objectively disgusting. And they got rid of the carrot cake, which was their best item."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2018-11-15,5.0,"Hot food, affordable prices, nice staff, moved the large groups of morning rush hour through the lines quickly and everything is tasty! We always look for food and coffee to go whenever we are in London, New York or traveling. I had the sausage, egg breakfast sandwich with 12 oz dark coffee. I also had the ham and cheese baguette for lunch when I was on sightseeing bus through Manhattan. Their prices were appropriate and looking forward to stopping by the next Pret when traveling."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2018-05-21,2.0,"Found this place on a whim, and it feels very New York. Quick in and out, grab and go style. The man on the floor helped me find what I needed and was kind. At the checkout though the lady was very rude and had a horrible attitude. I got a coffee to go, a chocolate chip croissant and yogurt with fruit. Horrible service and coffee, good yogurt & croissant. Fair prices. Overall won't return."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2017-12-15,2.0,"For such high prices, you don't get what you pay for. All Pret A Manger restaurants have a wide selection of food, but not for those who want a hearty meal. Their sandwiches are egregiously overpriced for the quantity offered.
They want you to order ample food and waste more money - this is why their servings are so tiny. 
The coffee is very good and the staff is ok - some seem less enthused to be working at the establishment."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2017-03-05,5.0,"The bottom line with Pret: as the name implies the food is ready to eat.  There food is very good, reasonably priced, and extremely close to where I work.  They also list critical nutrition information such as sodium and calories, which help me make better decisions.  In that regard, unlike other establishments they actually have choices that are low sodium or lower in calories that are also tasty.  Therefore, you don't just sit there feeling bad about the incredible number of calories you're going to consume simply by eating there.  Finally, the food is very fresh and the staff are extremely nice and accommodating.

Definitely swing by if you need a quick meal and you want to make sure you're not blowing your food budget ($$$ or calories) on sub par food."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2016-12-31,5.0,I love Pret. Discovered my time in London. From hot to cold sandwiches. Great service and decor and it looks clean. Sandwiches are great with many selections as well!
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2017-02-04,5.0,"Really nice Pret to drop in for a coffee, breakfast, or lunch. This location is run very well with friendly staff, efficient control of lines at the registers, and typically well-stocked items including coffee in the morning. They even have soy milk for the coffee. Some of their sandwiches and soups are saltier than I'd like, but I'm sure this location can't control that.

Bottom line: I'd come back here for good coffee and a quick meal on the go."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2017-04-29,5.0,"Pret is one of my favorite places to grab lunch. The food is always fresh and tasty. It doesn't matter what I've tried, hot or cold, I've always liked it. My favorites are the spicy shrimp and cilantro wrap, the bang bang chicken wrap and now the new chicken burrito! It's amazing. I also LOVE the banana, honey and almond Greek yogurt and the little lemonade and orange juices. The sandwiches/wraps run under $10. The yogurt will run you $4, but all in all, it's worth it."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2018-05-15,2.0,"Their service and food quality are very inconsistent. Every day is different. Not sure if the store operation is not manualized. Sometimes coffee pots are empty although there are not only one pot there. I like their breads but sometimes over cooked. Store staff service is mediocre. I go there because I work near the store, but lately I go to other places."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2017-03-27,5.0,"Wow, I'm just really blown away with this restaurant. The line moves fast and there are so many options to choose from. I got a small chicken noodle soup (and the free tortilla that comes along with it!), and it tasted great. Even more, my favorite part of my experience at Pret was the service.

I was there for under 10 minutes, but the employees were so kind and friendly. My cashier was sweet and even told me to ""Stay warm"" as I left.

So much love for you, Pret."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2016-10-19,4.0,Like most Prets you have been to. The food is pretty good and leans towards the healthier side. I recommend the Chicken burrito.
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2018-06-03,4.0,Wow loving this mocha hazelnut coffee! The cashier was super nice!!!!! Love that atmosphere
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2014-06-09,5.0,"This location is nearby so I go there a lot. I tend to like the chain in general. The food is fresh and they mix up the menu items once in a while so I do not get bored. 
There is a new soup I want to try - Spanish Meatball. Sounds yummy. 
For gluten free options, go for the salads. 
I  a big fan of the yogurts in the morning. The cup of fruit always looks good, but I think it is overpriced.
Also - the multigrain muffin with flex seeds is a nice ""pick me up"" for the 4pm energy slump."

Pret used to have wonderful tea and now it's awful.  Yuck."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2016-07-23,2.0,"I used to love it but someone decided to fix what ain't broke. Now it's just OK.

Still some great sandwiches but desserts are now limited to run of the mill baked goods. Biggest gripes: you have to wait in the same line to pay for your food as the people there just ordering a coffee drink, so you're waiting forever for the barrista to create someone else's drinks just so you can pay for your grub.

And some executive determined that the MUSIC MUST BE PLAYED VERY LOUDLY AND CANNOT BE TURNED DOWN AT ANY STORE DESPITE CONTINUAL COMPLAINTS FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS."
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2018-03-05,3.0,Perfect little place to grab an inexpensive coffee and snack before a show or on your way to Central Park. Well lit and clean bathrooms right off 6th Avenue across the street from the Hilton.

1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2017-12-08,1.0,I can not believe how rude one of the young guys working here was. I'll just leave it at that but I hope his boss sees his bad attitude towards customers he doesn't even know and gets fired. What a jerk!
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2016-05-30,5.0,Stopped here for a quick breakfast. The staff here is very friendly. The brioche eggs bacon and cheese sandwich hit the spot. Followed by orange juice which tasted like my homemade cold pressed OJ. The coffee too here is very good. If you like it black or light and sweet. Espresso or cappuccino.  They got you covered.
1000,pret-a-manger-new-york-12,2017-10-04,4.0,"Clean, fresh, ready to go healthy food. A great grab and go option for lunch in NYC.

I ordered the Pastrami Egg and Cheese Breakfast sandwich ($6.50) in a Spinach wrap and a Chicken Club Panini which comes with a soda and chips ($8.95). Everything arrived on time! Order is correct. Everything is packed nicely. Cost is perfect. Good sizes and very filling! The chicken in the panini is breaded, which I didn't know. It tastes very good! I'm so full I shared the other half with a co-worker who also said it was very good! The pastrami egg and cheese breakfast wrap is AMAZING! Highly recommend. It's very filling. I loved it so much I ate it all even though I was super full haha. Everything arrived hot and fresh. So filling! I've ordered from here beforeNo problems."

They also make a solid godfather hero so what else can I ask for? Myself included we live by a ton of bodegas but I do not order from skyline for convenience. I order from them because I love their sandwiches and I really like what they have to offer. I can get watermelon salad delivered anytime, WHAT. Thanks so much skyline."

1001,skyline-gourmet-deli-new-york,2019-03-16,4.0,"Well its 1:00 AM, very hungry and strolling around near my hotel and I run into this wonderful 24/7 deli!

I definitely did a pass by before realizing they were a full deli versus a convenience store. After making a sharp u turn, I walked into what I thought was a god send at that time of the morning. They offer your standard sandwiches and various other to go type meals. I directed my attention to the pastrami sandwich as it sounded great at the time to help with the amount of alcohol in my system. The staff was super friendly and got the sandwich out right away, so no complaints there. Price point was very approachable for everything! On top of to go food, they offer snacks as well, so its a one stop type of mini mart for all your food and drink needs. 

Cannot thank them enough for my hunger problem at such a early morning time (Yeah, clearly a west coaster here). Would gladly make a re visit again if in the area in the future."

I fully recommend this place!"

I've been to at least 10 other delis in this place has the absolute best sandwiches. The meat is always super fresh and they do a excellent meat to lettuce ratio.

But recently, the service has been poor. The wait time is horrible. I've ordered inside the store multiple times and many times, I've had to wait longer than 20 minutes for a breakfast sandwich. I ordered on grub hub this morning. My order took 50 minutes to be delivered (ETA was supposed to be 35 min). I literally live one block away, but was too busy at home to leave and wait inside a store for 30 min. This morning, I ordered three plain bagels with butter (toasted) and a sausage/egg/cheese sandwich. My bagels arrived cold and were not toasted! Who eats a cold, untoasted bagel with butter? This is not the first time my order came late, cold, or incorrect. There are other deli stores in Hell's Kitchen, next time I will consider trying a new one."

Sounds like they do a better job on other kinds of sandwiches."
1001,skyline-gourmet-deli-new-york,2018-03-04,1.0,"This is possibly the worst option on Grubhub I've ever seen. I've tried to order from them more than 5 different times. Their address is 3 blocks from me and yet every time they cancel my order an hour after confirmation, then have the audacity to tell me some lame excuse that ""we're too busy today and don't feel like doing deliveries"". OK, that's fine -  but don't advertise yourself as a reliable and great choice on a DELIVERY app if you can't keep up with basic customer demands. 

Either extremely lazy people or they don't at all care about their customers. Don't know which is worse. Get off Grubhub and spare others from the same plight."

We got breakfast here every day except one and Weren't disappointed. They ran out of bagels and a couple other things one morning but we did arrive a little later for breakfast (around 1030) so that's understandable. 

They have delivery for the neighborhood and are super quick with it too. If you need a late night fix just order it up like room service. Give them a reasonable tip and they're happy. No complaints for these guys at all!"

The breakfast clientele (2 times I was there) was construction workers from the projects across the street.  The line moves quickly.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  The food is on the high end for such outlets. My Sausage, Egg and Cheese on an Onion Bagel was above average. Muffins mass produced and big. Coffee decent. The prices are remarkably modest. 

Can't do much better than Skyline Gourmet for a 24/7 eats and drinks."

A coworker went there to place the order after everyone wrote down their orders, 2 employees both wanted pastrami (1 with lettuce and tomato and 1 without). Coworker comes back and both pastrami had lettuce tomato. I went there thinking I'm a frequent customer so they'll just switch them out no problem. I get to Skyline and they tell me my coworker got my sandwich (without lettuce and tomato) so they charged me.. I get back to work and my coworker tells me his had lettuce and tomato too so I called Skyline back thinking they'll tell me to come back for a refund, instead they tell me we ordered both with lettuce and tomato (changed their story). They didn't do right by the customer, sad...

They prepared and packaged the sandwich so quickly it was amazing. As I was paying, the cashier got distracted for a split second because he was jammin' to Drake's ""One Dance"" playing on the radio but that was completely understandable - that song is killer - and it resulted in a fun memory for me on this trip.

 Def recommend + super cheap"
1001,skyline-gourmet-deli-new-york,2017-02-27,5.0,"I have tried all the delis in the area and this is my favorite for sandwiches. I live two blocks away and probably order 1-3 times a week, because I really like Ham, Egg and Cheese sandwiches. 

Which, by the way I've done the research and they do make the best Ham, Egg and Cheese and pretty much any sandwich out of the 5-10 deli's in a ten block radius.

Prices are completely reasonable for the quality and area. Any complaints on the price for some items ignore the fact that the extra $0.50 - $1.00 adds an exponential amount of quality. Hands down, even the hero bread is better quality. But really it's competitively priced.

Out of ordering many times I've only had one issue and it was completely fair mistake. I got Chocolate Cherry Garcia instead of Vanilla, a quick call and they immediately fixed the problem and apologized profusely.

The guy working the counter and delivery guys have been only nice to me and they've got me as a loyal customer."

The store had a bit of everything as well, from diapers to drinks. The staff friendly and always recognized a returning face.  

The cheesecake and salads are good for a desert or light snack.

It was clean, bright and has places to sit and eat and watch financial news. Their was a large assortment of pastries, cakes, cookies that look fresh like they were place there today.  Lots of Coffee options, drinks, and juice.

I think it had at least 6 workers behind the counter and they were quick to service me.

I got meal pal here which had a croque monsieur, side salad, and a financier

I was excited all morning for this!!

Turns out it wasn't as good as I expected but not as bad as I was afraid it can get. 

You can't expect the croque monsieur to have bubbly hot cheese when you're bringing it back and this is mealpal where food is prepped ahead of time. So that was fine. I'm thinking if they kept the food near a heater because it was warm when they gave me the bag. Ofc not warm anymore when i got back to my desk. 

Croque monsieur
The bechamel was the worst part of all this. It's quite tasteless, yes I tried it on its own. It just adds a goopey texture to everything which I'm not a fan on. 
The bread was slightly chewy though I think it could be softer and more toasted. 
The gruyère on top was probably the best part, adding great flavor and savoriness. 
The top of this looks oily but it was fine when eating so that's aight 

Mixed greens
So disappointed how they gave a dressing that was like diluted mayo with some pepper. I don't want just mayo as a dressing. Also shouldn't they give something more refreshing in contrast to the sandwich. 
The greens themselves were dry. Some leaves were also not as green. 

Financier 
Cute small touch to this meal. First time I've gotten a snack/dessert from mealpal meals. 
It was surprisingly good, a soft sugary outside (slightly crusty, not crystalized). Inside is so airy and buttery. Yummy. One to end the meal was perfect."

He went to go get it and I saw it was VERY burnt. He went to make me to new one. So after waiting about  30 minutes I finally get my spinach feta and it was cold."

For all its pretty delicacies on display, the customer service was horrific when I pointed out that my salmon salad order has dirty foreign matters in it (see pic). If i have the option I would give this negative star.

Full story- I ordered the Au Saumon Salad via MealPal today 12/17/18. Now please remember MealPal does not cook the food, Financier does. I found brown clay-like matter sticking to the salad leaves (see photos below). It almost feels like a patch of frozen dirt. I brought the salad back to the store and inquired what that thing is. This is at around 2 to 3 pm. The lady at the MealPal counter right the way told me to contact MealPal for a credit. She then took the salad and told me to give her my contact so she can let me know what that foreign object is. She proceeded to peel off the Financier label and I got alarmed. When I asked her what she is doing, she rudely said ""don't tell me how to do my job!""

At this point I frankly pointed out that she is trying to get rid of the company label. She got more defensive and barked back ""if you know then why you ask?!""

Not only did that female bakery staff NOT apologize for the unclean food right the way, she 1) SHIFTED the responsibility to MealPal (again MealPal does NOT cook Financier's food), 2) tried to DESTROY EVIDENCE on the Salad bowl label, 3) not even offer a replacement (not that I would want a other one)

This is such a bad reflection on the bakery! I caution anyone and everyone ordering food from this specific location of Financier!!!!!"

Each of the 4 people I interacted with was extremely rude. It took a while to get anyone's attention for help. When I was able to find someone, and she said they couldn't locate the cakes, I tried telling her the type of cake. She cut me off abruptly, yelling ""we have so many cakes back there"", only to ask for the same information 2 minutes later. When they finally located my cakes,  they chastised me for ordering the cake by phone instead of online.

It was a cute set up when I walked in but at that time in the afternoon they didn't have that many pastries available which was a bit disappointing so we just opted for drinks.

My friend wanted a cold brew but they only had iced coffee so she ordered that and said it was disgusting. I ordered a chai latte which was alright. I liked that it wasn't too sweet, but it was kind of expensive considering I got the smallest size. I do like the little mini cakes you get with your drink I think that's a cute idea and they tasted great. 

The seating is okay but kind of limited. Also one of the set of doors kept opening and shutting by the wind which was kind of annoying, and they should probably do something about that.

Overall my tea was okay but too expensive (almost $4 for a small) and I don't think I would be back anytime soon."

This is where Financier Patisserie has a hit or miss, but mostly a miss. Got a couple boxes of assorted this and that. I can't name all the pastries by name that were in the box but let's start with my least favorite, a white chocolate or possibly cheesecake with a pink fruity syrup on top. This would have been an example of don't use fruity flavors with chocolate or cheesecake. Didn't taste that great. Other than that I thought all the others were well done including another that was actually chocolate cake with a raspberry on top.

Liked the Lintzer cookies, they were crisp, had a unique football shape, center filled with a lightly sweet -tart jam. Some of the other pastries were very crisp just like the Lintzer cookie, well done. A very thick crisp.

Liked the chocolate mousse cake, fudge like.

All but one of the cakes and pastries I admit were very good with these words to described them: soft, smooth, designed well, subtle in flavor like light notes of chocolate and sweet but not too sweet.

I ordered a chocolate croissant and a glass of orange juice and coffee. The kids ordered a variety of pastries and juices.
The pastries were flaky, fresh and hot! We couldn't have picked a better place. There was no line and plenty of seating for us. It looks like there are locations throughout the city. The staff was friendly and helpful. The decor is chic and remind us of an authentic patisserie in Paris. They offer flour less pastries along with a wide variety of delectable options.
We give this location our highest recommendation!"
1002,financier-patisserie-new-york-30,2015-09-16,3.0,I've walked pass this place a couple of times. I was attracted by the unusually large macarons in the display that I just had to try it. My friend got the Hazelnut macaron and I got the Cherry and Dark Chocolate macaron. They tasted pretty average. The other pastries in the display did not look as appealing either. This place could do better.
1002,financier-patisserie-new-york-30,2014-07-13,2.0,"I had to drop two stars from this one.  I came in for lunch one day and ordered a chicken soup. By god, the chicken soup was amazing but that's not the point.  The point is that the service here was terrible.  After being seated, my friend who got her oatmeal was given it in 5 minutes.  Sounds good right?

Wrong.  Their menu is unfortunately loaded with a bunch of items that they have not carried for months or do not have in stock.  Like if you don't have something, at least put a sign so I don't have to go through two, three items that I would assume you had before finally deciding what I can actually order.

And as for my chicken soup... It probably took 20-25 minutes.  After 10, I was looking around and one of the employees who had just gotten off asked me if I was missing something so told them I was missing a chicken soup.  Thank god he was helping me but why wasn't someone who was on the job then doing that... No word from them anyway, just a bunch of confusion.  15 minutes... Still no word.  After however long, they finally got it but was confused at which table it was meant to be taken to.  What does a girl have to around here to get a chicken soup?!

I think a lot of this has to do with the miscommunication.  Financier is located in a busy area where people cannot take two hours for lunch.  Sometimes you just want to get your soup, eat, chat, and go back to work.  Sure your chicken soup is amazing, but to be honest, hale and hearty is amazing as well and gets it to me quicker.  I suggest going to hale and hearty."

1002,financier-patisserie-new-york-30,2014-03-13,4.0,"Financier has made getting my fancy lunch fix easy. I love the quiches and sandwiches here. I order the mushroom bisque soup about twice a week. The staff are sweet and happy to help. And who can resist their delicate and beautiful pastries? I also think the coffee at this Financier is better than others and the baristas are on top of things. 

Seating can fit about 25 so don't bring a crowd. It also can feel a bit noisy from the acoustics and the espresso maker. Table clean up is frequent, which is super. In the winter, however, there is a huge draft by the door. 

Prices are the same as the other Financiers - which means lunch will run you about $12-15, and is definitely not cheap. But the choices are healthy and well portioned, while still tasting luxurious and fresh. 

Waiting for food is usually not long, and it makes me happy that my meal is served fresh and hot. They also have a grab and go cold case for salads, sandwiches, quiche, and the cold drinks. 

The location is on 47th between Park and Lex, closer to Lex and set back from the street."

Five seconds later, I saw one of the employees look at me and yell ""the line is over here!""

Also, you apparently are supposed to get a mini Financier pastry with your coffee purchases. Sometimes I get one, sometimes I don't.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason for this magic doling out of these little pastries.

My favorite is the pistachio! The raspberry and banana caramel are too sweet.

Their drinks are ok. I tried their regular iced latte and the skim iced latte. Both are not creamy enough. Friendly staff members and quick service! They have a family card which is a rewards card.

Today there were some ""down on their luck"" folks around the place, but they were quiet and respectful. The bit of empathy from the staff was evident. 
It is also obvious the locals love the place as they were friendly, chatting me up during my pop-in for a warm drink.  The vibe is laid back and the baristas are competent so they will always have a customer here."

Very slow and unorganized Starbucks"

1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2020-02-20,5.0,"This place is one of the original Starbucks that came alive when Starbucks was blooming all over the city. I've watched this place change over the years and it's still a great place to relax, get a bev and grab a bite. Could be hard to get sitting time to time but it's almost 2 blocks away from NYU and Bellevue hospitals so the foot traffic is what it is."
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2019-02-21,4.0,This is my favorite go to location of Starbucks in this area. The barista always made my coffee so good than the other location and the staffs were always friendly. The staffs are kinda rude some of other location in Manhattan. There's limited seating and difficult for get seating when you're this location.

They greet customers by name and they know their drinks. Jamaar, Raphael, Merissa but really all the employees are so great!

If you mobile order, they even put the straw in the drink. The sandwiches are always warmed to perfectly. I love comin"
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2019-03-12,5.0,"Hands down the best Starbucks I've ever been to. Going here every morning has become an integrated part of my routine. The team at this specific location are friendly, know most of their customers by name, put care into making each beverage, and go above and beyond to make your Starbucks visit great.  Seeing the bright faces of the team helps me to get my day started.  Marissa (who definitely deserves to be a manager), Nic, Marvin, Arelis, Jamie, and Cass are all so pleasant; it doesn't matter if it's 530 AM or 530 PM all of them brighten my day with a smile, a joke, or just good conversation.  I absolutely love this Starbucks team, if there were ever an Undercover Boss episode done for Starbucks, it should definitely be at this location.

I have nothing negative to say; unlike - what seems the rest of the ""Cast of Characters"" that Kvetch who visit this place. You have no need for this behavior! - At least, that's based on my judgement! :-)

Store was in an amazing location & was clean and stocked appropriately!

I did a walk-in order: venti Iced Espresso Classics - Skinny Caramel Macchiato with an extra shot (ice). And it came extremely fast with no issue and it came perfectly how I wanted it. I couldn't have been any more happier   The place is very neat and the workers were very friendly

This is the only place that I would get a Mango Dragon-fruit Refresher with a Raspberry Syrup.

 This is a 5 Star Starbucks location."

1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2018-01-24,3.0,"I   frequent this Starbucks and it's decent. It honestly depends who you have making your coffee because when you ask for a splash of milk it will either be an actual splash or 1/4 of your coffee cup, which can be frustrating. It is right near the Medical Center so it can be fairly busy during the early morning hours, however the line moves quickly for the most part. I   definitely would not come here to study, sprawl out my books and get work done. It isn't a cozy warm Starbucks, it's a get in and get out. Sure they have tables and areas to sit but people are constantly standing right in front of you while they wait on line for their coffee, it isn't really a conducive environment to getting work done in my opinion. They have your standard Starbucks food and drink, if they don't have bananas out, ask because likely they just haven't been put out yet for the day. They have a code on the bathroom, which you would think is a good thing because it keeps people who are not customers out, however the code is long, I   can never remember it and it still isn't the cleanest bathroom in the world. Overall, a decent place to stop to get in and get out, just reiterate what a splash of milk is if you only want a splash."
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2017-05-29,3.0,Great location.  Perfect for picking up on the run cause it right off the bus stop or on the way to the train. The seating is different from majority of the location but I like it cause the seats have a lot of space and you are facing away from the streets so you are free from distractions.   The service is fast and as usual and they will make them with 100% satisfaction so that is why I am a return customer.
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2017-08-03,4.0,Great Starbucks bar to get your coffee or drink. They are fast and have great customer service. They also have a large seating area with charging outlets to charge your phones or laptops/Tablets. I usually get the Strawberry Acai lemonade. I also order the cake box. I order this on the go from the Starbucks app. This is perfect the place to go before the movies or after. The amc is across the street.
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2014-11-10,3.0,"I am a newbie starbucks customer and just started exploring different drinks and other small snacks they sell. This particular store happens to be close to my job when I feel like treating myself to a frapp or chai tea. The staff seem okay and not unfriendly but busy trying to tend to customers and they do keep the lines moving quick. 

Whenever I ask questions they answer and there are no attitudes.  I've only had one bad drink (salted caramel frapp was watery) from here but my first frapp (green tea caramel) experience was from this store and I've been hooked ever since. The stores is always clean and there's a few seats for you to sit and enjoy your drinks/goodies."
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2018-07-22,5.0,This location is really great.  Perfect for pre or post movie Frappuccino or espresso as there's the kips Bay theaters across the street.  The staff is super friendly and the place is clean and love the monk fruit sweetener!
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2017-06-04,3.0,"Standard starbucks fare.  The seating is a bit awkward... back to the windows?  What the heck is that about?  Also, it's a flat uncomfortable bench.

On the plus side... hottie doctors!"
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2017-11-11,5.0,This place is always jamming when I come here. They keep their cool no matter how busy it gets. The place is very clean and a lot of people like to hang out on their laptops and just kick it so it gets crowded. The staff is very friendly and the get it done. This is one of the better locations in the city. It get crowded but the line moves fast just hard to find a spot to hang out. I like the location on will be back.
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2017-06-03,3.0,"Overall, average Starbucks. 

Coffee and food items are similar to other Starbucks in the city. And as a plus, this location is less crowded than average, and has large windows which give great lighting. It is also very clean. 

I am not sure if this is a change in corporate policy, but this Starbucks plays loud and clubby music - hip hop, R&B, house. As someone that loves to work and study in coffee shops, I find this disruptive. Starbucks used to play the soothing and relaxing coffee shop music, but this is not the case anymore. 

When I asked them nicely about music they said ""as long as there are no curse words, what's the problem"" despite the music being so loud and annoying as to disrupt me (and I'm sure many others on their laptops or reading a book). Perhaps this is the intention, to increase turnover, but it definitely makes it less pleasant to work here."
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2018-06-18,1.0,"Rude, incompetant staff. Store is a mess - trash on the tables, floors. They overcharge for drinks a lot."
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2015-07-09,3.0,"I can't really complain about this branch. Yeah, it was busy this morning but that goes for other coffee/tea shops in the city. The baristas are friendly, as one other reviewer mentioned. Even with a lot of customers, the guy making my frapp was doing his best to keep calm even with a customer berating him for giving him the wrong sized latte, the line getting longer, and other customers asking him a question.

There's a number of seats for you to just sit and hang out. Someone mentioned there's wifi but I didn't even bother to check. There are salads, sandwiches, and miscellaneous items in a chilled shelf if you're looking for a quick bite, too."
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2017-11-11,2.0,Definitely one of the dumpiest Starbucks I have been too. I am a frequent patron and long-time shareholder.  This is one SBUX I will not go to do any work at.  Just not attractive setup and backs to windows in awkward
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2017-06-07,5.0,"All black staff, playlist bangin. Playing candy crush, enjoying the music and people watching. Unemployment is amazing"
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2017-07-07,3.0,"Pretty decent location. The staff is OK and they don't always follow customized instructions. I like the location and that it's somewhat big and always has seating available. If I lived in the neighborhood, this would probably be my preferred location."
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2013-02-02,1.0,"Kind of dirty looking and definitely not one of my favorite Starbucks locations. Only reason I was here is that I was close by while my girl was in the hospital for the day. Good thing I won't have to drop by this lame-fest again.

Not much seating, narrow, and kind of grimy in here. Not too many spots to sit at overall save for a few tables and a strange bench seating area up against the front window across from the main counter area. Saw some outlets to use and most all of them were being taken over by wifi-hog staff and students coming over from NYU Hospital along with others just camping out at tables with no drinks. Would it also kill the staff to sweep up or wipe down a bit once in a while? 

Staff is kind of impersonal and on the slow side. There wasn't that many people even on line here and it seemed to drag on and on getting my drink. I didn't even bother to use the bathroom here.

Someone who also posted here said it was the best Starbucks in Midtown East? Really? Really? LMAO!!!"
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2016-02-20,3.0,"I only come to this location on Sundays. Baristas can be slow. A lot of sitting but there are many students with laptops who sit there for hours. 

Coffee is usual Starbucks coffee."
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2016-07-17,1.0,"Funny I've  been to this Starbucks many times!  And spent more than is needed for a simple cup of coffee. Or more than needed for a mediocre cup of espresso filled with foam and  a dollop of cream. Yet when my wife walks in asking for a puppoccino off the Starbucks secret menu, she was told that the item she was asking for didn't exist!!! I wonder if paying these baristas extra for the same mediocre service is actually validated? Or do we just as a society need to just suck it up? If it's the later then shame on Starbucks for not training their staff properly! 
Btw :
What is a PUPPUCCINO at Starbucks?
One of the items on the Starbuckssecret menu, the Puppuccino is a small cup filled with whipped cream for your pup, a.k.a. all things good in this world. Next time you get that grande non-fat chai latte, treat your pup to the puppuccino!"
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2015-06-07,4.0,"I'm shock to read poor reviews on this starbucks, I find the baristas to be very friendly. In my personal experience( this is before i go to work), I found this place to be very fast and they serve the best chai tea latte (hot and cold). I have to say, there is an elementary and NYU school of medicine near, and I do see a crow of moms early in the morning,after dropping off their children ,grabbing their lattes . It is usually pack in the mornings and in the afternoons with students, but it is not so bad if you are in and out. Please note, despite the fact that they are busy, the baristas still manage to get the flow going....they deserve credit."
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2016-02-20,3.0,"It's your standard Starbucks with low traffic. I've come here a couple times and their service is fine. Drinks are consistent with other Starbucks I've been to. My only gripe about this location is that there is very little space to sit, and the seats that exist are not really comfortable. Basically the only seats available is the extended windowsill.

If you need coffee on the go, then this is the place, but there are definitely better spots to stop and sit around."
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2017-05-04,5.0,"An enjoyable Starbucks, in my opinion.

I visited here while in Manhattan for the day, and my experience was positive. The staff were fast with my order; the espresso was fresh, and as I'd specified; the dining room was clean, and comfortably sized. Likewise, the bathroom was well-maintained. All in all, the restaurant proved to be a good place to sip coffee and read a book (though, one improvement I would suggest is some cushioning on the back of the bench seats, which dug into my spine in a bad way).

Much thanks to everyone who runs this restaurant. Keep up the good work :)"
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2012-05-29,2.0,"Great location and looks like one of the newer locations but that's about all the positive I can say about it.  There were straw wrappers, empty sugar packets, and napkins on the floor.  There were so many people ""camping"" out on the tables that there weren't any seats for the BF and I to just sit and enjoy our drinks.  Not to mention that the staff wasn't very nice.

I'm not usually in this neighborhood so I doubt I'll ever have to come back -- unless the theater down the street is the only one showing a movie I'm itching to watch."

1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2012-06-01,2.0,"This is a weird Starbucks. I have been here several times so it is not a one or two time slip. The vibe, the cleanness, even the taste of my usual tall cappuccino is meh~.  

Sorry."
1003,starbucks-new-york-149,2012-08-20,2.0,"These people suck at making drinks. As a former starbucks barista, I have SO MANY PROBLEMS with this place. The employees here seriously need to be retrained. 

One, they don't ask for your name. That's like, standard. 
Two, I ordered a skinny caramel macchiato. My drink only had N on the milk section. Where was the SFV? 
Three, they overfilled my cup so they had to double cup my drink. So messy. That kinda quality doesn't pass. 
Four, they called frappuccinos, ""fraps."" Uhhh, no. 

Sorry for sounding like a pretentious b*tch, but this starbucks joint just....well, sucks.

The only redeeming factor is that it's a pretty good study spot and it's a block away from my apartment. Otherwise, STAY AWAAAAY."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2020-03-06,5.0,"Amidst panic attack trying to re-center myself before hopping on the NY subway alone, I decided to look up coffee. I came across Gregory's Coffee bc of the eccentric coffee menu. I had the Nu Brew which was incredibly delicious! 

My reason for the review was bc as I was sipping my coffee I was talking to one of the baristas and her energy was contagious. Energy I needed to get thru my day. 

Thank you Adji for spreading positivity- you are a great asset to the team! Will be back soon."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2020-01-22,4.0,"I very much enjoyed our brief stop at Gregorys Coffee! It was adjacent to our hotel, so there was no excuse not to check it out. 

The little shop was pretty cute. They had a ton of seating, merchandise, display cases, etc. I really loved the earthy decor as well. 

They had a nice concise, but not limited, menu of drinks to choose from. I went the coffee route and my partner sprung for a smootie. My Nu Brew was pretty good. It's just cold brew with a Nutella twist in the situation. I enjoyed it enough. The smoothie on the other hand was just meh. It was also much too expensive for my tastes. 

The selection of pastries and snacks is awesome. I got a chia pod and I loved it. It was pretty filling and actually quite richy rich. They had a few options of that as well. 

Overall, what a nice little place to grab some coffee and a snack. I just wish I would have grabbed a bag of their coffee beans while I was there. Alas, maybe I will next time."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-12-02,5.0,"Great coffee with excellent matcha and alternate milk options. 

The staff was pretty fantastic. I came here to meet a date and it was a lovely place for a conversation. I could also see myself getting some work done on the corner if needed. Great location in Midtown to escape the shopping crowds. 

The pastries were really good in general. We tried several. Less sweet and lower sugar which made me very happy in these options. I would only suggest a more traditional approach to the carrot cake."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2020-03-06,5.0,"I enjoyed the coffee here. It is everything you can ask for in terms of friendly and quick service, positive atmosphere and most importantly, strong yet delicious coffee. Coffee shop has good, ample seating and a unique decor so I recommend checking this place out. The location is also central to everything so you won't be missing out on the fun."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-01-23,5.0,"Definitely becoming my go-to coffee shop since moving here a couple weeks ago. I'm so lucky that such a great option is right across the street from my office. I always use the app to order ahead and stop by to pick up my morning coffee before popping into work. Through using the app, I've been receiving points for each purchase, so I know I'm definitely going to reap the rewards soon just from being so close to this location!

I love the location for its cleanliness and reliability of filling my orders on time. I always get the drip coffee with an extra shot or two, and lavender syrup! It's a delicious, lightly sweet start to my morning. 

The food options look delicious and I will definitely be coming/orderinfhere for lunch a lot!"
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-05-07,5.0,"Gregory's on 46th/Mad has undergone quite a face lift in the past year. The new staff along with the returning manager Max has really made a difference. The shop looks much more vibrant, and it feels more spacious than ever before since I first visited this shop many years ago. Some of the new health and wellness drinks introduced can be a bit hit-or-miss, but it is great to have the familiarity back again for us OG Gregulars!"
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-20,4.0,"Standard coffee shop here. Absolutely nothing stuck out at me but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. All a coffee shop needs is coffee/tea, wifi, chairs, tables, and good service. If you have that it is a recipe for success. 

The space is spacious and clean. It is geniunely a nice place. The tables are small and they have some high tops so you have a good selection of places to sit. It wasn't crowded here which was positive. I ordered the green tea and my colleague ordered a coffee. She said it was a solid option for coffee. 

I didn't spend a ton of time here but for the time I spent here I enjoyed it. I would definitely come back to chill out and get some work done."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-08-22,4.0,"This is a nice coffee shop with a very new vibe. The coffee is good, and in particular, the cold brew is quite smooth. The service was quick and all in all, not a bad coffee shop.  I've walked past this place and other coffee shops for close to 4 years now since I am kinda loyal to Starbucks.  But lately I been bored with the same old same old so I'm looking for something fresh and new."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-01-04,2.0,"Gregory's, why must you be stingy with your almond milk? Take a lesson from Pret, and leave it out on the counter so I don't feel like a beggar every time I went some to go with my coffee. 

Besides that, this location is cool. Service is fast. They have a fair amount of seating, though you'll likely have to wait. People tend to take up the two-seater tables to themselves often, which I resent. 

Also, don't think they have a bathroom, but they do have strong WiFi and outlets galore. 

Tip: you get a $5 credit on the LevelUp app when you download it, and another $5 on your birthday."

1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-27,5.0,"Manager Max and crew at Gregory's Coffee were extremely hospitable during our stay at the nearby hotel, The Roosevelt for a week. My family ate breakfast here every morning, recognizing their quality ingredients in their smoothies, coffee, and hot breakfast(yes, hot vegan scrambles, etc.).  Oh, you have to try their ""peanut pleasers"" smoothie; very refreshing and tasteful, packed full of protein. 

We are from Southern Cali(don't hate us) and this place puts our typical Starbucks to shame."

1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-10-22,5.0,Best place for coffee. Great staff. I come here everyday and they are all so nice. The coffee is really good and they offer variety.
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2018-04-09,4.0,"As I've said in my review of Gregory's by Bryant Park, I really enjoy everything they serve at this chain, I haven't had a drink or a pastry here that I've disliked.

This location is good because it has a ton of seating for work or catching up with a friend but they fill up quickly. There's also a customer restroom which is always a plus. The only downside is they close so early on the weekends.

My reason for taking off a star is the employees. They are always distracted, or talking to each other and generally making you wait a long time, for no apparent reason. There's also been several times when I've ordered something (currently listed on the menu board in front of me) only to be told they don't have it with no hint of remorse. One time I ordered a maple latte and they told me I had to pick something else because the current barista ""can't make that for you."" Were they a new employee? Was the espresso machine broken? Were they out of maple? Who knows, I was given no explanation, but got a cold brew instead.
This is not a one time experience, I've come here many times to take advantage of their large seating area, and constantly had weird service experiences.
Obviously not enough to stop coming back, but it's just something to be aware of."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-01-08,3.0,"How crazy does one get with a coffee shop???? Seeing as every sixth store in midtown Manhattan is a coffee shop, I will rate this as average / above average, as we had cappuccinos and regular roast coffee. We also shared a carrot loaf which was tasty and fresh."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2018-11-14,4.0,I go here nearly everyday because I work near by. I am not a huge fan of chain coffee shops-- especially Starbucks-- however I am a fan of Greg's. Their coffee is delicious but I typically get chais or mochas. The baristas are diligent and while it may take a tad more time to get your drink it is work it. This location has a good amount of seating and tends to be fairly quiet.
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2017-04-29,4.0,"With so many cafe options in the city, it's really not too difficult to find a good cup of joe. Nevertheless, I often like to venture out and try new places whenever I can. Having walked passed Gregory's a number of times, I finally decided to step through the front doors and try it out for myself. Overall, I was pretty impressed with this place. The prices are a little steep, but nothing steeper than you would encounter at a similar premium coffee shop.

As with most eclectic coffee places, I generally like to try a signature drink and a pastry to really get the full experience. At Gregory's I opted for an Amaca (Columbian coffee press with chocolate, baking spice, and clean grapefruit tasting notes) and a chocolate wafer. The coffee was definitely as I had hoped: robust, flavorful, and smooth (no burned or overly bitter taste). It's the type of coffee that you could drink with or without milk or sugar, which is always a positive in my book! As for the chocolate wafer? It was awesome! About the size of a large cookie, it was chewy and sweet with just the right amount of dark chocolate. I would almost come back here just for that, but then again, I do have an impartial sweet tooth.

Aside from the items that I ordered, Gregory's coffee also offers an array of drip and blend coffees, espressos, cappuccinos, iced drinks, teas and more. Most drinks are offered in small, medium or large, although the signature beverages (such as the Amaca) are one-size only. The store also offers an array of pastries (muffins, cookies, brownies, croissants, etc.) and even some merchandise for those who really love this brand.

Service here is also very good. The staff is quick and friendly (the former quality is especially important in midtown), and the employees have a good understanding of the coffee they serve.

Overall, I was very happy with my visit here. While it is a bit out of my way, I would certainly consider stopping by again for another premium cup of joe!"
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-07-11,4.0,"The quality of the coffee is excellent here and seating is usually available. That said, the din of the crowd is fairly high so speaking on the phone and conducting business here as a remote office is challenging. Service is quick enough although I ran into an impatient barista on my last visit who did a great job advancing NY's reputation for rude chic. Still I'll be back despite these negatives because I'm looking for a decent cup of coffee and this place delivers in abundance."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-07-06,2.0,"The drinks and ambiance were nice but after my friend and I were seated, one of the baristas knocked over some coffee lids onto the floor, and after I handed them back to her she put them back on the top of the stack for use. Disgusting."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-02-26,1.0,"Words can't describe how horrible this place is. The manager is rude and the staff wasn't much better. When I asked for chocolate to finish off my cappuccino (as per traditional and global way of serving a cappuccino) they point blank told me I was wrong and that wasn't how cappuccino's are served. First of all I was CORRECT... but even if I wasn't, you don't treat customers that way. 

They also closed the bathrooms 20 minutes before closing, and his place has no less than 5 very agitated customers in the 3 minutes I was there."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2018-05-03,4.0,"Hipster-esque coffee shops are a dime a dozen in this city, so I was super ready to hate Gregory's, with their recognizable-yet-cool logo--glasses made of coffee cups, with spiky hair just screams, ""I'm extremely trendy and on brand!""  However.  The coffee was absolutely delicious!  There was a tangy, chocolately undertone to the cold brew which was surprisingly rich and enjoyable.  

That being said, I was a little frustrated by my experience in-store--I ordered a cold brew and a pastry, and after I paid, the barista ducked down and pulled the cookie from a bin below, rather than from the display case.  Maybe it was to ensure the cookie was fresh, rather than stale from sitting in the open, but it felt really weird, especially since at first she said that they were out of the pastry I'd ordered when, yanno, I could literally see them Right There.

Then, when I went over to wait for my cold brew as directed, the gentleman after me got his cold brew and I stood there waiting while the baristas chatted--I had to return to the (different) cashier who tried to take a new order until I explained I was still waiting for my drink.  

I didn't think the cookie was anything special--had a strange aftertaste I didn't enjoy, but it was fresh and I can't say it's the cookie and not my strange palate. The coffee was good enough for me to ignore my pastry/service issues, but it's something I'll keep an eye on in the future."

The nicest staff anywhere in the city.   No kidding.  I arrived after midnight and was disoriented the next morning.  The girls that run the Gregory's Shop on the weekends were so kind and wonderful.   Made myself and  my whole family feel like we were right at home all week.
The coffee is great, try the honey badger, but stop by to feel welcomed by a great staff for a morning wakeup."

If you have the time, the spicy avo toast is great but avoid the vegan breakfast sandwich like the plague - more basil in one bite of that thing than any one human could eat in a lifetime (it is not edible - please change the bread on that awful thing). 
I have only frequented the location on 31st and 6th so service may be quicker at other locations but I suspect the horrible bread used on the vegan sandwich is at all locations.  Do yourself a favor and make a different food selection.  Most everything else on the menu is great."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2019-06-15,5.0,Great coffee. Love their oat milk and cold brew. Gregory himself is very kind and helpful as well.
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2018-12-14,2.0,"I am a regular customer of Gregory's Coffee located at 12 East 46th Street,
NYC. I ordered for the first time Avocado Toast, which is one of my favorites. In advance I could have never been convinced it wouldn't be delicious. However, I was very disappointed. The avocado spread was sparse, somewhat tasteless and entirely too much Red Pepper Flakes. 
Upon returning, I first expressed my experience with a Counter Server and then with a young man who's posture demonstrated a senior post.
The response I received from this young man was ""I love the Avocado Toast."" The cost for one (1) slice of Avocado Toast is $7.00 which at best should be enjoyed.
This response was offensive and definitely does not demonstrate business sense or customer care. This young man has changed my perception of Gregory's Coffee and I only purchase from this vendor if I have no choice.

Respectfully submitted,
Dissatisfied Customer"
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2018-11-20,3.0,"Food: tried chocolate banana muffin, which is really DRY! The chocolate chunks inside are delicious though. They do have a lot of baked goods options with a chocolate flavor. 

Drink: For coffee, I usually just have Americano and it has a very standard taste. Heard that Greg's smoothies is actually a solid choice. definitely give it a try next time. 

Environment: personally I like this location better than the one close to our school. This shop has way more seatings, free wifi, and ice water. It could be very crowded in the afternoon time though."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2018-09-26,5.0,Excellent. I had the matcha latte with almond milk. Perfect. Also the gluten free dark chocolate cookie was divine. I will have to try all the other latte options. I will be back everyday!

Service was great. Greeted upon entering and very friendly. Staff was very attentive to the customers. Coffee was a dostinct flavor ive never had before. Delicious"
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2017-11-12,3.0,"Good, not great coffee, but better than Starbucks!

Got the regular drip coffee - solid 3 Star, no sour aftertaste as you would find in a place that doesn't clean out its remnants

Dirty chai: 3 stars, needed more spice to counter the shot of espresso, but still better than some chai's I've had.

Would come back if it is easy to get to, and I need caffeine as I am passing by"
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2017-05-18,4.0,"I went there early this afternoon.  The positive points:  All three employees were very friendly, there's a decent amount of seating (which is somewhat of a luxury for Midtown) and it was clean (including the restroom).  The negative points:  the music was too loud - although not nearly as loud as at their East 40th Street location, where it was really intolerable the time I went there - and the coffee was just ""fair"" (I got a small/regular cup [$2.40]).

I'd prefer to give 3.5 stars, but it's closer to 4 than to 3...."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2015-12-16,3.0,"For those great reviews, all I need to ask is why? and how?
I came here during lunch time and there was a short line in front me. I felt grateful. Why? Cuz all those bakeries on the counter were staring at me and asked me to take them and leave. I knew! I knew. Finally, I did. I picked Cinnamon explode. I was like, YAH, EXPLODE.

And my heart explode when I got my first bite. It was horrible. It was dry, and tasted like chocolate. And the amount of chocolate inside is like minimum.
ARE YOU REALLY SERIOUSLY KIDDING ME?

I am hugely disappointed and basically I won't come back.
I mean, maybe the timing is not right but don't they know that bakeries are tasting s*t if they are not properly reserved? Ugh

Ugh
UGH"
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2018-07-30,3.0,"The coffee here is 'just fine'. I think they're filling the gap between Starbucks and say Little Collins or Blue Bottle who are the real deal..They're not near as bad as Starbucks but nowhere near Little Collins, Ground Central, Blue Bottle etc

Like if you go to Little Collins you'd get an actual Flat White, where as here you'll get a blank look from the cashier and then they'll go ahead and make a latte for you. 

Flat white should have much less mild than a Cap or Latte in my opinion."
1004,gregorys-coffee-new-york-4,2018-02-15,4.0,"I've only been here once during a visit, but it was a nice place to start our morning right.
Good hot coffee, and the donuts we had were tasty and filling. Don't know much about the chain itself, but if I lived around the area I'd probably frequent them quite a bit."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2019-07-26,5.0,"This is a beautiful serene public space with plenty of seating, be it patio or bench style. There is a bar inside, information station and SPO onsite as this space is maintained by Lincoln Center et al.
The pièce de résistance are the living walls that flank each entrance. This living wall has trees.....TREES! It is quite beautiful. If you are a lover of plants and interior green spaces, this one ranks very high on my list. 
So if you need a quiet space to work, a zen space to just 'woosah' or an appropriately climated space to escape the heat or cold of outdoors, this place is for you."

Free evening concerts weekly.  In the know, you'd arrive early, 1-1/2hours before, grab a drink and seat.  If can't, be prepared to wait in line with no good outcome of anyone leaving so you can get in.

CHEERS!"
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2018-03-16,4.0,"I've known about this atrium for quite a while but for some reason, just never went there!  They have a TDF TKTS booth there!  This is great for anyone looking to buy discounted Broadway shows on the day of the performance.  The TKTS booth at Times Square usually has an extremely long, slow line, so it's worth it to trek over to the David Rubenstein Atrium to get your tkts....absolutely no lines here!

The Atrium also offers FREE weekly live show!  First come, first served!  My advice is to come early to get a seat....heck, come early to make sure you get in!  This Atrium is smallish and has limited capacity.  They literally take a headcount, and then shut the doors once they've reached capacity.  A line starts to form outside for those who gets shut out of the show, in hopes that people will leave before the end of the show.  Those on line cannot enter until someone leaves. Bring some food/drinks and enjoy them while you wait for the show to begin.  Discreet alcohol seems to be ok.  I saw lots of people with bottles of beer and wine.  

Check out their Event Lineup:  http://atrium.lincolncenter.org/index.php/free-performances

Tonight, I was lucky enough to see Eddie Palmieri! www.lincolncenter.org/show/vaya-63-eddie-palmieri 
What a great show!  There were two sets; lasting about two hours.  Two hours of incredible music and dancing!  Everyone was up on their feet the minute the music started...even the seniors!  A fantastic time was had by all! 

I would definitely come back to the Atrium to see other free shows.  So sorry that I missed Tito Puente Jr last week!"
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2018-12-12,5.0,"Five stars to an atrium might seem CRAZY! And I guess it goes against of my scale a bit of 5-star spots being MUST DOs for people visiting, but relative to the category of places to work, this place deserves all of its 5-stars. If you're looking for a place to hang out and get some work done, this is the spot.

First, it's big with lots of places to sit. Second, the wifi speeds are fantastic. I'm pretty sure there are outlets, too, if you sit along the wall. Third, there are bathrooms and they are easy to get to and without lines. And finally, you have everything you need to keep you going while you work - food, coffee, and beer.

Again, maybe don't go out of your way if you're looking for a magnificent meal or the greatest cup of coffee, but finding a spot to get some work done can be hard... shitty wifi, no place to sit, etc... but this place is great for such activity!"
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2018-01-12,5.0,"The David Rubinstein Atrium has weekly, every Thursday year round a program of Free Performing Arts.

I had visited recently on two occasion for Raga Cubana, a fusion of Afro-Cuban and Indian music that was superb. Román Diaz & Melvis Santa with Brooklyn Raga Massive united their talents for a night of mystical sounds.

Last night Changüi Majadero, an East LA group of mixed nationalities came together playing Cuban music.Gabriel Garcia, is the band leader, vocalist and Tres player. Great music making.

The programs are varied and there is opportunity for every taste. Classical Chamber music, spoken word, hip-hop, etc.

On the first show the Bar/Café was open. On a very cold night Herbal Hot Tea was delightful. Last night it was closed. I have to check hours of operation.

Check the list of performances at their website.
One will no be disappointed at the level of performances presented at the Atrium."

The mid-day rush dies out around 2PM. An ideal place to get some remote work done, whether you're keeping warm during harsh winters, or in need of a great escape from the Central Park / Lincoln Center summer madness."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2016-03-27,4.0,"It's very nice to have this area to rest and sit without having to purchase anything. It's a nice environment with plenty of seating and artistic greenery. The crowd here is mixed, ranging from young professionals working on their laptops to the indigent. However, no one seems to be bothering anyone else. It's great if you're waiting to see a concert at Lincoln Center or just looking to kill time before your next commitment. 

Be aware that somethings this place is closed due to special private events."

There was plenty of room to dance and the crowd was diverse: Old people dancing with walkers right next to little kids rockin' out :-) Bright, airy, not stuffy. Good vibes all around. Definitely check out their evening programs."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2019-01-24,4.0,"Great, inviting space with tables & chairs, fair amount of outlets for charging devices, Coffeed counter, although kind of pricey, is a good spot to get coffee, breakfast, lunch, snacks, etc., bathrooms, TKTS and weekly free performances.  Negative, and it's a big one, are the homeless.  I feel for their circumstances however most smell, have bags and bags of belongings, seem to get carte Blanche to just sit.  Plus there is one guy who is obviously masturbating through his pants and is there every time I'm there (3 x per week) so I think it's safe to assume that security turns a blind eye.  Removing one star for that.  Hard to believe Lincoln Center would allow this behavior."

I didn't sit close to the green wall, so it was quite industrial-feeling, but I didn't mind.  I was there for productivity, not to get distracted by ambiance.

Free wifi, public restroom, plenty of seating, friendly staff, and close to the Columbus Circle trains.  There was a 'wichcraft, although it looked like it was closing when I arrived.  No fret; I had my own snacks with me.

There was work to be done, and this girl got stuff done.  So happy to have found this place!"

1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2013-09-09,4.0,"This review is for the concert series on Target free Thursday.

I came here last Thursday with my friend to see the Juilliard Jazz ensemble. I had never been to the David Rubenstein atrium before. The space was very large with high ceilings and the wall of vertical foliage was very interesting and provided a nice contrast to the modern design of the rest of the building. There is a Wichcraft inside that serves a variety of food and drinks including a couple of beer taps.

If you are coming here on Thursdays to see a concert, I would highly recommend getting here by 6:30PM to get decent seats for the 7:30PM concert. I got here at 6:30 PM and most of the good seats had been taken. I was able to find a seat in the back and saved one for my friend who got here 15 minutes later. Even within those 15 minutes I had a number of people come up to me to ask me for my free seat. Needless to say, a lot of people come here on Thursdays to see these free concerts. By the time the concert had started, there was a hoard of people outside the doors listening in.

The concert itself was amazing. The Juilliard Jazz ensemble that night played a set list entitled New Orleans: Then and Now. They started with a few oldies and finished with a couple of contemporary pieces. The musicians were all virtuosos and so young!

I can't wait to come back another Thursday to check out some other cool performances. Events like this are one of the major perks of living in New York city."

- Free fast Wi-Fi

- If you're coming for free Thursdays, arrival by 7 should ensure yourself a seat"
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2017-07-08,4.0,"A great and relaxing place to see a free concert! Depending on the popularity of the artist, you should come earlier so you can grab a seat. I saw the Korean folk band Coreyah here."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2016-03-30,5.0,This is a beautiful atrium. I came here to grab a coffee while I was near by and was so pleased when I saw this atrium. It's peaceful with a lovely fountain that also has an art installation above it. There are 2 walls with plants on them that help dampen noise and bring a lovely fresh and earthy feel to the space. There is plenty of seating and bathrooms for public use that are clean!
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2018-09-08,3.0,"This is based on weekend visits only so other visitors' experiences may differ from mine. It's a nice space with tables and chairs, clean for the most part (bathrooms were hit or miss), outlets for charging, nice greenery and murals. Has been fairly quiet (exception coming up) even with lines for Tkts. Negatives are the homeless, security which really doesn't do anything with the unpleasant homeless people (foul language, taking over large spaces, hogging outlets) except stare from behind the desk, what seems to be a concession stand has never been open when I've been there. Seriously, this could get another star without the homeless."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2017-08-02,4.0,"Beautiful atrium with lots of tables, water, stunning plant wall and a few wall outlets for charging. Only downside was I didn't see a water fountain or a restroom."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2015-12-20,4.0,"Dragged my study buddy here on a Saturday morning (okay 11am....) in December.  We'd effectively been kicked out by every Starbucks and coffee shop in town, since spots in the city are taken by 7am! :(   I did a quick Google search on ""secret study spots in the City"" and came upon the David Rubenstein Atrium. 

We went inside and were so pleasantly surprised not only at the amount of tables and space still available !!  Important to note, though, is that this place is not by any means quiet.  While we were there, there was a children's birthday party, friends and family catching up, students studying--a total gamut.  

That being said, we set up shop, plugged in our headphones and was totally fine! Outlets here are coveted--especially in the winter--where there are only two or three outlets in the actual atrium and then another four or five in the outer corners on the stone benches (which: 1. have homeless people sleeping on them and 2. are cold as all heck!)

My buddy was hungry and took advantage of the sandwich shop inside which was amaze! 



TL;DR version""

Great place to study! Free wifi but no plugs. Make sure to charge up beforehand.  Also limited seating--but there is a sandwich store within as well!"
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2015-08-09,5.0,"What's not to like? Amazing space to get work done.

- The atrium is amazing - with tall ceilings that aren't really captured in the photos.
- Coffee is accessible/plentiful both inside the atrium and in the neighborhood.
- Wi Fi and air conditioning is strong.
- Tables, seating, and bathrooms are well-maintained and plentiful.
- Beautiful music plays in the background."

1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2010-11-21,4.0,"Oh man, my iPhone is running out of juice. I am ashamed of the codependency that I have developed with my iPhone. I admit it. I have no personality outside of my iPhone. The moment I am disconnected from the world according to my iPhone, I cease to exist. I become one of those people who actually start conversations and give real eye contact. Sounds awful. Alas, the David Rubinstein Atrium has plenty of outlets, several underneath the cement slabs that serve as seating there. 

What a joy to see such an oasis in the middle of urbania. It serves as a starting point for the tours of Lincoln Center. But the atrium offers more than outlets and tour groups. It features these two amazing vertical gardens with all sorts of green foliage to admire on the walls. There's also a floor-to-ceiling fountain and a media wall that not only provides comprehensive performance information but also a blank canvas for original video presentations. There are lots of tables - all occupied, of course - and free WiFi that make this a laptopper's wet dream of a hangout.

But there are also solitary benches to ponder life and watch your iPhone battery image go from red to green. There's also an information desk, a clean restroom (just one!) and free weekly musical performances by local artists on Target Free Thursdays at 8:30PM. You can also pick up a sandwich, salad or a cup of joe at the adjacent 'wichcraft inside. OK, I am recharged. I am whole again. Besides, it's just a nice break from all the traffic noise on Columbus."

There's free wifi, seating, and a clean atmosphere - all for free.  There will be bustling, of course, and sometimes it can be difficult to find a seat.  But, it is a free space in an otherwise congested and populated area.   I come here to work whenever I don't feel like going into the library - especially since I can relax a little more and not feel judged by looking at Twitter the whole time.

Also, you can bring food into the space - there's a cafe there, but they don't have the power over the tables.  Bring snacks and take a load off!"

They have a cool stage here, which had a jazz setup when I visited, and host many events, which I have not yet explored, but there is a little chain cafe where you can grab a sandwich, soup, salad, or even a table wine.

The vertical patch of grass on the wall is kind of cool, too."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2013-05-18,5.0,"I was meeting some friends at the Starbucks on the corner, and as usual, it was overflowing with people.  So we wandered in here on a whim.  We ordered coffee because it is awkward to go somewhere to hang out without buying anything.  Haha.  It was cheap and good, and we got to socialize so it worked for us.  The space is very serene and cool, and I will definitely continue to meet people here.  Plus one bonus star for the fountain.

I am all about free large spaces with free wifi, and thank you to the David Rubenstein Atrium for doing so.  My ONLY complaint is that single people camp out here all day and take up the tables so it can be really hard to find somewhere to sit."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2016-10-27,5.0,"Um, this place was empty after work hours. I went to the Starbucks next door first to grab a drink (their Wichcraft station looked meh) and was really glad to escape that crowded, unpleasant space for this oasis.

I found out about this place through someone I met at a networking event. She knew I was always on the lookout for new and cool venues around the city so she invited me to check out the Atrium. She works there and was able to reserve seats. Good thing since the place does fill up. 

It's a lovely space. Very open, high ceilings, and there's grass growing on the wall!!! To get back to the ceiling, what I assumed  were lights on the ceilings were in fact openings that allow you to see outside. The space can be rented out for private events. It's huge so I imagine you would need a minimum of 100 people to make it worth it. 

For Target Free Thursdays the Atrium has free performances. The night I went, they had Sanford Biggers: Moon Medicin. Never heard of them, but thank you TFT for introducing me to them. It was an unbelievable performance and quite the experience. It was music, performance, history and art rolled into one. I laughed, I danced, and I cringed (very provocative imagery). I've been googling the group and some of the video compilations since. I can't get enough. I seriously loved everything about this performance. If other performances for TFT are anything like this, I definitely need to make time to go."

Great place to work. Free wifi is wonderful. Close to subways, easy to get a cab"
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2016-08-16,3.0,"3.5 stars. There are a lot of tables, free wifi and outlets, so this is a good venue for light reading or resting/chatting with friends. The noise level tends to get fairly high, so I wouldn't recommend it for studying. There is a 'wichcraft stand where you can purchase food and beverages, although their ice coffee was one of the most diluted and tasteless coffee I've ever bought - I recommend that you stop by Starbucks next door beforehand if you want something to eat/drink here."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2013-12-30,5.0,"My boyfriend recommended this place after 4 friends and I found ourselves looking for a place to chat business. This place is amazing. Clean , cozy, quiet. Free WiFi and very convenient. It is now our go to meeting spot. 

Great for groups of 5 or smaller to meet on a weekend. We went on a Sunday since the Wix lounge was closed and while all tables were taken it didn't feel crowded. Staff was nice. Ordered a soup from the Witch craft. It sufficed. 

This is now my go to spot."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2013-08-01,4.0,"This place seems to fly under the average NYC tourist's radar.  Although Lincoln Center tour groups occasionally meet up here, they do not stick around for long.  The vastness of the space itself allows for both socialization and concentration.  

If you are looking for a place to get some work done, the free wifi, mellow Jazz, and close by supply of reasonably priced coffee make it easy.  I have limited experience with their food selection, but I can tell you with certainty that their banana walnut bread is top notch.  

Bringing your own food and drink here is not frowned upon.  This is also a rare quality for any place in Manhattan that does not go unappreciated.

There are a few negative aspects that may seem negligible, but I will mention them here in the name of science.

There is a strangely civil battle constantly being waged for access to one of the few outlets.  Because so many people use their laptops here, the tables up against the projector screen/wall are prime real estate because most plugs are located there.  

Another thing to keep in mind is that the tables located in the middle are often reserved for private events at random times throughout the day.  The staff is very polite about this, but it can be annoying if you do not plan ahead.

Overall, I am very grateful that this place exists.  It is a great place to hide away from the noise and chaos of the city."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2015-09-24,4.0,"This is one of my go to writing spots. Especially in the summer when I need to get some AC. Even when it's crowded, I always find a seat. And I love the living plant walls!"
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2014-05-11,4.0,"Large, vast space similar to the large atrium in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. that sits right by Lincoln Center. If you're looking for a relatively quiet meeting place or study space and have nowhere else to turn to, I'd recommend checking this place out. 

They have free, fast wifi and sandwiches/coffee/breakfast foods provided by 'Wichcraft. 

I will say that it smells like old people though...so... yea."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2013-01-24,5.0,"If you had seen this place before the renovation, you'd think you died and gone to heaven.

The decor and ambiance of the place is inviting and warm, and the wifi signal is strong with outlets a plenty. The David Rubinstein Atrium is THE spot to catch a bite to eat, to peruse the discount box office for shows (sad to see War Horse leave), and to stay warm in style. Not to mention that every Thursday they have FREE performances that change every week. 

It is my favorite place to hang out in the UWS and def one of the top, FREE indoor spaces in the city."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2014-04-25,4.0,"I've been here a few times for their AtriumFlix screenings and, surprisingly, it's a great space for a movie. Who knew?! They project the film onto the large wall, the seats are relatively comfortable, and the acoustics are just fine. 

One drawback is that you have to use the elevator for the bathrooms. Seriously sucks when everyone needs to go at the end of the movie so you get a queue for the elevator AND a queue for the bathroom. But, if emptying your bladder in the middle of the film or when you get home is your deal then there's no drawback for you."
1005,david-rubenstein-atrium-new-york,2016-05-11,4.0,"A really nice public space to just decompress and get away from the crowds in this area. Get some coffee or snacks or lunch at the counter, but no pressure to."
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-04-27,5.0,"Good coffee, friendly service and the pistachio croissant is awesome.  They don't make them there, but wherever they get them from, they aced it.

Check this place out when you're in the 40's on the east side (I am in the area a lot, so it works great for me).  Use the app and get a big discount.  $2 coffee.  You can't go wrong."
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-04-28,4.0,"My bf ordered me coffee from this place as it's close to our jobs and I had seen the space setup and the advertisement for inexpensive coffee.  

It's important to note though you need a app to order and you prepay monthly I believe each month a few, but in exchange everything is $2.  I've tried the Matcha Latte and Mocha.  They were both good however, I prefer the Matcha Latte more.  The coffee was strong and I like the layout of the place, but it's more about the experience than the coffee itself.  I liked my visit though because they also featured a fashion startup in the rented space.  Worth giving the place a try."
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-03-16,2.0,"Bandit is close to my office, and I convinced my co workers that we should go outside our comfort zone to try Bandit coffee. I've seen the advertisements for it being $2, I thought it was a good deal. 

Fun fact: it's only $2 when you have the app. 

My coffee was almost $7 and nothing special. 

If you do go, download the app beforehand, unfortunately I was not told this about the app until after I already paid."
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2019-12-03,4.0,"Well I pass this place and I see a coffee shop inside what looks like an unfinished demolition store space.
 
Rent must be cheap I say, and they have bandit as their name , $2 coffee is the game.
 
But wait you can't play unless you get there app, because not only is it no cash-o-la here, but no card-o-la too. No app then no coffee but the first one is free.
 
Unlike Matto Espresso with the $2 price on everything , here you need there app to order, they don't even have a kiosk in the store.
 
Also the $2 is for regular cup if you want latte you pay up.  I think they really want to do small like pop up shops like at airports, and hotels and not store fronts.
 
Well I downloaded the App and I was about to register but then I said what's the point ?"
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-03-02,5.0,Great coffee & even greater service! Super cute industrial look that is perfect for NYC!
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2019-12-06,4.0,"Came to Bandit for the first time because there was a promotion when the shop opened. It's located on the first floor of a semi-finished, warehouse-like space. The shop itself is both cashless and cardless; they only accept mobile orders within their app. 

I really enjoyed The Grinch seasonal special, which they were able to make hot (even though it's listed as a cold drink). It's a honey lavender matcha latte with a sprinkling of crispy coconut flakes. It exceeded my expectations because it wasn't overly sweet and had a consistent (non-powdery) texture. It's definitely one of the better matcha lattes I've had in the Midtown area and I highly recommend it for any non-coffee drinkers who need their caffeine fix!"
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2019-09-11,4.0,"As of today, their hours are 7:30am-5pm M-F btw 

Great drinks - limited menu (not a full cafe with cortados etc) but what they have is excellent. Most notable is probably their matcha which is generally a high risk order bc it's expensive and rarely done correctly. Though their matcha is a bit powdery at the bottom, the flavor comes through well

Also a huge fan of their business model where all(?) of their drinks are on tap and you must order through their app (search for coffee bandit app). Talk about high profit margins while being super efficient! I love being able to order a block away and pick up immediately when I walk in"
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-02-27,5.0,"Awesome concept (save by ordering on the mobile app vs. kios in store), very friendly staff (always great enthusiasm, very customer-first mentality and welcoming), and the coffee is top notch especially for the price.

 Also, the wait for your order is minimal in comparison to other coffee spots and they partner with other companies for some of their food offerings & specials. You can even purchase bags of coffee for home use!

And can't forget the lively space (does look unfinished but goes with the NYC vibe) with music and room to expand with other options for the space."
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2019-07-31,5.0,"Coffee was great and service was even better. Really unique concept that requires all orders to be requested via their mobile app. So there is no cash register!?

Pretty simple though... I downloaded on my phone and cold brew was ready in two minutes. Try them!! Now I'm hooked!"
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2019-12-26,4.0,It's a chill place that has a lot of space to do meetings or get some work done. The staff is friendly and quick at fulfilling orders. Only not so great aspect is having to go next door and up the escalators to use the bathroom.
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-02-26,5.0,"Fast and easy to get my coffee in the morning. It's right below my office, so I just order ahead and grab my coffee on the way up. It's $2 for coffee, cheaper than starbucks!"
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-02-28,5.0,Love the concept and the different promotions! Def an innovative idea. The selection of drinks are also
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-02-18,4.0,Good coffee that's fast and easy. Ordering through the app makes it convenient because your coffee is usually waiting there within a few minutes. Flavors are basic with some specials. Can't beat the prices.
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-03-05,5.0,"Cold brew was on spot and cappuccino with oatmilk was also very good. They have oatly! 
Have been to this location several times already and it is always quick and spacious with friendly staff. 
Can't wait to go back and try their pastry next time!"
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-03-05,5.0,"Amazing coffee shop in industrial space in Midtown!! Very cool art on display and great coffee 
Insider tip : download the app for special discounts"
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2019-12-31,4.0,"cool concept with mobile only ordering. decent coffee for relatively decent prices (vs say starbucks). you don't get the full coffee house experience so it's more of a grab and go type of place even though they have seating. had the raspberry donut, but it seemed that it could be fresher for $3 and it's relatively small. but I did score a $1 promo matcha latte which was cool. looks like they will keep enticing you with mobile offers and you can do a $1 a day coffee subscription with monthly pre-pay."
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-02-27,5.0,"In a competitive coffee market, bandit stands out with efficiency, price and quality product. It's everything you need to get through a stressful NY morning."
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-02-27,5.0,"Best, fastest, and cheapest coffee in this area. Bandit is definitely my go-to coffee when I'm at work."
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-02-27,5.0,"I love this cafe.. awesome concept. It really stands out from the rest. The coffee is yummy and cheap in a nice environment. They also have a lot of flavors like matcha latte, etc! Go check em out!"
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-02-05,1.0,"They are flooding our building with coupons for $2 coffee beverages. But I walked in and was charged $4.90 for a ""meh"" cappuccino. And then was handed a coupon on the way out again for $2 beverages! I walked back in to complain, they told me to get beverages for $2 you have to download the app. I personally don't want to sign up for an app and get bombarded with offers for overpriced, average coffee in truly the world's ugliest space (is there asbestos hanging from the ceilings? could be!). AVOID!"
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2019-10-15,1.0,"I ordered a cup of coffee this morning via Bandit app. In a few minutes, I came to the location to pick it up. However NOBODY was there. I mean no server/representative was there.  The store was empty. I waited there for 5 minutes but nobody still showed up. I left a memo to ask them to cancel my order but the App says ""your order is ready to pick up.""  Please give me back my money.  I cannot believe NO one is there to serve coffee in the busiest time of a day for a coffee shop???  

I came back to Bandit to ask them to give me back my money.  A server (a young girl) was there and she said she was told by her boss to go to their other location to deliver coffee.  Really?!?!  If they had sent her to the other location, they could have turned off their App so that no one would have ordered anything.  Obviously they do NOT care about their customers.  I will NEVER go back."
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-03-07,3.0,I liked that concept or design and idea but more importantly coffee tastes mediocre. I gave them three chances with diff coffee. Each coffee earned each star so three stars in total.
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2019-12-16,5.0,Yay for bandit! Met the folks at my 205 Hudson WeWork and have been an advocate since then! Best prices in NYC for QUALITY
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-02-26,4.0,"You can't beat the price -- nice $2 latte and lots of space, no wait at 9:30 am. Get the app and enjoy! Croissants were fresh and tasty."
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-01-17,5.0,"Good, super efficient coffee and a great event venue! Clean and spacious compared to most coffee shops in the city. It's a hidden gem!"
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2020-02-13,1.0,"Too hip for its own good. You have to order from a single iPad or download their app to just buy coffee. It's like waiting in line for a metro card. I just sat there for a half hour watching people just struggle and get annoyed by the whole experience. EveDUDE, people need to get to work! Also, isn't illegal in nyc to not accept cash?"
1006,bandit-new-york-6,2019-09-24,5.0,"This place makes a fantastic matcha latte! Best one I've found in NYC and for a decent price. The people who work here are extremely nice and I'll definitely be returning :) To order from the store located in the atrium of 120 park, you must order ahead of time on an app, and your drink comes out so much quicker that way. One of the baristas mentioned the store has only been there for about a month, so support their business and give them a try!"
1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2020-02-06,5.0,"This coffee shop is spectacular... This place deserves to be 5 stars all the way thru but I kind of want it not to be so popular! The coffee options are everything that you expect with milk alternatives... The pastries are to die for! Amazing selection of tarts, cakes, croissant, pan au chocolate... Etc! I've had the ham and cheese on a roll as well as the prosciutto and fresh mozzarella sandwich!"
1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2019-06-02,4.0,"I had the San Ambroeus, which was a bit too sweet for me at the beginning (most American deserts are too sweet to my Asian palate). Yet after the first bite, I felt the chocolate mousse integrated with the chocolate custard on the tip of my tongue, then the crunchy chocolate crust hit, after which all ingredients melted inside my mouth with layers of flavors and various textures lingering - how amazing. 

Would recommend this to anyone who loves sweet desserts. For those who are not great at dealing with sweetness, try order an iced tea to go with this cake."
1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2019-09-20,2.0,"Nothing but problems here. 
Coffee is burnt. If I wanted burnt coffee, I'd go to Starbucks. It's salvaged by very creamy milk, but if i hadn't ordered a latte, it would be undrinkable. 
They sell pastries called ""cornetto"" but which sure look like pain au chocolat. Unfortunately, they do not taste like pain au chocolat, and I binned the pastry bc it is nasty. 
To top it all off, for a 12oz burnt latte and an inedible pastry, I paid $10. That's a lot for what I got. 
People were nice, venue was beautiful, but that doesn't make up for gross food and drink."
1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2018-04-29,5.0,"Sant Ambreous is a cool little UES spot whose modern styling and beautiful baked goods will draw you right in. 

My favorite here is their salmone croissant, a freshly baked light-and-airy seeded crossiant with a generous amount of smoked salmon that's so good, I had it two days in a row!  Pair it with their full-bodied and balanced dark roast for a light, delicious breakfast. 

While you're here, try out there amazing flourless chocolate chunk cookies. I normally equate the words 'flourless chocolate' with 'dense', but these cookies were anything but - airy, chewy, chocolatey, scrumptious!

I'd suggest you sit outside if it's a nice day, as the indoor counters are a bit high and the stools a bit low for comfort. That aside, this paninoteca/pasticceria, along with it's friendly staff, makes for a nice way to start your morning."
1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2018-11-19,5.0,"Have you ever eaten something mindlessly only to stop and look at it angrily in disbelief when you realize it actually tastes good? That's how I felt eating their Apricot Cornetto (ie croissant). I don't even really like apricot, but this thing is good. 

Not only that, their tiny prosciutto parma sandwiches are the perfect in between meal snack. I'm used to having a prosciutto sandwich that has good meat, but lousy bread, but every piece of this thing was perfect. I could probably eat 3 of them and I'm sad that they don't have this Coffee Bar at the Loews in Los Angeles so I can. If you're looking for a quick but delicious snack on the way to something, head here. 

PS. This place isn't located in the hotel, but around the corner facing the 61st Street."
1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2018-03-14,5.0,"I absolutely loved the iced latte that they served in a wine glass.  Unfortunately they were sold out of their seasonal cheesecake so I settled for a brioche bun.  I also bought two mini cakes and had them later.  The clientele who come here reflect the area.  It was fun people watching.  An elderly woman who was a cross between Joan Didion and Joan Rivers with her huge black cat eyed sunglasses and her vintage Chanel bag oohed and ahhed at the display section as her two friends looked on annoyed impatience.  

The service at the front was excellent, but one of the girls in the back making the drinks looked miserable.  Even though it was windy many of the patrons sat outside as there is limited seating inside.  I sat outside and people watched as I drank my excellent iced latte.  When I got up after finishing my drink and pastry another elderly lady with bright red lipstick passed by clenching her cane, but what really stood out was her magnificent fur coat and perfectly coiffed hair.  I gotta hand it to this place-- I was pretty amused watching all sorts of intriguing people walk by.  I hope I'm glamorous as these old ladies when I hit their age.  Haha.  I'll definitely be back and plan to visit their other locations."

We waited in a short line and received good service throughout. Waited a reasonable amount of time for our machiattos, which were prepared well. We stood at the window counter and quickly ate and drank - not the kind of spot that you can really linger. Everything was very good - especially the apricot cornetto (croissant). Wish they had a water station, but they hooked me up when I asked. Overall a great spot for a (very) quick bite and breakfast/coffee to start your day."

1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2018-12-29,5.0,"We came here in the most time, Christmas Eve, in search of outside seating that was heated, coffee to warm us up, and a bite to eat. Check check check! Entrance set off of Park Ave and attached to a hotel, people watching was pretty prime. They had more outside seating than inside, and each table had a heat lamp on it. Well, not the first table right in front of it, strange.

Yes, it's pricey (~$10 for a slider style sandwich), but it is near Central Park so location location location. Is this a place to bring a date? Only if your site outside. There is just enough privacy to dish out your best game. I would not bring a large group here though, it is quite small."
1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2019-06-25,3.0,$5 for a coffee is ok but I'd expect pleasant service. They were rushed with very small line. Coffee was fine not great. Outside seating which is nice. Inside standing only - at bars. To be fair - the rude New Yorkers in front of me may have put service team in a foul mood. But they need to get used to rude New Yorkers (even though I haven't).
1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2019-07-13,3.0,Very watery and bitter coffee but maybe worth it for the nice area and outdoor seating on a summer day. Cool how they serve coffee in wine glasses but they should fix the coffee itself.
1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2018-04-26,5.0,"Consistently good place for a small sandwich or croissant, and a cup of tea or coffee. I once had a frittata sandwich here that was so good that I spent the next day trying to make a frittata on my own to replicate the sandwich. They have other good small sandwiches also with nice ingredients like prosciutto, and then your more basic tuna, egg salad, etc. When I was here with my daughter she ordered an apple tart which she really enjoyed."

1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2018-07-05,5.0,"Possibly my favourite coffee bar and lunch/dessert spot in the whole of NYC. I love that you can truly feel like you're in Milan, people-watching, and the little sandwiches + salads are divine. It's also close to work and you don't waste time waiting on food.

I love their prosciutto cotto - the bread and prosciutto simply melt in your mouth. Good prosciutto is an indication that the rest of the food will be nice! I don't know where to begin - their salads, everything I've tried is lovely. Coffees, gelato, desserts - you really can't go wrong. Absolutely gorgeous food and I love sitting outside."

However this place was way too touristy that the line simply did not move in busy times, as it is very close to the Central Park. 

I would recommend to sit out when weather permits, as inside was just too crowded."

Iced mocha was great as it wasn't sweetened! I'm so happy to find a place that doesn't make every coffee drink taste like a candy bar. Bravo! Also, the flourless double chocolate cookie was great. A bit fluffy, but still great."

I am italian from Milan and I obviously stop by here because of italian coffee and good croissants. I really love this place, but it seriously annoyed me.
It's not possible waiting so much time to be served: the girls at the bar are always too slow. Today I entered at 11.58, with only 3 people before me at the cashier; I received my cappuccino and croissant at 12.18: 20 MINUTES for a cappuccino and croissant, on Sunday, with 13 people in total inside the bar.
It's always like that, but today it was really too much, and for the price I pay all the time, I expect a different service (for example available napkins too!).
I will change place for my coffee."

1007,sant-ambroeus-coffee-bar-at-loews-regency-hotel-new-york-3,2018-02-09,5.0,"oh my.... they should have sent a poet...

we ordered four things

1. Almond Croissant
2. chocolate covered thingy from heaven
3. lemon tart from somewhere above heaven that looks like egg yoked on top... it was likely some lemon flavored super drug...
4. Pecan Tart.... like no other pecan pie in the world. Imagine the smoothest scotch ever made, but instead it's a dessert.. it's like getting a hug from Oprah... it's the taste equivalent of smelling a newborn baby's head... it's like licking Gods spatula...

and i hate pecan pie...

i ""high""-ly recommend flying to new york from seattle, on your last dime, and walking here on glass  in sub-zero temps, eating the pecan tart, and then jump in front of a bus afterward, because all food will taste like garbage when you leave. And your live will steep deep into misery until you can have another...but, sadly, you will chase the pecan dragon for the rest of your sorrowful days, trying, always trying to find that first euphoric bite.... 

the end..."

They have outdoor seating, no seats inside but there are tables to stand at. 

The coffee is very good, they have several good choices for breakfast; fruit, yoghurt with fruit and crunchy stuff and croissants with salmon. They also have plain croissants and different kinds of pastry. 

My favourites are the yoghurt and the croissants with salmon. Fresh and delicious. 

We also tried some of their sandwiches for lunch, they are really good too. My favourite was the panini with ham and cheese. 

I also saw that they sold ice cream in the afternoon, unfortunately I didn't taste it. So much food, so little time :-)

The staff is very friendly and the service is fast. Perfect for a quick breakfast or just a cup of coffee."

I would have to go onto their website and read up on who they are/what they wanna share with us because I couldn't make sense of it.  

The menu was very limited, I couldn't make a choice.  I know we are usually overwhelmed with variety yet either this cookie or that cookie was ""demanding""... for lack of a better term at the moment.  

Maybe their goal is to be an extreme opposite to ""the other guys"".

Still diggin' on the Moroccan Lentil soup. One of my favs. Just don't enter the bathroom after you see me walking out. Just saying.

Spicy Shrimp & Cilantro wrap is solid, and the tuna sandwich is also good if you're a non-meat eater as myself.

Even late in the day or early evening there are usually a few options left to enjoy.

I got -admittedly - lost while trying to find a lunch food truck earlier today. And after google maps failed me numerous times, I decided to drop in here for a snack and an iced beverage, after walking past it a number of times.

Service? 5/5
SUPER nice and friendly staff, one of the girls (Nicky?) had apparently seen me walking down the street a few times (LOST PROBLEMS) and liked my hat, and then lo and behold I ended up coming here. Weird world, but I really appreciate it, I had just been running away from a creep and everyone so far has been so rude. A breath of fresh air here.

Interior? 5/5
Biased because it fits my aesthetics HAHA.
Brick and lighter woods. Lots of air conditioning, super nice since its so hot outside - though I feel for the staff that are freezing in here. 

Food? Drink?
Fresh fruit was good. Coming from a state where fruit produce is our main crop, we get a lot of fresh fruit for cheap. The price here isn't bad at all - the last I saw was $10?! - and the tea is great! Not too sweet, not too bitter. (Iced Green Tea)

10/10 would reccommend to any traveler, or just anyone nearby. Pricing on salads and other foods were good too."

I've gotten their avocado and chicken salad, which you can't go wrong with for about $9.75 and never found a bad leaf.  The avocado is always green and the chicken isn't suspicious like many meats you may find in random salad places.  It's all pre-packaged and made in the same day, which is great because you can just grab and go and be assured that you're getting a quality lunch.  Sometimes it gets crowded, but the line usually goes by very fast since people only have to pay.

Highly recommend their freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice as well.  Very delicious!"

It's low calorie and absolutely delicious. 

On the side note, their desserts are also really good!!! I love love love this place. I would get it all the time except it's a little pricy and they run out of my favorite picks sometimes. Other then that, nothing to complain about :)"

It is still a better lunch option than most of the others in the area in which you have to wait for your food to be prepared and never really know what you are going to get. The food here is consistent and that is important for calorie counters like me who use apps to track my intake. The cost is a little high but considering the high quality, freshness and the fact that they donate leftovers to the homeless makes up for the price difference!"

1008,pret-a-manger-new-york-31,2012-01-09,4.0,"I remember my first trip to London when I was in my early 20s. I was there visiting my friend Muyiwa who introduced me to several Londoners. Dean and Aly like Muyiwa became long time friends. We went to great restaurants, lifted our pints in countless pubs, and danced to the wee hours in several posh night clubs. I especially enjoyed talking to the ladies and listening to every single word that flowed off their lips in that lovely British accent. Every encounter was a captivating experience.

One day while strolling around town I noticed a sign which activated my curiosity, Pret A Manger it read. When I entered I saw a bevy of sandwiches, crisped, and interesting beverages displayed smartly in refrigerated cases. The Coronation Chicken, Tuna and Cucumber, and Classic Super Club quickly became my favorites.

Fast forward several years to NYC on Lexington Avenue

I heard that Pret A Manger opened a location not to far from my apartment on the upper east side and I was on my way there. Once I saw the sign and got my first glimpse inside the store it really took me back to London so many years ago. The eats were just as I remembered them and the standard was of the highest quality. I was delighted to share a picnic lunch from Pret A Manger with Niki when we first started dating.

Today the sandwiches are different but still very tasty. I tried the California Club last I was in the store. It was very tasty and since I was in a hurry the convenience of grab, pay, and go was great. I think they should put a few of the classics back on the shelf and putting cucumbers back in the tuna sandwich would be a good move too. Besides that I am looking forward to my next visit."
1008,pret-a-manger-new-york-31,2011-01-26,3.0,"Pret-a-Manger during lunch hours is typically great for those desiring healthier versions of the unexcitingly safe trio (soups, salads, and sandwiches). One needs only suspend their desire to obtain a ""value"" meal, and you basically have a place that is perfectly catered for the indecisive. That is not to say it is bad. But, at least Cafe Metro attempts to be adventurous with their custom pizza and pasta stations.

For this midtown employee, the redeeming aspect of this Pret location is the ability to lounge out.  Large plush seats and low round tables are quite inviting for those who want a place to sit down, put your legs up, and schmooze for an hour. Their chocolate chip cookies and croissants are good to munch on all day long. In the end, Pret is excellent for cookies and comfort. 

A solid 3-star experience (especially if you stay away from the pathetically bland coffees and chais)."
1008,pret-a-manger-new-york-31,2013-04-15,3.0,"I walked past Pret to go to another place for lunch and then saw their display and went in. Loved how quick and healthy the place was. They have a lot of sandwiches, baguettes, salads on display which you can choose. Price too is reasonable.

Lunch time was busy but i was able to get a table relatively quickly once i picked up my order. I ordered cappuccino on my way out and it was horrible, so knocked one star out. I really wanted to give them for price and quality of food here. The staff was friendly and i really liked the decor here.

Cool line on the napkin - If our staff gets very excited and give you more napkins that you need or want, give them the evil eye. Need not- want not. (Or something similar) :) I love this place just be warned about cappuccino though, the barista has no idea how to make it!"

This is a huge pet peeve for me, because it makes me think th me customer isn't important. Then I asked for cream cheese and butter for my order, neither did I get. Then I thought she said she's getting me a bag so I wait, she walks away then when she comes back she said ""oh did you want a bag for your order?"" I am one person, ordering food for three people and I walked over in the rain, so yes I did want a bag but since it was such a burden to the ""customer service rep"" I left holding everything in my hands upset.

The first time I tried Pret was in London in 2006.  While I preferred the food there to the U.S., it's been years and I continue to have lunch there whenever I'm looking for a quick bite to eat or lunch to go.  

I really love that they have smaller sandwiches of the ones I enjoy, such as the tuna with cucumber. 

Also, if you're looking for something hot, the buffalo chicken is really good. Falafel wrap is just ok.  

Soups are also pretty good, try the moroccan lentil. 

Glad they're next to Duane Reade because the chips/popcorn selection here are not that good."

I love the Bang Bang Chicken Wrap:) on our recent trip to NYC Pret became a staple for us as it's a great quick, affordable, healthy place to eat in the city and it has free WiFi which is always helpful when you're travelling. Another perk is that these cafés seem to be everywhere so it's always a convenient place for a snack, meal or just a break:) I'd give it 5 stars but I'm going with 4 only because the tables were often messy from the previous customer but the staff were always very happy to wipe the table when I asked:)"

I absolutely adore New York City, so I just swallow up everything it has to offer.  About a block and a half from the hotel, there was this Pret a Manger.  I stopped in to get some coffee and breakfast.  I wish so much that Chicago had a Pret.  During my three days in New York, I had breakfast and coffee here everyday.  The first day I had the ham, cheese, and tomato croissant.  It was a little decadent for breakfast, but so delicious.  The next two days I had the blueberry compote and granola yogurt, and then the petite yogurt.  Both of these were so good.  

The cashiers were also extremely friendly and nice.  One of them said that they thought I looked like I could be the mom of Charlotte's adopted girl on Sex and the City, a comment that brought a smile to my face. 

My friend Gina just told me they are opening a Pret in Chicago, YEAY!"

1008,pret-a-manger-new-york-31,2012-01-06,4.0,"I'm not usually a fan of anything pre-made, but Pret is my go to spot for a quick take out lunch. The staff is friendly and efficient, and the food is always fresh, even if you can't customize it. I also highly recommend the soups.

It's also one of the few places you can get a simple sandwich for less than 6 bucks."
1008,pret-a-manger-new-york-31,2011-04-04,3.0,"This Pret could be great, but there a couple problems.  First, the good stuff: This Pret (and all others I've been too) really does have some of the best quick lunch food around.  The sandwiches are always very fresh and there's a large, diverse selection.  Almost everything I've tried here has been satisfying, and there are a lot of vegetarian options.  The food isn't cheap but it's also not over-the-top spendy.  Furthermore, the staff here are very nice and hospitable.  It's a solid place to sit down and have a quick lunch.

Unfortunately, this particular location is trolled by a manager who is consistently rude to his employees and dismissive towards customers.  He occasionally forces them to shout nonsensical garbage about how everyone loves a chicken sandwich or how they've got warm pastries.  If you've ever been to a Coldstone Creamery, you know what I'm talking about.  He's just one guy but somehow he gives the whole place negative vibe - you can immediately see how fearful the employees are of him and it's very uncomfortable.  

The other problem is the seating: way too many living room style lounge chairs with coffee tables, not enough room for solo people or couples.  This is a pretty minor complaint, but when you go in for lunch and there's nowhere to sit because two guys are sitting in lounge chairs and taking up 15% of the room, it's distressing."
1008,pret-a-manger-new-york-31,2009-09-14,4.0,"3.5 stars...I had never been to a Pret A Manger before, and if you haven't either, it's like a Starbucks with less emphasis on coffee and more emphasis on pre-made sandwiches, wraps, and salads. I've never been a real fan of pre-made sandwiches but I bet if you like most of their selections and work near by or are in a rush this would be a life saver. Personally I just got the lemon poppyseed muffin which not only was delicious and fresh but was the perfect size for a snack (not the giant meal sized ones you'd find elsewhere). Unfortunately they charge as if it's a meal sized one. The place is very clean, and they set aside a good portion of their floor to a comfortable seating area to eat and chat your lunch break away. The selections here are a tad limited but it's a nice chain and is worth checking out."

I love all of their sandwiches and wraps, and try to eat healthy - but sometimes I feel like they go overboard with their dressings and/or sauces.

1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2020-01-21,4.0,"3.5 stars seems appropriate for this spot, I want to like them a bit more simply because of the vast majority of items and options they've got in the place.   They've got some greedy stuff I if you navigate or properly but you'll pay the price... in time as well, they are slow and inefficient.

For now they get ttyt Bebe edit of the doubt; I'll be back soon"
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-12-20,2.0,"Went here for breakfast, I think breakfast closes at 11 because they had no eggs or veggies left, then I tried getting a smoothie and they said the lady wasn't there yet so, I had nothing. 

Works as a quiet place with space to catch up with friends as you're traveling the city tho!"
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-11-17,4.0,"Freedom of choice.  Spaciousness.  Copious table space.  Privacy.  Large buffet: things like citrus fruit, asparagus, curd cultured yogurt, choice of nut toppings, starchy white rice, potatoes...well, boy!

Say, ""Probiotics,"" or  ""Low-purine"" or ""Lectins"" and every nutritionist in the free world feels the special-diet hairs on his neck go, ""Woo, woo, woo!""

But the big plus is, as Helen Reddi sings in ""Peaceful,"" ...""there's no one bending over my shoulder; nobody breathing in my ear.""

There's space, even, to forget about the corruption of Democrat Party NSA officials...

... who are attacking prominent members OF THE REPUBLICAN BASE, to counter strong Republican economy and Democrat corruption and economic and social devastation in large cities.

Parading partisan fake female ""victims"" with rehearsed tears and lies - all lawyer-prepared (as in the contrived Kavanaugh mud-slinging hearings) - across tv, on CNN, the above-the-law, unelected bureaucrats broke into American citizens' conversations to look for racist, sexist comments for the political benefit for, and legal attacks by, Leftist Internationalist criminal cabals.

These Leftist leaders use financial leverage, race, sexism and rank, over government careerists, to attack and conduct illegal surveillance of us and our President, to nullify our votes, to protect those with the political POWER to operate outside the law: re: Bidens, Clintons, Bushes, FBI, CIA, IRS, NSA, and the main ringleader OBAMA, working for the mass murder and/or economic enslavement of the western world.

Weak Republicans joined in and assisted the Democrat Leftists to protect their own corruption, such as the McConnell and McCain families, who worked against their own party.

Hillary Clinton, who nearly became President, would have certainly kept her promise to eviscerate her middle class opposition - the final shot in her serial Thrill Kills...that began with Somalia, then Foster, American healthcare recipients, Jewish children, victims of terrorist Arafat, and American sailors, murdered in the USS Cole attack...

...ignoring pleas for help by Ambassador Stevens and the three other heroes under attack, murdered by al Qaeda, while she sat in her office making deals using the Secretary of State position for self-benefiting illicit corruption deals...totaling $300 million in a career dedicated to appointing vulnerable, pliable American lackeys...

...included weak corrupt leaders in Russia and Ukraine, the Middle East, playing one nation off against another...worldwide...abusing all taxpayers, everywhere.

Obama and his Leftist thieves, fellow fascists and communists, and fake academics, hustle for man-made climate government regulations and race-bait, for power- and money-grabs, instigating mass migrations here and in Europe.

True scientific facts:  Continental drift, plate tectonics and changes in earth's oval orbit, currently as round as it can get, will lead to global cooling in a few hundred centuries...while earth's changing tilt on its axis, and 1500 foot cores studies, and magnetic field reversals are the measurable indicators of future changing oceans basins, future tides, future continents merging, and it is fact that Mars lost its atmosphere when it lost its magnetic field.

Bloomberg cuts a sad Stalinist profile.

Joe Biden was caught red handed.

Hillary, Comey and McCabe still walk free.

Where's Barr HIDING?"
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-07-29,4.0,"This place is located inside a mini food market, it's a cute place that has a corner to itself. 
The service was good, the cashier and the guy making my smoothie were nice and attentive. 
I ordered the Go Green Acai Bowl, it was $9.95. I don't think the taste was anything too special, and the bowl was actually kind of small for a $10 bowl. 
If I did come here again, I wouldn't get an acai bowl because I don't think the price is worth what you get. 
Looking at their menu, the bubble tea is also expensive, $6.50 for a large. This place is general is a little bit more expensive than others I would say."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-10-05,4.0,"I used to work around the corner from this place and I was almost always too busy to get lunch. I don't think I can ever forgive my former employer from keeping me away from this hot-lunch Mecca.

I consider myself somewhat of a midtown Korean buffet connoisseur, and this place sets the standard. My doctor's office is located nearby and every time I have an appointment I make it a point to get lunch here. They have discrete stations for ramen, sushi, pasta, burgers and Tex Mex, as well as two long steam tables packed with hot and cold offerings. They have premium stuff like roast pig (with cracklings!), duck, beef loin and whole fish. The fried foods are always delightfully crispy and the quesadillas are massive and well assembled.

Go before noon to beat the lunch rush, and to snag the best stuff. Because if you get there after me there won't be any crispy pork skin left.

P.S. They have a second location at Lex and 55th and while I go there three times a week, like 90210 it's a sadder version of the OG."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-11-02,3.0,I tried to order a buffalo chicken wrap that was on the board. The gentleman behind the counter tells me that they don't have wraps on the weekend? I decided to get a philli cheesesteak which was decent but not the best. My friend ordered a cheese burger with Ava ado and an egg and asked for mayo and no ketchup. Only to watch him put only ketchup and no mayo. They have a wide variety of snack from small cakes to assorted different brands of cookies.
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-07-23,5.0,I've came in a few times for paninis which have been really good and breakfast platters. The guys are always so pleasant in the morning. Today I came in for an Açaí bowl and it was so delicious for a fair price! The man preparing them even added extra toppings like strawberries and berries! It's always packed during lunch time but the checkout line moves very fast.
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-07-12,1.0,"This place is rude. 
Listen, if I spend money I spend money for QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THE CASHIERS ARE NASTY AND RUDE. 
The food is not even worth it to be honest. 
I used to come here often always got sass and my money snatched out my hands. I stopped coming here when one of them yelled at my boyfriend for wanting coffee and he was on his laptop at the time before ordering."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-08-16,4.0,"The best deli/salad bar/sandwich shop/pasta bar in Manhattan. Amazing selection and terrific quality. Eat in is a little uncomfortable because the tables are small. Most people take the food back to their office.

If you work in the area, this is THE place for lunch."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-07-31,1.0,I've had the Hawaiian acai bowl and replaced the banana with blueberries. It's the worst acai I've ever had! The oats were just regular oats they didn't even toast it and they should've put granola instead of oats. The blackberries were sour. The acai was gooey not even chilled!
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-03-20,5.0,"I went here for lunch a few weeks ago off a recommendation from a coworker because it's so convenient to our office. After getting a salad there (yum) I looked up Cafe Olympia on Yelp and was shocked by the low rating. This place is great! They have so many options for whatever you may be in the mood for, from salad and sandwiches, to a hot bar, Japanese and Korean food and much much more.

The place itself is pretty standard, really big open space with lots of kiosks with the different types of food. There are tables to sit down at, as well as free wifi (which is sometimes wonky at first but it will work). I personally usually get the salad (I got there at least twice a week now) and if you don't get a meat then you're actually allowed 6 options to have with the salad instead of 4! I also just had the veggie ramen today which was pretty good as well, they make it fresh right in front of you.

Yes the cashiers are pretty short with you, but such is the standard for a busy lunch spot in Manhattan. If they were going slowly and taking their time to talk to you I'm sure dozens of people would be pretty upset.  There is a $7 card minimum, but most of the lunch dishes cost just around that after tax anyway so hasn't been an issue for me. 

This place is so much more affordable than many of the other lunch spots around, and I go here often and haven't been given a reason not to come back! The salads are also really good and if you haven't tried the lime chipotle dressing you definitely should!"
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-09-04,1.0,"I popped in after purchasing a salad to get an extra fork, since I forgot to ask for one.  One of the Asian ladies at the register (fake blonde, hoop nose ring, acne) huffed while giving it to me. So rude. Wouldn't return."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-05-02,3.0,"Stopped in today for a very late lunch (4pm) and went to the buffet spread . There's plenty of options to pick from . I ended up getting 5 or 6 items, and I found the food to be decent . Would I go out of my way again, probably not, but it's good to know there's a place open 24hrs with a decent spread ."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-06-06,3.0,"Not far from where I was staying, Cafe Olympia was a reasonable option for quick buys. I was  actually here three times in three days simply because it was convenient. There is an assortment of items from ice cream, to coffee, to beverages, to fresh fruit, snacks, and their buffet offerings and made to order counter. I was mostly interested in getting a yogurt or kobucha or a banana for quick bites since breakfast wasn't an option at my hostel.  While prices are admitedly high, $5+ for a kombucha which costs $3 back home, it is the reality of being in NYC. I do question the ""I'll charge you $6 instead of 5.99 and no tax""... Do they even charge tax on kombucha in NYC? If it had been a food item, is there tax on that? I'm not losing sleep over pennies, I'm just curious if there is some shadiness going on...

Overall, for my needs I cant really complain. Would stop in again for the convenience."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-11-25,4.0,"This store is a really good place to go for anything you wish to get ... it's a big store where u get fresh juices, acai bowls, sandwiches.. noodles and buffet like you get everything breakfast lunch and dinner ... it's clean and people out there seems pretty nice and I would definitely recommend people to go there as I live nearby and I go there a lot.. thanks for making it easy for me"
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-12-14,5.0,"They have renovated and the seating is great. The bacon, egg, cheese sandwich is a classic! always goo-ey with extra soft roll. Nice big portion. Bacon is cooked correctly. Get a side of potatoes for a hearty breakfast! For lunch, excellent variety of choices at different stations and solid salad bar. By dinner time, things are winding down and not all stations are open."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-09-24,3.0,"Boy, do they have everything here. That's cool. Butttt,  just another typical Manhattan Super Deli. Busy, so you know things move.
Decently Clean, so I would choose this over some others. Pretty Good Açaí bowls! If you are in the area and you want something good and fast, this is an ok option."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-11-11,1.0,"Used to come here for a quick snack but service is getting worse and worse. Last time there were a few gentlemen who could barely speak English and were very rude. They did not want to prepare any of the menu items. 
I complained to the kid at the cashier and he barely helped. I'm not coming here ever again, except to complain with the owner who usually stays at night."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-10-20,3.0,"This place is pricey but you get what you pay for, the food is good. I'm leaving three stars because they take FOREVER to make your food. This is New York, no one has ten minutes to stand there and wait for a sandwich."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-05-20,1.0,"They charge more than what their menu states. It's probably better to order exactly what you want, even if it's not on the menu, and ask how much it will be. 
I also found the food to be very greasy and heavy. I couldn't eat it."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-06-16,4.0,"used to dine here with colleagues from the UN, came back today to relive the old days :) A great variety of food to choose from. Yummy pork ribs."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2017-10-09,1.0,"It's very disgusting and shady that the place is selling expired food. I bought the gum this morning. When I was chewing it, I felt something weird of the gum. I always buy the same brand, so I can know it. Then I check the package, and I noticed that somebody deliberately destroyed the label so that customer would recognize that it was expired. 

This behavior is really awful and irresponsible."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-05-25,1.0,"Arrogant, arrogant staff at deli counter and checkout.  Checkout staff couldnt even get off the f*ckn phone to pay for food.  Never coming here again."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2017-12-05,3.0,"There are a lot of options here. Anything ranging from shrimp fried rice to yams can is part of the hot bar. There are also salad bars, a place for acai bowls and sandwiches. Be careful, however. Food from the hot bar is weighed, and it can get pretty pricey, pretty quickly. It gets crowded around lunchtime, and there are not enough seats to dine in when busy. The food is o.k. It depends on the day, to be honest, but if you're indecisive, it may be an ideal spot to go to get a little of everything."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2015-04-22,4.0,"The Quick: For an in and out lunch, or a quick lunch eaten at the long wooden tables, this is an obvious good choice. The food is reasonably priced, local discount, and lots of options. It also seems very clean.

The Details: For strictly the salad bar, this place had plenty of options. One protein plus 4 toppings (any toppings including avocado, egg whites, etc) for one price. There was also ample dressing choices... The options are limitless. 

I found the salad very fresh and the ingredients very flavorful. I also enjoyed the communal long wooden tables that overlooked Lexington Avenue, perfect for people watching. 

Obviously you would never go here on a date, or for a big night out. It's perfect for what it is, a quick lunch and a break from the office with healthy options 

The Damage: after my company discounts my salad came to ~$6.50. So much more reasonable than other options in the area
."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2017-04-26,3.0,"So far, this is my go-to for lunch break. It is clean, modern, and offers a variety of literally everything you can think of. You can get burgers and quesadillas on one side, Korean food and sushi on the other, then in the middle is a yummy hot foods bar. There's even a cafe with pastries and cake to the left of the entrance.

Notes: While I do wish the hot food could be hotter, it's maintained and replenished often. I love the jap chae!
The sushi rolls are huge. And fresh.
The health drink selection is awesome. I got a detox aloe water that's flavored with lychee & white grape.
I've had nothing but fast and friendly service here :)"
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2017-09-19,3.0,"Everything you could possibly want on a lunch break!  Smoothies & acai bowls, coffee, bagels, sandwiches, salads, pasta, quesadillas, burgers, sushi, udon noodles, and snacks and drinks galore.  The food quality is good, nothing spectacular, but it is fast and convenient.  I regularly come here for sushi, kombucha, and peanut butter filled pretzels.  

There is a $7 card minimum, which is the only downside since sometimes I just come by for one thing before work."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2019-04-17,2.0,"Beware of pricing in this deli . . . if you're not getting prepared food (sandwich or salad bar), but picking up something from the shelves, nothing (and I mean absolutely nothing!) has a price on it . . . they charge you whatever they feel like (because if there's no price on the item, how does the cashier know how much it is?)  The only good thing I can say about the place is that it's open 24 hours a day, which for those of us living in the neighborhood is very convenient (as long as you're okay with not knowing the price of anything when you bring it up to the counter)!  After writing this, I'm going to do some research on NYC consumer laws . . . I can't believe it's legal in NYC to have a store with no prices!!"
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2016-03-15,1.0,"I have been there twice now--both before work picking up breakfast and I have to say: disappointed.

My roommates and I all work in the area-ish and we were talking about cheapest chopped salad options and one of my roommates mentioned Cafe Olympia.  I had never heard of it.  As life goes, the next day I passed it on my way to work while utterly famished and craving a smoothie.  

That day, I got a large smoothie, which was smaller than any small smoothie I have ever gotten, and a yogurt and it cost $9.  I shamed myself for buying smoothies--its such a waste of money, but so delicious (and this one really was delicious, the one good thing about this place).

I went back again this morning and ordered a spinach, feta, and onion omelette.  They did not put the feta in (fine) but then charged me $4.95--for just the omelette.  No bread, no potatoes.  I also got a diet dr. pepper and at the hot food bar I got two hashbrowns--which tasted like shit, btw.  The total charge was $9.50 AGAIN.  Okay, so 4.95 for the hashbrowns, let's say 2.50 for the diet dr pepper, which would be expensive but not unheard of, brings us to $7.50, which means my two pay by the weight hashbrowns cost $2???? It was early and I wasn't thinking when I paid, but I will definitely never return.  They clearly just like to take money and make crappy food, albeit delicious smoothies."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2017-07-03,1.0,"The owner is super rude and their prices are absurd. It's very hard to get me angry and this place accomplished that. They once charged me $5 for about 10 ice cubes. It was a very hot day and we ran out of ice. Out of desperation, I walked in and saw cups of ice in the freezer. I took 3 cups and it came out to $15. So I paid $15 for frozen tap water. 

Another time, the owner furiously yelled at one of the patrons for taking an extra packet of crackers for her soup. 

Stay away unless you  are desperate and have no other options."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-07-23,5.0,We visited the United Nations during our trip to New York and the family friend who works for the UN recommended this place to us. We were starving after hours of walking inside the UN and were glad to be able to quickly pick out what we like among so many options for hot dishes and salads. The food tasted pretty delicious to us.
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-04-03,2.0,"I tend to order lunch from this place because it's close to my office.  However, they almost always get the order wrong. The Smoked Turkey Sandwich that I got, which is described as having ""smoked turkey, roasted red peppers, bacon, lettuce, tomato and ranch dressing on an orilan focaccia"" only had the peppers, turkey, and cheese. There was no bacon, lettuce, or tomato; they put Russian dressing instead of Ranch, and it was in a hero instead of Focaccia.  Any of the steak quesadillas are actually just cheese steak quesadillas. (And I've found papers mixed into the steak before.) And spinach salad with dressing on the side is somehow turned into Arugula salad with dressing mixed in."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-06-27,5.0,"This deli is perfect for people on the go as well as those who want to sit down for a hot meal. You can also go grocery shopping here as they have a wide variety of selection to take home with you including wine. Everything is fresh made and there's a ton of healthy eating options here for those health food nuts. I particularly love their noodle bar, gotta have me my ramen on those rainy days!"
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2017-07-19,3.0,"Food choices are good so many varieties depending on what you're in the mood for. However the heat in this place is unbearable and makes it super uncomfortable to eat. You just rush through the food without enjoying it. Also, I found a hair in my mac n cheese. The manager was able to have me select a new plate of food."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2016-09-25,1.0,"I live extremely close by to this cafe and as convenient as it is for those late night supper runs, I loathe coming in here. I've had about 3 bad experiences with the staff members here. Once was asking the guy behind the counter to give me literally 2 ice cubes so I can make my extremely hot coffee more drinkable---he tried to charge me 25 cents for 2 ice cubes. Another time was this girl at the cashier who literally GLARED at me when I tried to swipe my credit card for a $5 bill. And the 3rd time was quite recent- John's Coffee Shop was extremely crowded for brunch so I decided to come here to get a quick to go brunch. I think it was around 11:10am and the mexican ""cooks"" refussssssed to make me an egg sandwich because their breakfast hour was only till 11:00am. He went as far as saying: we don't have any eggs. Which later turned out to be a complete lie- 

I hate saying this because it makes me sound racist but I've only had bad experiences with the hispanic/latino workers in here. The asian workers are nothing but nice to me... idk man...i really hope they would fix this situation."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-04-17,2.0,"Stopped in for breakfast but wish I had known John's was so close. Big cafeteria style place with many options for all meals of the day.  I asked egg, turkey bacon snd cheese on a roll but am sure I got a handful of the cold pre-cooked bacon in the corner of the griddle. Coffee is awful."
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2017-06-29,4.0,"Cafe Olympia near UN headquarters offers a diverse range of foods. From pad Thai to salad bars to burritos. Yum! My favorite so far is the acaí bowls! (California girl in the city what do you expect! ) Prices for acaí bowls range from $7.50 to $10, not bad for both acaí bowls and the city! I tried the ""Go Green"" acaí bowl, which is full of kale, acaí, spinach, fruits, and granola! Quite filling and delicious! Looking forward to trying the other options! (Darn, I should have taken a picture of the menu. Next time!) Cafe Olympia, I'll be back!"
1009,cafe-olympia-new-york,2018-06-06,3.0,It was okay. They have everythingggg from affordable sushi so sandwiches and good candy. But they guy who made my sandwich was really rude and made me feel so pressured when making my sandwich. He wouldn't tell me what any of the toppings options were and got mad when I didn't know what they did and didn't have! Well I finally got my sandwich and it was soo average.

Healthy, fresh food options, very clean location, and the nicest staff in the neighborhood!!  Joanna (sp?) is so sweet."
1010,pret-a-manger-new-york-49,2019-01-09,5.0,"Yes, a 5-star review for Pret and I'll tell you more on why! I've been a long-tome customer of Pret. This particular Pret on 425 Lexington I've been frequenting for over 2 years. This week, comes the review. The reason for the review is for this location's amazing employee Ashawn. Not only is Ashawn extremely friendly and personable, but super-honest. I left my credit card in the machine two days ago and today I went t back To see if it happened to be there and they actually had it safe and sound for me in the safe!! I was amazed as I was just about ready to cancel my card and request a new one from my bank. So thank you Ashawn!! You are a rockstar !!

So I frequent this Pret at least 3-4 times a week for breakfast and/or lunch. Great food, lots of healthy options and pleasant employees. Can't beat it. 

Thank you again to the entire crew at 425 Lex! You guys are seriously my peeps!! I cannot thank you enough. 

Happy New Year!!"
1010,pret-a-manger-new-york-49,2018-09-15,3.0,"The first time I've had Pret A Manger was when I was in Paris, so I was pleasantly surprise to see the chain in NY as I was walking to work. I decided to pop in for some breakfast.

I ordered a 12oz latte and a banana. I requested for the barista to use 2% milk but I think I was given skim milk instead. It wasn't bad, but the latte was definitely not creamy. I was also able to pick out my own banana from the basket.

Overall, I read the 1-star reviews on Yelp for this location, but luckily my experience wasn't bad at all. My only complaint was that my latte was really hot and I wasn't given a cup sleeve. They didn't have any readily available either. I had to switch hands multiple times to prevent burning myself."

The staff was friendly and their green iced tea is sooo good, especially on this hot NYC summer day. I just really appreciate their large variety of grab and go food items that are pretty healthy. There are some shops and other things nearby which I enjoy. A seat by the window is nice to people watch and kill time as well."

I previously stopped frequenting this location because of the service but I have resumed going frequently again. The atmosphere is pleasant, clean and shelves are always stocked and being freshly restocked."
1010,pret-a-manger-new-york-49,2019-01-28,1.0,"Terrible experience. I walked in today on 1/28/19 at around 3pm to grab some sandwiches on my lunch break. I got a sandwich that needed to be heated up/toasted (a cubano) and another cold sandwich. I set the two sandwiches down on the counter and the employee held up the cubano and said ""just this one?"" So I thought he meant just that one needed to be heated, which in turn I replied ""yes just that one"" 

The employee then goes to heat it up and charges me. I look down at the card machine and see that my total is only 8 something which can't be the price of two sandwiches. When I look up, he was already heating the sandwich so I did not want to shout and call him over. The girl employee who was next to him then sees my confused face and I tell her that he only charged me for one sandwich. She has much better service btw. I wish I was in her line so I did not have to encounter him. He then comes running back and says to me in the nastiest expression and tone, ""When I asked you just one, you replied with yes, just one"". Why must I get scolded because you did not see the two sandwiches that I put down on the counter? I've never felt more berated for just wanting to get another sandwich. What is the big deal? Just charge me again. No need to give me an attitude and ruin my meal and my afternoon. Please speak to this employee, he was incredibly rude. Terrible attitude and service."
1010,pret-a-manger-new-york-49,2018-02-25,1.0,"Walked into store, clerk behind counter and myself the only customer in the store. I was not greeted. Brought my purchase up to the counter and the only thing Danielle #2593 said to me was the cost of my purchase. I was not even given a thank you, or have a good night. Handed my purchase in a bag and asked if i wanted my receipt (that i guess she threw away because i received a backup receipt) handed me the receipt and no thank you for my business or good evening. Customer service is everything in today's world and this shop did not have it. 
Sandwich bread was also tough to chew and did not taste fresh."

1010,pret-a-manger-new-york-49,2018-08-25,1.0,All in all cashiers are over charging guest and not presenting them with Their receipts. When you do ask for it they say they don't have it with an attitude. I am a supervisor in a food establishment As well and I think this is unacceptable. The cashier thought because I was a new face she was going to get over on me but luckily I have sense and I caught on. The manager or Supervisor ended up finding my receipt and giving me what I Was owed. Now imagine the others who aren't thinking and getting over charged so cashiers can pocket the money. I wouldn't have expected this at pret to be honest.
1010,pret-a-manger-new-york-49,2015-05-09,5.0,"On Wednesday Morning I needed a quick bite to eat and a killer coffee drink to start my day.  Popped into this local Pret A Manger located around the corner from the hotel I was at.  Decided to get a giant cup of thick Greek yogurt with blueberries/granola.  To drink I ordered a large chai latte.  

Both were amazing.  The yogurt was one of the best ever.  My chai latte was thick whipped and flavorful.  I was a happy camper and knew that this was going to be a great day.

Wish you would open a location across from my house in Los Angeles.  this was way too good to be true.  Staff working here were ridiculously friendly."

The food it decent, The Staff is friendly, there is decent seating available that is if you want to, not really sure who would want to have a ""Sit Down"" meal at Pret A Manger.
The one thing I like about them is you know the food is always fresh, and good quality. Love the Egg Salad Sandwich and the Hot Warps, the Soups ain't that bad either. Few might feel the pinch in the wallet for a full meal like say a Sandwich and a Soup would run you about $15 give or take not all would want to spend that at a Deli, know what I am saying...

But yet there are Pret's all around the city and its a best option to get a quick grub with no suprises."

1010,pret-a-manger-new-york-49,2015-09-29,3.0,I know reviewing a Pret A manger....  I like this Pret A Manger because it is less crowded than the one closer to Grand Central Station.  It's pretty much the same as any other one. People are nice and quick with the service.  I didn't experience any shortages of anything and my sandwich was tasty and fresh although a bit on the small side.  Only problem with Pret is the prices are high in proportion to the small size of the food purchased.  This is due to you subsidizing their corporate giving to the hobos of Manhattan.  Why can't they just make a contribution?
1010,pret-a-manger-new-york-49,2017-11-08,1.0,"I stopped by this place today for the first time because my new office is around there. Cashiers were really nice, but a ballista there was rude. The cashiers already told her orders including mine, but maybe she forgot and asked me what I was waiting for. That was totally fine. But when she made mine and said the name of coffee and I made sure if that was mine, her attitude was like "" What!? Couldn't you here what I said!?"" And said ""That's what you want!"" I don't expect a chain shop a good service though, that was terrible.
I got surprised and stared at her for a while. what I could say was just "" Thank you so much!"" Because I was really surprised. Then she started laughing. That was Unacceptable. 
I guess she looked down on me thinking I don't understand English. I'm not a native English speaker though, I work in the U.S (clients are New Yorkers)and off course I've never had any English problem just to get a coffee."

1010,pret-a-manger-new-york-49,2016-01-25,2.0,"I am very disappointed to see that Pret's breakfast sandwiches have become more expensive and more skimpy. Options like the Smoked Ham and Egg sandwich have considerably less ham and egg in them but they are charging noticeably more for it. The price of the Classic Cheddar and Tomato has also gone up more than is acceptable to me. Pret used to be my favorite go-to choice for breakfast. I have been a loyal customer for over 9.5 years, spending considerable amounts (a few thousand dollars per year). But now, seeing that they are raising the prices of their breakfast fare, and also offering disappointingly small, skimpy portions on many sandwich options, I will likely cut back on my spending at Pret considerably, using Pret now only for unavoidable, unplanned situations. Sorry, but their unreasonable pricing and portioning policies are going to cost them a very loyal customer! :-("

Being veggie, I figured I'd ask if any veggie soups were left in the kitchen, already prepped, that may not have made it to the shelf.  None were left, so the girl said she'd prep one up for me... and I got my tomato feta large!  Now that's customer service!  Thank you again!"

Limited hot sandwiches I hate cold sandwiches and even then they were out of that the juices I wasn't sure whether I should get the lemonade or not because usually when you get it from a store it was handmade it's very sweet and I can't take the tartness sometimes.  I ended up leaving because I'm a very picky person especially when it comes to sandwiches and didn't have much selection I think I came to we too early will give the spot another try at a different location probably Union Square

Vietnamese Sandwich - 1.5 stars:  This was just not very good at all, sorry.

My favorite items have been the turkey diner, patty melt, fried chicken, and the pancakes. I basically have never ordered anything that has disappointed. 

I highly recommend"
1011,cosmic-diner-new-york-3,2020-01-18,4.0,"A nice diner on 8th Avenue. We enjoyed the food but did not enjoy the manager hovering over our table to try to rush us out. 

The coffee was excellent.  The servers were excellent.  The food was good. The menu was full of choices. Watch the specials as for example it said juice and coffee and mimosa, but then server said it was juice or mimosa. We were not in the mood to argue, but they should honor what their own special calls for.

Really a shame they hovered over us. Three diners said the same thing. Just makes you uncomfortable. 

We would like to go back but hope they read this and realize that while they try to push people out they are really pushing away otherwise happy patrons. A little niceness goes a long way,  even in New York."

Anyways, had the Western Omelette with no potatoes and wife had scrambled eggs and bacon--all keto friendly. Then she comes back from paying and catches me eating all the bread!!!! Service was FAST and food was above average. All in all a good diner to go to if that is what the sitch calls for."

I ordered the western omelette with cheddar cheese and a side of bacon. The omelette itself comes with hash-browns. The food came out pretty fast and the server checked up on me to make sure I was good. Everything was well prepared and yummy.

The food was great. It is just classic American Diner so you've got everything from burgers and wraps to lasagna and meatloaf. Everything tasted good. I got the Caesar Wrap with fries. I was happy to find more chicken than lettuce. The fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. 

Restaurant was clean and decorated nicely. Overall, I'd say come for the good tasting food, but if you are looking for something unique or more cultural food try somewhere else. This is just your good ok' classic American diner."

He came by again literally five minutes later and said that I had to leave because ""I've been taking up the table for 2 hours!"" I don't know where he purchased his watch but if he thought that was two hours he should get a refund. So he insisted I leave, which I did, to go wait outside in the freezing rain for my fiancé and his mother.

Inside its spacious and modern, with 30 or so tables and booths. Service was friendly, efficient and very quick. Just like a diner should be.

I had bacon and eggs, hash browns, bacon and rye toast.  Eggs were perfect, sunny side up with slightly cooked, unbroken yolks. 4 strips of crisp bacon and a scoop of griddle seared hash browns - crunchy on the outside, firm and moist on the inside.  My only disappointment was no corned beef hash - but it's not on the menu here. 

Emily had a Greek wrap. Veggies and feta cheese in a whole wheat wrap. Veggies crisp and fresh with generous crumbles of feta. Plus fries on the side. Who says you can't have fries with breakfast? 

Amy enjoyed a vegetable omelet.  At least 3 eggs, perfectly prepared - flaky and moist and not scalded-- teeming with peppers, onions, tomato and cheese.  This was a good one. 

The tab was $53 for 3, on the expensive side for a traditional diner breakfast. But the food is good, the service is quick and the newly renovated space is comfortable."

And didn't even ask ur if we wanted a drink. Which ofc I told him we want it but all they had was Pepsi. We got our food and ask for a steak well done and it was rare. It was served with French fries and when I sent it back the French fries were gone. And the waiter was so confused when I asked for my fries and the menu said it included a soup or salad which the waiter did not ask us what we want it and was not planning to. So I ask him what happen and he said they didn't have but I was still going to be charge the same amount. So when I sent it back I go and eat it and it was still not well done. So I just didn't eat afraid they would spit on my food for sending it back another time. 
They did not ask a single time if we wanted a refills on our drinks. And when the check came that was more mysterious. They do the checks by hand and this old man can't write so I didn't understand what he charged us so we just paid and left. Not a good place don't recommend for anyone."

It had an all male staff which was a little discerning.  All male wait staff seemed odd to me in such a vast city.   

The diner was clean and the the coffee was hot and free. They had an amazing selection of baked items. Huge muffins and other great looking items. They had a small carousel of cheesecakes and cakes. They looked good but not diner made. Perhaps from a local bakery. 

I ordered a patty melt. Which traditionally means it (type of burger) comes on a hearty bread with a melty cheese.  The hubs ordered an omelette and well done hash browns. 

My patty melt came out as expected. It was good and tasty. The hubs however, was a sad sad plate. The omelette was flat and less than full. The hash browns were sad, NOT WELL DONE. 

This just might not be the place for breakfast! Skip it for breakfast."

He got upset, waved us off, and walked away... just because we weren't ready to order. We waited for him to come back with our drinks but after 10-15 minutes we left and we'll never come back.

Corned beef hash was smelly, straight from the supermarket type tin. Potatoes was fried together with bacon, even though I didn't have any bacon mentioned in my food. Eggs was fried with grease from something else.

But then again, it's all part of the charm of a diner, I suppose?  We came here around 11:30 am on a Sat for a quick bite after discovering the Victor's did not open until noon.  Definitely more of a grab a quick bite vs a sit-down - you won't be able to hear anything!

My 888 omelette was edible - egg whites, Swiss, avocado, 1 mushroom slice, tomatoes, and 2 pepper pieces.  It wasn't bad but quite sparse on the fillings and definitely on the small side for $15.  The Mexican omelette was also on the small side and with basically no fillings save for some jack cheese.  The omelettes were also unshaped and not rolled with the fillings so the cheese:egg ratio in each bite was very off - some bites were all cheese and others all egg; veggies were nonexistent.  

Our server didn't even ask what kind of toast we wanted and automatically threw down a plate of un-sliced, dry white toast.  It gets busy during weekend brunch, likely because it is right by Theater District so it's an option to grab a bite before a 2 pm Matinee.

I work in PR and I'm constantly having to go to midtown for meetings. The catch is, I can only choose restaurants and coffee shops that are reflective of my firm, which is in the ultra-luxury space.

Let me tell you- it's been tough. But now - alas - I've found my new go-to!

Red Fleece Cafe is conveniently located inside Brooks Brothers. It is very spacious (LOTS of tables for groups of 2-3, but the chairs and tables aren't nailed down so you can move them if needed), they wait on you after you order at the bar, the coffee is good, and they have a full menu for food!

Food & Drinks (Americano and Latte) [9/10]: The coffee was not so special in my opinion. Reasonable price. They were served in red coffee cups. Also have sandwiches and pastries.

1013,starbucks-reserve-new-york-5,2019-10-13,4.0,"One of the many Starbucks stores in Times Square but with a twist - this is a Starbucks Reserve bar offering drinks which you can't find in a regular Starbucks store, it is also really spacious too especially compared to other NYC stores which tend to be rather small with little (if any) seating - located on 1585 Broadway.

It is a busy location, obviously due to the location and Starbucks being a popular brand but with queuing in both directions around the counter, they seem to make the long line get served rather quickly - it did take a few minutes for my drink but considering how busy the store was I didn't mind.

The layout was a little confusing at first as you do queue in two different directions so I do feel this could be signposted a little better, however, the staff still seemed friendly while speedy and efficient.

Due to it being a Reserve location it feels much nicer and more modern than most other locations in NYC - excluding the Roastery in Chelsea. I do feel it needs much more seating however as I did struggle to get a seat, as this is a popular Starbucks.

I ordered my regular drink while in the Big Apple - a Venti Iced Caramel Cloud Macchiato, which came to $6.48, obviously US stores are a lot higher than the UK and this can sometimes work out around $1.6 more when converted but I found the pricing for this beverage more reasonable as it is exclusive to the US.

I do feel the tables could have been cleaned more regularly and the music like many stores in NYC was again far too loud (Is there a competition for turning Starbucks' stores into a nightclub or something blasting loud music?), but still this is probably one of my favourite central stores in NYC with the added benefit of Reserve facilities (extra drink choices and merch.)

What is Reserve Roastry?  Starbucks Siphon - this highly visial experience pairs full immersion and vacuum filtration to create a nuanced cup.  We literally watch the boiled water move from the bottom to the top mixed with the coffee (Tanzania coffee).  Afterwards, the coffee drips back down to the glass on the bottom. 

Time? If you don't have time, don't order it.  It took a good 5-10 minutes for the whole process to complete.  It was fascinating to watch the whole process.  Picture is a collage for the full effect.

Price?  It cost more than the typical coffee price.

Are you kidding me!! I demanded a do over. It was done though grudgingly! Probably could use some retraining but a quick fix would be to turn down the music.

The music is so loud that they cannot even hear you over the noise. I bet if the the music was turned down to a reasonable volume the customer experience would be much better.

I expect this is a spot that gets a lot of tourists so it is even more incumbent to give out of town visitors a proper NYC experience. Come on people you could do better"

I used to bea Starbucks regular until I've had some pretty poor experiences in NYC. The staff seem to only care about you if you tip them $2+ no matter the size of your order. Also don't talk or ask the cashier any extra questions because the rest of the staff will be super rude and start yelling next, next. 

Just be really order and go NYC style and don't request for an order adjustment if you want the nice average NYC Starbucks experience.

I really like that they have huge touchscreens near the front entrance where you can take selfies with a timer. Unfortunately, none of the screens work properly so you are unable to use the keyboard screen to type in your email address to receive the photo that you spent the last minute cheezing hard for. Nevertheless, it's still better than Universal that if you want to keep that photo then you can take it with your camera as nobody can be bothered to fix broken equipment in the Big Apple.

The result is a loud, massive, airy coffee emporium with lots of seating that's perfect not just for clandestine business conversations but also as a pit stop for the hordes of tourists who frequent Times Square these days. Definitely a huge step up from typical, run-of-the-mill Starbucks fare."
1013,starbucks-reserve-new-york-5,2019-06-13,1.0,"Partly due to location, place is loud, crowded, service slow, and the staff unabashedly rude... mobile orders take 10-15 minutes to process. Waiting area for online orders is by two trash cans, and the online orders are hidden from customers... very perplexing..."
1013,starbucks-reserve-new-york-5,2018-11-21,1.0,This place is too busy for the staff to handle.  Waited 45 minutes for a peppermint mocha ( along with 50+ other angry patrons) with me pestering them for my order for the last 20 minutes.   Total cluster F***. Don't go to this location.
1013,starbucks-reserve-new-york-5,2018-11-15,1.0,Don't got to this Starbucks! It was horrible. It took 30 minutes to get a latte. Starbucks should close it down.
1013,starbucks-reserve-new-york-5,2017-04-15,4.0,Roomie Starbucks with a place to stand and not be in anyones way.  They really can move a line and serve the masses.  Limited tables if you are lucky to get one. Friendly helpful staff.  My favorite they carry a gluten free breakfast sandwich.  Wrapped in plastic to avoid cross contamination.  Just was over joyed to be able to get something with my coffee.  Almond and soy milk for those who can't have dairy.  Coffee is strong just like I like it.   Window ledge to sit on and people watch.  Right in the center of Times Square across from the gathering place where all the characters hang out to attract tourists to take pictures.  Always a show to watch.  So my point is grab a late' and enjoy.  Best view unless you are sitting right in the crowd.
1013,starbucks-reserve-new-york-5,2019-04-13,2.0,Not very satisfied with this Starbucks.  I ordered a venti mocha and the cup was half empty almost.  Might as well have ordered a medium or small.

Also told us we couldn't stay in because we weren't current customers. His name is marysol or something like that and I have been a customer there for a long time and have NEVER witnessed anything like that EVER. I will not be going back. 

Calling corporate today. After he found out who I was he wanted to be fake nice and try to give me free stuff but I gladly declined. DO NOT COME HERE.

1013,starbucks-reserve-new-york-5,2017-05-03,4.0,Starbucks has become a brand for excellent coffee but  it does not mean that the drink is prepared properly. I was not happy with latte in other starbucks spots but HERE they make it perfectly! Thx to staff! However i put 4 stars instead of 5 only because they do not have plugs to charge my smartphone.

1014,knave-new-york,2019-08-31,1.0,"The decor is beautiful, and the seating is relaxed and classy. Definitely a unique and seductive environment. However, this place has me wondering if this place is purely out for people who have more money than sense. I started genuinely wondering if high class was somehow synonymous with stupid. Or is it guilt? Does one simply sit down, tickled with the anticipation of a menu that matches the grandeur of the walkway, see the menu, and feel obligated to get a least SOMETHING once the initial paralysis of shock and horror has subsided? 

I mean, a cocktail featuring Jameson for 23 . . . ARE . . . YOU . . . MAD?"

Be aware that seating near the exit has a lot of harsh lighting coming from outside which I didn't like.  Totally took away from the ambiance.  I asked to be moved and they accommodated us with a different table very quickly.  

Very good service and nice cocktails."

1014,knave-new-york,2018-12-05,5.0,I love the Decour with the Moroccan feel 25foot ceilings .The drinks are expensive but you get exactly what you ask for and stuffed olives and nuts make it all worthwhile. It's my go to place after screening movies at the Directors Guild next-door.
1014,knave-new-york,2017-11-06,2.0,"I've always liked this place in spite of the $30 glasses of bad wine.  It used to be dark and sexy, the service was classy and attentive.  The last couple of times we've come here, it's cold, careless and sad.  It feels as though it's under new management and the clientele has morphed into loud, tacky tourists.

We arrived both times and there was nowhere to sit.  The last time we were there a couple of weeks ago, we ended up sitting on the far end near the outside door.  It took nearly ten minutes for a server to greet us and when she did, she was short with us and when we tried to order food with our drinks she looked annoyed and let us know it would be 15 minutes before food would arrive.  Uh....why?  She also told us she would be leaving and another server would take over our order.

A better table popped up near the other side of the bar, so we moved there.  We let the new server know and 15 minutes passed.  In desperation, my husband walked to the bar to check on our drinks as our server was nowhere to be found.  Mind you...the original server was STILL there.

She admonished my husband for not waiting for her to arrive with the drinks.  At that point, we kind of gave up.  Her attitude was terrible.  The manager arrived and apologized and said she would take the drinks off of our bill. The one bright light was that the drinks were actually pretty good (not wine).

Alas the bill arrived and the drinks were still on the check.  They had removed the much less expensive food items.  Nice. 

Not sure I'll go back."
1014,knave-new-york,2018-02-06,3.0,"Cocktails are between $23-27 so be ready to drop some change. Beer is also expensive but that's the price to pay for the atmosphere that the bar provides. 

It's not so much as bar as it is a narrow path between two halls/entrances, strategically designed to give it a much more spacious impression. 

Hues of dark red, with specks of warm chandelier lighting make it perfect for dates, not so family friendly haha

To be honest I thought it would be a larger venue but I liked their couches anyhow. Probably will not return, mostly bc the drinks are exorbitantly priced...even for midtown."
1014,knave-new-york,2019-02-10,1.0,"Stopped by the cafe. Dim and dramatic looking. All was well until I appreciated two dead flies in my glass of cold brew. Server took it away with no reaction and then for some reason returned with a to-go cup of iced coffee that I had not asked for. Then she tried to bring us a check when we were about to leave, apparently not considering that wild sanitation violations might be cause to consider otherwise. Thankfully the manager was appropriately horrified by this whole situation and reacted appropriately by waiving our tiny check (only other item was a cappuccino, since they forgot to bring the pain au chcolat I ordered). Not sure what else you need to hear to know that you should check out somewhere else."
1014,knave-new-york,2018-12-19,5.0,"After being on our feet all day we were in desperate need of a place to RELAX and just grab some coffee maybe a cocktail. If all my needs and wishes created a physical atmosphere, this was it; It was dark, cozy, warm, had swanky jazzy music playing and offered cocktails beer tea and espresso drinks. A bit pricy with $15 beers but totally worth it."
1014,knave-new-york,2018-11-03,4.0,"Pros: cool interior, good music. Cons: hard to find. 

Interesting lounge with decadent interior and comfy chairs. It's not easy to find (no street sign) and it's not too busy. The staff isn't pushy, it's a good place to enjoy a few drinks not far from Central Park."
1014,knave-new-york,2018-09-05,1.0,"$5+ for a plain cup of coffee and they can't even give you a lid that doesn't fall off and burn you.

The coffee bar is very swanky with a long hall from the entrance to the other end where the hotel reception is. 

The barista was friendly and knew a lot about coffee. While the tea and coffee were more expensive than other traditional coffee houses ($8 each for coffee or tea) the quality was so much better. Knave is located in an upscale hotel. 

If you enjoy a wonderfully brewed latte this is the place to be."
1014,knave-new-york,2018-11-21,5.0,Good place and atmosphere. Service is good. Good taste on my latte. It has a complementary snack with my latte.
1014,knave-new-york,2018-11-06,5.0,Great flat white and exceptional ambience. The Parker hotel has such great architecture and atmosphere for having a morning beverage.

The service is non-existent. You have to ask for someone to come. You have to ask them to take your bill. They will not come back after the brought your drinks. 
The coffee actually isn't that good which is the order part. You want a place like this to have amazing coffee and it just doesn't. They also have parfaits and other collections of stale fruit. You walk in wanting this place to be amazing but nothing here is. Also overpriced. Two iced coffee with tip will run you 20 bucks.."

1014,knave-new-york,2017-02-12,5.0,"This opulent mid block walk through is also The Parker Meridiem lounge\bar. How do you make a walk through one of the best hotel bars in the city?
You do as they have done. Start with an architect of vision, add attention to detail and merge it all into a public city space. 
It will cost you $50 for a pre or post concert (Carnegie. Hall is just 3 doors away) drink for you and yours but it is well spent. Heavy crystal tumblers and a small carafe of tonic make a simple drink into a luxury indulgence. 
Peanuts to munch on? Yes and no.
They go far beyond. Each table is provided with a spicy peanut, some ordinary mixed nuts and some warm, breaded olives. 
Although we had none, as the coffee being served several tables up passed by, it was clear that this also was perfected.
This is a must stop when around 57th."
1014,knave-new-york,2017-02-18,4.0,"Went here on a lame Tinder date..... the location (Knave) was great.....and I will def be coming back, hopefully for a better date next time. The price is def city pricing...... but the atmosphere is superb and high class"
1014,knave-new-york,2015-12-08,2.0,"Located inside the hotel, Knave admittedly has an incredibly unique interior.  Entering its nook is like setting foot inside some Gothic cathedral.  But I'm uneasy about overly quiet spaces, and this one was practically as silent as a tomb.  For such high prices, the coffee options were extremely limited.  And the barista certainly turned his nose up at me when I asked for vanilla in my latte.  It's definitely the ""we don't wish to serve artificial sweeteners of any kind - how dare you"" kind of vibe.  

If the caffeine choices are slim, then call the food items severely slim.  I got stuck with a dry, possibly day-old (?) chocolate croissant, but ended up stealing bites of my mom's blueberry muffin: moist, with an unexpectedly pleasant tang.  

Maybe it'd be different if Knave was the place around for miles, but NYC is practically a breeding ground for coffee spots.  Overall, probably not worth your time and $$."
1014,knave-new-york,2018-02-18,2.0,"This cafe acts as a passage way between the Avenues. It isn't a good workplace as people are constantly rushing through. Many businessmen having meetings as well. 

He hostess and bartender were not very friendly, almost sarcastic and pretentious. The menu is limited and the coffee is not very good. 

People are drawn here due to the pictures of the high ceilings, etc, however, in person you will be disappointed."
1014,knave-new-york,2016-08-12,1.0,"Undoubtedly the setting snd decor are beautiful but we were sitting near the door and the foot traffic was horrendous. It took away from the experience. 

Not long after being seated I felt as if I was being bitten. Luckily my friend had some repellent that I applied, which helped. 

After I got home I discovered over twenty mosquito bites on my back! Not what you expect in a interior hotel bar of this caliber. 

I found the prices too extreme. Cocktails at $21 and up are to be expected. But wine at the same price is a rip off.  Drinks are cheaper at roof top bars in the city and they come with spectacular views 

The only two redeeming qualities about the evening were my company and the lovely waitress who gave us extra olives!!!  I won't be back."

1014,knave-new-york,2016-11-06,1.0,"Not only is it a business operating in a public space that discriminates against people with a normal income, but they charge you $20+ for mediocre cocktails made with muddled rotten fruit. Also you are paying astronomical prices for sub par products in an environment that is not only infested with vermin like roaches and mice but a mismanaged team of people who only care about themselves than about the guests experience. They don't clean the glassware, the $22 glasses of wine always have lip stains- gross! Personally I only like to pay for quality. I was a former employee as Steven P. Has pointed out, but I am not guilty of low quality because I have and always will have high standards which were not appreciated what so ever during my employment which is a whole another review on Glassdoor isn't it?!  The bad service I am referring to occurs mainly amounts your lazy over compensated entitled night staff PIPES. I'm just telling the truth NYC I'm an honest person so whether you like it or not I'll always tell the truth."

**1st Time**
Sis, cousin and me went here for a night cap after all our arrival in the city. It was their last call but thankfully they allowed us to stay. I ordered the ""Big Apple Sidecar"" and man, that drink was NO JOKE. First sip, took me out of my element. Definitely made me sleep that night!

**2nd Time**
Friend and I came here to get coffee, to refuel for the pending MET museum. That was definitely a good call since their soy mocha was well worth it! It was creamy, well made, and I was a fan!

1014,knave-new-york,2018-05-17,2.0,"Prior to attending a matinee at City Center, I decided to treat myself. Knowing this place's reputation for both good cocktails and high end espresso, figured I'd get a proper, traditional Irish Coffee served in a nice tall glass with a layer of heavy cream on top. To my great disappointment, I was served an oversized regular (and mediocre for that matter) cup of coffee with no cream, and a cordial of whiskey/Bailey's on the side. Didn't taste right at all, and was certainly not the experience anyone is looking for when ordering this drink. I'd keep my lips tight regarding this matter if not for the fact that, not including tip, the charge for this cheaply executed and disappointing drink came out to a ridiculous $22 and change. When I brought this matter up with the staff, who were thoroughly gracious, they informed me that they are aware of this issue but that management has instructed them to serve this drink this way and that they will not listen to them. Therefore, I'm hoping that management will listen to me here when I say you shouldn't assume that you know better than what the public wants. Would give one star if not for the fact I don't want the workers to receive much in the way of flack. You can't fault folks for doing what they've been told. However, they have been told wrong, and until you start serving proper drinks that are in line with atmosphere you market, and steep prices you charge, I will not be returning and will urge others to stay away."
1014,knave-new-york,2015-12-03,1.0,"As a platinum SPG Member I contacted the SPG Platinum concierge to reserve a table which I've don't multiple times before. The f&b manager ""Celine"" offered to hold us a table if we came at 6 (30 minutes before our intended time) which we did and Celine failed to let anyone working after she abandoned ship know this, yet held 3 of your tables for a party of ""30"" that as we saw and was confirmed by the Knave staff never materialized. So clearly you're not very business savvy.

I have been a repeat guest of Knave (and Normas) and Mister Redlinger used to reserve tables for us at Knave. I don't expect to be treated as worse just because you have staff has turned over. I spent over $400 tonight.. As I always do.

You have a reputation for treating SPG's best customers terribly (see Yelp, tripadvisor, flyer talk), a fact which you proved to be true tonight.

Thank goodness our waitress Debbie was a diamond in the rough and was very pleasant because your front desk and F&B staff are terrible and shouldn't be allowed within 100 yards of a customer.


Really disappointing treatment of a loyal repeat customer, Platinum SPG member, lifetime Gold member.

You've really done yourself a disservice. It won't be forgotten and the 5 affluent tastemakers we were with aren't shy about sharing their opinions.

Thanks for the awful service.

FYI beware of any reviews on social platforms of Le Parker Meriden or their restaurants or bars; the GM posts glowing five star reviews to boost her numbers. How unethical!!'"
1014,knave-new-york,2014-07-20,2.0,"Great location, atmosphere, drinks. Lousy service. Stopped by for a great Manhattan Saturday afternoon. Only a few people there, but the waiter acted as if he had better things to do than even look in my direction. Spent most of his time chatting with baristas/bartenders.  Finally condescended to deliver my check, but after about 15 minutes of trying to get his attention, gave up and walked it to the bar myself. Asked waiter for glass of water, and all he could say was ""ok,"" like he was doing me a huge favor. I don't expect or like obsequiousness, but for the price ($17/manhattan) and location, I expect better than being blatantly ignored."

Never ever go to this lounge it's awful!!!!"
1014,knave-new-york,2012-03-05,2.0,"Knave is more or less what you might expect from a nice hotel bar.  It's pretty and calm, with mediocre drinks priced like the swill of kings.  There's a reason I don't tend to seek out hotel bars.

Even so, I ended up at Knave for a round of drinks before dinner at the Burger Joint across the lobby.  It made geographical sense and the space was very nice.  I liked the casually ornate parlor vibe and the comfortable, ample seating.  Service was whatever.  We didn't order right away because we were waiting for a friend, and our waitress looked very suspicious of us. No nuts and olives until we ordered, and once we did, she seemed a lot less interested in checking in with us.

I took a look at the menu and had a decision to make - $18 cocktail or $9 Heineken?  On balance, I was more offended by the $9 grocery store beer, so I paid the higher amount on the off chance that $20 (more with tax and tip) could buy a good drink.

It turns out $20 at Knave gets you a run of the mill cocktail with average execution.  I had a Cucumber Collins with Hendrick's gin, cucumber, and lime.  It was okay.  The gin was there, and the cucumber was nice, but it watered down fast.  I also tried the Squeeze, with Absolut Kurant, lemonade, and Chambord.  It was sweet and easy to drink, but far too expensive for a cocktail that tasted like a Gummy Bear.

We munched on nuts and fried olives, which were at least complimentary.  They were easy to ignore, though.  I liked the thought of the fried olives, but they were so salty they were hard to eat.

Despite the lackluster overpriced drinks, I had a good time at Knave.  The atmosphere was pleasant, and we had no problems getting in or hearing each other talk.  I wouldn't come back unless it were extremely convenient, but I suppose there are worse bars in New York."
1014,knave-new-york,2009-02-08,4.0,"Perhaps it was my bad luck for it was not busy on a early Friday afternoon at 12:15pm because the service was ridiculously slow.  The service moved like a snail as I sat down for nearly ten minutes without being greeted.  I wanted a simple hot chocolate while I checked my messages on my phone before going to work nearby.  A simple drink like hot chocolate take an eternity to produce, yet notoriously pricey at $6.50.

Also, cocktail drinks are a disgustingly priced at $18.00 each for Cosmopolitan and Martini but the quality is better than Starbucks.  Classical music is played to serenade patrons while relaxing with coffee and a book, newspaper or with clients.

N.B.  Patrons MUST order a drink to be permitted access of the comfortable red velvet oak chairs or couches.  NO outside food or drink is to be consumed as Le Parker Meriden Hotel staff will eject patrons where visible."
1014,knave-new-york,2013-01-30,4.0,"Some of the best coffee in NYC.  
Over the last 6 months, this cafe has converted me from a snooty tea drinker (loose leaves only) to a casual espresso consumer.  There is something about the coffee - smooth without the sour tartness you get at some franchises.  Taste at Knave reminds me of the little cafes in Milano.  I always have it ""neat"" with no sugar nor milk.
The hot chocolate and cafe mocca is also to die for.  They use Real Chocolate, not the cheap cocoa powder.  
Then, there is the freshly baked Pain Au Chocolat - super flaky packed with the same dark chocolate described above. I get it all over my clothes eating it - it is that flaky!
Service: It depends. When it is good, like today, it is a solid 5 stars.  The food and ambience are 5 stars easy.  Overall, 4+ but I may revise this upwards at a later date.

Au revoir!"

I especially like their sushi counter & Korean food. Delicious, quality you'd expect to pay more for and reasonably priced.  Coffee bar is decent too."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2019-06-09,3.0,"MONA is a convenient place to grab lunch or a snack near the UN, but is terribly terribly overpriced. They have a variety of options, including a salad and hot food bar, espresso drinks, smoothies and açaí bowls, sushi, and made to order sandwiches. There is some seating but during peak lunch hours it can be pretty busy. 

I got a prosciutto sandwich and it was honestly not that good. Thankfully my boss was paying otherwise I would be super upset. The prosciutto was not really prosciutto at all, but rather thickly cut ham that was very difficult to chew and quite tough - I ended up taking it all off my sandwich and was left with fig spread, cheese, spinach, and tomato.

It did look like they had other good sandwiches and plenty of other things to try, but I'm just really turned off by the $10 sandwich that I didn't even like. It seemed like my coworkers were satisfied with their lunches, and I'll probably end up here again for another lunch meeting in the future, so we'll see."

1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-07-01,3.0,"MONA is just like any other New York deli or bodega with a hot self-serve buffet, only that it's nicer-looking from a decor standpoint and has a reasonable amount of seating even during the lunch rush (granted, it can get extremely hot inside even on cool days; fortunately there's a public outdoor courtyard with more seating nearby). 

As for the food, the buffet is a bit pricey even by New York standards, but if you stick to modest amounts of proteiny items like salmon or chicken as opposed to heavy (read: carb-laden) or watery (read: salad or veggie-oriented) items, you should be getting a pretty good deal. You can also pick up salads, sandwiches, and even sushi separately. 

Even if the prices are a tad spendy, this place makes up for them with a reasonably comprehensive selection, its reasonable amount of seating, and its clean bathrooms. A decent choice."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2019-08-31,5.0,Many healthy choices. The açaí bowl was excellent.  Great smoothie and fresh juice options. Coffee was good. Perfect for me. Bonus: outdoor courtyard next to building.
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2016-08-04,4.0,"Food-wise this place is pretty awesome! There's a hot/cold buffet style line-up which charges by weight, so if you're strategic you can get salmon/asparagus/sushi/Greek salad/octopus/whatever for like $6-7 (provided you don't eat much). It's great. The fish does sometimes still have bones in it randomly. Packaged food items are on the spendier side, but of higher quality (organic/non-GMO-ish stuff). 

Coffee stand: I ordered a cold brew and it was approximately 70% crushed ice (why?), 25% cream, and a splash of coffee. They don't let you do your own milk/cream (I'm not super picky but I used to be a barista and it's way beyond a normal serving or splash at the top). Only one size for iced drinks. 

Lemonade from the juice bar is SO GOOD, and far more sour than sweet, perfect for a hot summer day. 

Employee yelled at me once for sitting on a ledge (which seemed odd because tons of other people were as it was raining and the place was packed). Whoops. Cashiers are some of the friendliest I've seen in NYC."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-08-23,4.0,"When I first walked by, I thought this was a fancy restaurant with ""outdoor"" seating. I was surprised that this was a buffet, coffee, sandwich, and salad shop. The interior is very beautiful and elegant. This place will definitely visually impress someone without having to spend a lot of money. I only tried their sandwiches. The portions are large for a good price. The turkey and avacdo sandwich tasted very fresh and clean. I thought it could have a little more spices but it was still a pretty decent sandwich overall. I have tried neither the buffet, salad, nor the coffee shop but I will definitely come back!"
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-10-09,5.0,I dig this place. There's a great variety of food at the buffet and it's all pretty high quality. All their market stuff is pretty expensive and coffee is not worth the price but I've seen them have some specials on food in the afternoon and also with their sandwiches... usually its around $10.99/lb which is like $13 for an entree of pasta and salad so not THAT economical but still one of the few affordable options next to the UN. It's also very clean!
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-05-23,4.0,Really no place to eat it clean I had a turkey club with bacon excellent kind of expensive but that's what you expect on second Avenue by the UN
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-01-19,3.0,"Pretty standard lunch buffet. Albeit I'd stay away from the macaroni and cheese. As a southern man, that just didn't look appetizing. (Sorry I forgot to provide the visuals for that ‍). Everything I tried was decent: teriyaki chicken, shrimp fried rice, bass... I went to the lunch buffet during midweek. It was crowded, most likely because of a 50% off promotion that ends today (1/19). I imagine there will be still be heavy traffic, around lunch, when there's not the promotion. Similar to its competitor, Olympia which is nearby. Both restaurants near Grand Central and the United Nations. I'd be careful, however. The food is weighed and it can get expensive quickly. My light lunch cost nearly $13 before the discount. Which, can be okay here and there but if you're looking for a consistent lunch spot, this may not be the place for you."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-07-27,5.0,"One of my favorite places, especially in the morning when I am running late. They quickly fix the breakfast and hot coffee."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-12-21,2.0,Had a salmon sushi bowl. Had a funny chlorine smell and I got sick that night. Lesson learnt - avoid sushi in deli's. They just have so much of it and looks delicious. Their buffet is good though and they change the menu everyday
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2016-08-15,5.0,"Walking around Manhattan can get tough, until we decided to head East. People are nicer, everything is cleaner and fresh. 

Decided to try MONA after we saw a huge sign advertising their macadamia nut milk, so we got a latte. The latte was delicious and the milk was not super sweet (a struggle I have with almond milk at times). Moreover, the decor is beautiful and the service is amazing. The servers made us feel welcomed and were very informative!"
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2017-02-27,4.0,"MONA does have a clean setup and an organized layout inside - coffee LHS and food bar on the right. Probably because I came in early, I felt it so spacious and bright. It took them a while to get me my daily dose as they were just about to get their espresso machine ready, yet the cappuccino tasted good. Not La Colombe type of good but enough for a quick grab-n-go sort. Seems to be a great add into the east side of town as there aren't that many of deli choices. 

Currently they are having a +1 dollar coffee deal if you are buying their lunch from the hot bar."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2016-05-26,4.0,"This place is great and I am SO HAPPY this opened right across from my office. Their coffee is fantastic, and their food seems to be surprisingly well priced (something unusual for coffee shops in midtown east). This opening right across from my office means that I will be here more often than I should, but I'm glad that they have a really fantastic variety of foods and snacks for me to choose from.

The baristas here are also really fantastic and really friendly. Anytime I've stopped in, the people working the coffee counter are really kind and extremely helpful when I'm being indecisive. This was different from the sandwich counter where they just couldn't seem to get the register to ring up things correctly. I think once they work out a few kinks, this place will be golden and I'm glad to have it so near by!"
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-07-18,2.0,"I love this place because of its convenience and location but the prices are way too much. My ""iced coffee"" cost more than a latte. No way."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-12-20,5.0,Best place for breakfast near the UN. Dig the design and vibe. Prices are reasonable and portions rock. Next time I'll try the buffet.

1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-06-03,1.0,"Probably the least favourite lunch place near un. Food choices are lacking near un but still not worth going. It only looks so pretty. Food is substandard and pricey. 
If u have long lunch break and dont mind wasting ur time waiting for ur food to arrive, try this place. Otherwise please dont waste your time for mediocre food. I waited 20 minutes for spicy beef soup..."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-02-01,5.0,"I just happened to be in the area for a meeting and grabbed a turkey avocado sandwich. I have to say, I haven't had a decent sandwich in a while in midtown east area(feel free to let me know good spots). this is simply rated on the cool environment and the turkey avocado sandwich...but i recommend it for anyone near MONA."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-11-09,3.0,Nice varied food choices - both hot & cold.  Reasonably priced by weight.  Came for lunch mid-afternoon & entrees could have been a little warmer.  Lots of seating inside.  Quite a lot of drink choices.  Allows for healthy eating (or not!) depending on individual preferences.  A perfect choice for several people dining together w/ different opinions re: food cuisines!
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2017-07-12,3.0,"My daughter moved right across the street from this place and I had high hopes as everyone wants a great eatery next to their home.  The salad bar price was very high compared to the other nearby salad bars offering similar items, $10.95 vs the usual $8.99 per pound.  The food tasted nice and appeared fresh but the value for the food we got $15.49 for one person was definitely 3 star at best. 
 Their food containers are rather bulky and when I asked the girl if she was using the Tare deduction for the weight of our two containers she was clueless about it.  I explained that the law in NYC required her to deduct the weight of the container prior to weighing my food and she was starting the scale at zero instead.  Also I had two different size containers and the law sets a different deduction rate for the large container than the small and she weighed them both and charged me at the same time.  Her response, I'll ask my manager later if I'm supposed to deduct anything for containers didn't help us at all and is basically a $300 fine for first offender and $600 for second time offenders so I think MONA needs to train their employees.  If we do go in again I won't be so easy and will report to consumer affairs."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2017-12-14,2.0,This place is convenient if you work in the area but it's way too overpriced and the service has definitely gone down hill. What used to be friendly & smiling employees that worked here are now rude and unfriendly employees that never smile. What happened?
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2017-10-17,3.0,"I love coming here during my lunch break; it's really clean and spacious. Mona has a great open buffet (both hot and cold). Unlike other open buffets, Mona has really fresh and healthy options to choose from. I particularly love their salad bar! Be prepared to spend about $10-13 for lunch, which can become expensive if you eat here often but if you have limited lunch time and need something quick and satisfying, Mona is definitely your spot."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2016-05-26,4.0,"Located right across the street from my office, Mona has quickly become the top choice for me to get lunch or coffee. Apart from its convenient location, the interior design of this place is remarkable and creates a clean, organized and modern ambiance. I especially love its high ceiling windows through which I get to see pedestrians walking by while enjoying my coffee inside of the kitchen. 

There are a variety of choices for food if you come here for lunch. In addition, the food is priced fairly reasonably compared to that of a lot of other restaurants in Midtown East. All the food tastes extremely fresh and delicious, with special shout out to their sliced beef in the hot food section- super tender and flavorful- and freshly made purple rice sushi! 

I am super happy that such a great market has opened at my door step and I don't need to travel miles for good lunch food anymore :P"
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2017-01-25,4.0,"I prefer their food by the pound more than Olympia's...however, it's SO. DARN. EXPENSIVE! If you're not careful, you'd literally drop $25 for a lunch buffet. Overpriced as hell! They do offer sushi burritos and they're pretty decent. The sitting areas are always clean and staff members are friendly. The asian coffee boy is SOoooOOOOO sexy but he's slow so expect a bit of a wait if you're getting a latte during rush hours. But MONA over Olympia."

I liked the same one that I ordered the last time but today, I found the meal a bit cold, the beef did not taste fresh or good and the soup was cold.  I did not enjoy eating the bibimbop at all today."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-07-23,1.0,"The chef at the poke station scrubbed the last bit of salmon left to make my poke bowl, it was way  less than regular portion and it also didn't taste fresh. Definitely not worth the 14 plus dollars they sell it at."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2016-08-16,2.0,"This is a newer restaurant with a hipster like ambiance inside. They have a breakfast bar area and stuff that you could order individually as well ad a hot cold food bar. I had the hot food bar and it wasnt bad. However, they had no labels over what the item was and the staff didn't know. I grabbed a meat that I thought was pork but was lamb and I don't eat lamb. However, they were nice and let me get something else."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2018-04-16,2.0,"I go here because it is close, but the food is only so-so and overpriced for the quality. My main gripe is the service. The few times I have ordered takeout, it has taken 15 to 20 minutes. I can be through the line and out the door in that amount of time at most places in the area."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2017-01-22,4.0,"I primarily use Mona for coffee. Their drip is surprisingly good - they have decent beans - and a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The sandwiches are decent, but not too much different from your standard lunch station place. They also have salad bar, hot buffet, etc. And a somewhat random assortment of pricey interesting healthy-looking snacks."
1015,mona-kitchen-and-market-new-york,2016-09-28,4.0,"The natural light that gets into this quaint lunch spot is amazing - plus, the variety of food is awesome.  Definitely a great place to grab a quick bite or take a longer lunch."

- Love that I can get genuine Ethiopian Yirgacheffe whole beans by the point.
- Hate that they charge me $16/lb. for it
----
 - Love that it's in a convenient Grand Central Market location right near my work.
- Hate that they know they are convenient and can allow themselves to charge so much for coffee beans.
----
- Love that despite the issues in Africa, they still manage to have a great selection of African coffee available while Starsucks has to discontinue certain flavors.
- Hate that it makes sense to me to pay $16/lb. because I have heard about the issues in Africa. 
----
The only thing that I can do is shake my fist at them, but damn it they are so terribly good. They have the coffee I want... the coffee I need.... the coffee on which I refuse to compromise.  It's genuine.  It's fresh.  Damn them.  The bastards are good."
1016,orens-daily-roast-new-york-14,2019-01-22,5.0,Stopped in and pick up a pound of the Burundi Ngozi beans and it was really good.  The coffee is fantastic.  The coffee beans have a sweet and delicate body and I truly love these beans.  Pick up a bag and take it home and you will not regret it.
1016,orens-daily-roast-new-york-14,2017-12-06,5.0,"I was hoping to grab some ground cinnamon coffee and dash out of there but the man at the counter told me it is ground to order.  He was so nice that I actually decided to be patient and bring some home with me.  First of all, the cinnamon coffee is heavenly, secondly, the customer service is stellar.   I wish I had caught the man's name because he was super knowledgeable and we got talking about the Chemex coffee makers and filters (which for the record are sold online at the Oren's website for prices slightly lower than Amazon.  Their Chemex coffee filters are MUCH lower than the Amazon price).  The dude knew hi stuff and obviously enjoyed talking with customers.  Now that I know I can order more Oren's coffee online I am super duper happy!"

As others have noted, staffers are always friendly here, despite the bustling crowds making their way through the market during afternoon rush hours.  Recommended!"
1016,orens-daily-roast-new-york-14,2015-11-25,1.0,"The service is very poor.  They do not sell brewed coffee at this location, thus educated salesmen are an essential.  The price of regular product such as a chemex are often 10% higher.

1016,orens-daily-roast-new-york-14,2015-12-05,3.0,Oren's coffee is coffee at its best. I think I've been to every location over the years. This was my first (and last) visit to the Grand Central location. I am specifically referring to the young blonde salesperson whose disinterest and absolute lack of willingness to assist with selection were borderline offensive.
1016,orens-daily-roast-new-york-14,2016-09-23,1.0,No star.  There are only two times when I write reviews. One is when service is memorably fantastic. The other is when service is so terrible that it has to be memorialized for the greater good. The latter terribleness applies to Oren's at grand central market.  Staff cold apathy is a bad reflection of management and an indication that the staff couldn't be bothered with their job or with the products they sell. These apply perfectly to the afternoon staff at Oren's grand central market on this fine Friday afternoon. They don't even meet the most basic of customer service.  No warmth. No effort   The customer has to do the solicitation for their attention and half hearted service. Ridiculous. There are many vendors out there that can provide much better coffee products and they do it with a smile even if forced. A note to management: please train your front line staff on proper and basic customer service etiquettes.

The food is consistently fresh, options change seasonally (e.g. soup), and aside from the high price tag (normal for Rockefeller Center) and shrinking salad portions, Pret is a good bet for lunch or snack. Seating is pretty limited (around 7 seats altogether), but there's open space down the hall where you can grab a seat (or a place to stand) and eat."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2019-06-03,3.0,"I spent a couple hours at this Pret A Manger one rainy afternoon last month, first to see a friend who works on this block, then to sit around and charge my phone before heading to Queens to hang out with other responsibly employed friends who couldn't entertain me at 4:00 on a Friday. Two hours is probably too long to spend at a Pret or any comparable midtown chain meant primarily for people who work in the area and never linger for more than fifteen minutes.

It felt dreary on a rainy afternoon, just kind of wet and clammy and even a little bit dingy. The bathroom was in rough shape, though I guess I appreciated that I got access, when all I was doing was sipping a Diet Coke and reading on my phone. Really, it would be a jerk move to complain about this place at all if it weren't just one of many Prets, probably no better or worse than any of the others, and insensitive to Yelp reviews.

I stayed with friends in different parts of New York this trip, so I spent a lot of my visit wandering across three boroughs with a backpack and odd pockets of time to kill. I was happy to have a place to sit down on a rainy afternoon and make sure my phone didn't die before Google Maps delivered me safely to my next destination (I am helpless without GPS). Thanks to this Pret for the Diet Coke and shelter."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2020-01-25,5.0,I love Pret. I love their ginger shots. I love their oat milk lattes and I love that they have healthy vegan options. Come to L.A. Please!

UPDATE: I went for my usual ice coffee with almond milk and honey.  Due to having sensitivities to sugar and dairy. I notice they were out of the packs of honey to sweeten my coffee so I asked for the honey that the let me used from th bottle. Well not only was this guy who works there refused to give me honey but he was awfully rude and nasty letting me know giving me honey was NOT something they will be offering to me everyday.

My personal favorite is the Chicken and Bacon. Not crazy about the soup collection and the dessert options are a tad pricey. I like their Level-Up payment option."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2017-08-19,3.0,"NYC has an overabundance of Pret A Manger locations and this one can be considered my 'local'. Whenever I am pressed for time, unable to exit the building due to inclement weather or cannot conjure up any alternatives, this Pret is my go to spot for an eat at desk lunch or quick snack.

Are you ready to eat? Well, if you are and you stumble upon this location be prepared for an overabundance of tourists. (This is Rockefeller Center, after all, and the Top of the Rock observatory waiting area is perilously close.)

Tourists, check. Office drones (present company included), check. There are certain rush hour times when the buzz of activity can be overwhelming to the uninitiated. The uninitiated are simply those who haven't a clue as to what to grab and go with and spend an inordinate amount of time staring at the cases of food while the professional pret folks bob and weave around them.

And what can you eat when you are ready?

Sandwiches, salads and cups of yogurt are my usual items, with the occasional croissant or pain au chocolat. There was one legendary week where I recall having their tuna salad on a baguette for the majority of a five day stretch. Hardly proud of this, the baguette has an at times generous schmeer of tuna salad ( and at other times, inadequate) along with sliced cucumbers. No more, no less. A few bites later and I can devour one of these in less than five minutes.

Another sandwich I've had on occasion is the ham and swiss cheese also on a baguette. There are also hot sandwiches ready for grabbing as well.

The payment setup is always confusing as there isn't any clear line or queuing system. (Well, there is but it isn't obvious). Each individual cash register is a line but what happens is that one massive line forms and people then dispatch off to the next available register. (Which is a perfectly fine system). However, and I've heard this many a time while at Pret, customers are encouraged to line up in front of each separate register. Use this to your advantage and move to the register on the far left. It's almost always empty, except for a few of us in the know, and just beware the icy stares from those unaware of proper Pret queuing. 

There's not much space to eat at this location so you are better off taking the goods to one of the tables in the concourse or, pathetically, back to your job as a wage slave working for the man (or woman, to embrace the wave of equality that's the current fashion)"
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2019-05-31,2.0,"One of their wraps made my stomach reeeal upset, maybe because it was the end of the day and has been sitting out for a while? Regardless, i'm reluctant to go back."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2019-09-12,4.0,"I've been coming here fairly regularly the last 5+ years.  I really don't expect much service since Pret is a grab-and-go type place, but I was pleasantly surprised by the staff.  The service is generally very competent, friendly, professional, and efficient.  More than one time they have seen me looking for something and will proactively ask me if I need help and offer to look in the back if a certain product is missing up front.  Once I left my credit card there by accident and they were gracious and understanding when I returned later in the day frantically looking for it.  
I will often go out of my way to go to this Pret instead of the other locations because of the stellar staff.  
I'll note that it seems like they had some staff turnaround earlier this year.  While service has slipped a little since then, most of them are still pretty friendly so I'm willing to chalk it up to new hires still settling in."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2017-11-18,4.0,"My go-to breakfast spot. Download the app and get five free drinks (any size coffee, tea, or hot chocolate).

Service - Friendly, quick, and efficient cashiers.  I am usually in and out within 3 minutes.

Space - More of a grab and go place in the 30 Rock concourse location (minimal seating by the window area).

Breakfast - My favorite hot foods item is the southwestern breakfast burrito ($5.22 total). I alternate between the egg souffle and egg white souffle southwestern breakfast burritos."

They are on top of a huge volume of guests, and they motivate their staff effectively. I had a small mishap with my sandwich today, and the problem was corrected with speed and grace. Many thanks to the great staff!"
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2016-07-24,5.0,"A large Pret in the concourse level of Rockefeller Center with hilarious staff and a 10% discount if you can snag the Rockefeller Card! 

I love Pret's food, it's always fresh, interesting and high quality fast casual. But if you're visiting this pret you're probably like me and been to many others, so I won't sell you on the food. 

There are 2 things that distinguish this location. The first is the discount they give if you present your Rockefeller Privilege Card. 10% is not much but it adds up if you buy lunch here regularly like many of us office dwellers do! 

The second is that the staff is very animated. Hearing them burst into song is not unusual and to say they are friendly is an understatement. They really seem to take pride in their jobs which is so refreshing! 

Also, I'll never forget the day when Snooki walked by and the staff lost their minds and took selfies. Hilarious! 

Yay Pret!"
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2018-05-21,1.0,"Pret A Manger... I wish it didn't have to be this way... I really do. This is my second time here, and if you've read my previous review you will see that I gave this place the benefit of the doubt, and assumed the barista was just having an off day. But this time, I don't see a reason for an excuse... once again I got an almond milk latte and the guy turned around, pressed a button and then got on his phone. When I got my latte it was extremely hot, so hot that I couldn't hold it in my hand without a sleeve, I had to sit it down. When I smelt my latte I received a pungent aroma of burntness if that makes any sense to you. I tasted it and it tasted so awful. The coffee was so burnt I had to throw the entire cup away. I'm sad to say, I will not be back!"
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2014-06-21,4.0,"Casual dining fast food from London.  All focused on health and freshness. 

This locale is in the Concourse of Rockefeller Center, between 49th and 50th.  We stopped for a bite before going up to the 67th floor to Top of the Rock to get this view of Manhattan.  

The space is small, with a few tables along the wall, but the queuing was quick and easy.  Our salad was fresh, colorful and exactly what we wanted to calm the hunger without eating too much.  While there, the staff was constantly replacing the packaged meals and snacks, and the kitchen door was open allowing us to see them putting the dishes together properly.  

Pret A Manger (Ready to Eat), is the right place to go when desiring a healthy meal that does not break the bank.  It is one positive direction that fast food is going. I want to go along for the ride."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2018-08-16,2.0,"The food I purchased was delicious; however, the customer service was less than satisfactory. When the cashier rang me up at the register I could barely understand him because he was speaking so quietly despite the noise in the restaurant. I pod with a credit card and when the transaction was complete, he just stood there till I asked him if I need to approve anything? He shook his head and in a barely audible voice said no. I had to ask for a receipt as he offered me none. Customer service is 90% of the experience. Unfortunately Pret a Manger failed on this experience"
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2018-08-02,5.0,"This was my first time here. I was pleasantly surprised with the variety of sandwiches (hot and cold) as well as other snacks that they offered. We stopped in so that we could grab a quick bite and a refresher. I ended up getting the tuna panini with a side of jalapeño chips and a chocolate chip cookie. I enjoyed the panini, even though it was just tuna and bread- it tasted amazing! I settled for the green juice drink and I was not a fan of it. It tasted too much like celery even though it did have other fruits in it. The one downside is that I was looking forward to a latte and they ran out of ice and there was not enough seats. Although I feel like this should be expected in New York. I can't wait to try one of their other sandwiches!"

1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2014-11-09,4.0,"The basement concourse at 39 Rock where this Pret is located is a total zoo at lunch time.  I mean a total frickin' zoo.  Every place has a massive line and can be a bit maddening.  

Pret has a business model that fits places like this to a T.  We all know their deal, but with stacks of high quality, pre-made sandwiches in refrigerated cases that you can grab and go is pretty awesome in a place like this.  They have several registers going non-stop so you can be in and out in a couple of minutes.  I often get the roast beef, asagio, and arugula sandwich on baguette.  It is quite good.  I also recently discovered the popcorn.  Yup, popcorn.  I get the sharp cheddar and caramel corn flavor.  It is off the charts good.  Get it, you will love it."

1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2018-04-10,2.0,They should train the younger staff to be way more polite to the customers.  Muttering to yourself and acting snotty when a customer makes a polite request is not good.
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2018-08-27,1.0,"I wish I could give zero stars. I stopped in here this afternoon to get lunch. When I went to pay, I was told they don't take cash, so I walked out. The cashier delivered the message with such an attitude. She didn't bother to even offer an explanation or apologize for the inconvenience. Especially since I know all other locations take cash. 
As I walked out, the cashier next to the one that I went to stared at me with this dirty look. The look she was giving me, I could practically hear her sucking her teeth at me. 
So not only does this location not take cash (despite the fact that I've never had an issue paying cash at your many other locations), I get a dirty look for walking out. 
The manager of the Rockefeller center location needs to curb their employees' attitudes. Especially at this location where you get millions of tourists and business people. 
I am a frequent Pret customer. My apartment is walking distance to 3 of your locations where the staff has always been wonderful and courteous. But  rest assured, whenever I have friends/family/colleagues visiting NYC, I will tell them to avoid the Pret at Rockefeller center."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2016-08-23,2.0,"I have to say I was really excited to come here but I was unfortunately very disappointed. I was hoping this would be more like a panera where there food is prepared for you to order, not just premade and put in the aisles. I had the mozzarella chicken sandwich which was bleh. The bread was so hard and it wasn't flavorful enough for me. I also felt there weren't many options. The only thing I liked was the babychinno which is a little drink on the house. There was also almost no seating just one booth for 4 people, and the Ac was blasting cold on us. Never again."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2018-07-01,3.0,"Really enjoyed the tortilla soup and the chips, but the service was sub par. We came in 30 min before closing and they weren't serving anything that you order at the counter (like coffee). And all the chairs were up so we had to take our order to go. I get that they were closing soon, but it was a good half hour until then. They should be serving coffee (which is what they are mostly known for) until closing. The only worker seemed kind of annoyed that people were coming in as well."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2016-01-08,3.0,"This is, at best, a place to get good-quality food at a slightly higher price point. At its worst, the lines in the morning and during the lunch rush are absolutely crazed with both hungry customers and employees who first scream that there are all separate lines per register. Then, they simply call out ""Next"" without indicating who is actually next on their line. 

The cashiers seem to be taking on too many jobs, as some will take your order and call out to their peers for that iced coffee you wanted, or perhaps that latte. You're then left to wait for your order while the single person behind the coffee machine is left juggling 5 different coffee orders.

In the morning, I'm sometimes left waiting 10+ minutes for a coffee, even without a line! Their system is terrible, and there is too little communication going on between the employees. 

Furthermore, I even brought up this problem to Pret itself, highlighting that they might want to reorganize their line system. They were sorry and only offered me some free food upon my next visit, typical corporate response (which I did not take, because I honestly don't want to go, have to explain the situation, which may take up my entire lunch hour, if I'm unlucky enough) I honestly wanted them to change the efficiency of their system! For all our sakes.

A few weeks later, I returned, only to find their line system still the same as ever. Most of the customers are begrudging--like myself. If this wasn't right next to the elevator to go to the main floor of 30 rock, I would never venture inside. However, the 10% building discount also helps persuade me to give Pret another try.

The actual cashiers and employees couldn't be more cheery, and the food is usually pretty fresh (a salad may come with a few wilted leaves, but not that noticably), it's just the organization that is completely absent, in my eyes, and every New Yorker knows that each minute waiting in line definitely counts."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2016-08-11,1.0,"Second and a last time I visited a PRET A MANGER. In my previous review I pictured a sandwich with virtually nothing. Now its a Small Peppered Yellow Water instead of THAI CHICKEN CURRY. Its only water, pepper and curry. No chicken at all, no other ingredients, JUST HOT WATER. UNFU--EN BELIEVABLE. And they charge 4.59 for it. SHAME ON YOU, PRET A MANGER, YOU NOT PRET A MANGER, YOU PRET A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!"

Service is always a hit or a miss - there are some really friendly cashiers I love getting, and then some where I know I will have a sour interaction.

I like:
- shrimp cilantro wrap
- pulled BBQ chicken wrap (hot)
- thai chicken soup (have it more often please!!!)
- kale chicken salad
- free bread rolls w your meal
- croissant (not so healthy)
- green juice

I love that they list the calories and ingredients right near each item, so you can monitor your lunch intake. Good, solid lunch choice."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2013-08-04,4.0,"I only have one complaint here and I'm going to get it said at the outset: the standard cold sandwiches are too small and thin. Come on guys! Let's give a little. I know I'm doing my part by paying Lenny's prices for these sandwiches without getting Lenny's sized sandwiches, which I could easily get by walking twenty yards away. And I do. Even though I like the combinations that Pret comes up with, I also like the sandwich I design myself at Lenny's. If I go to Pret and get a sandwich I always feel like I need something else to go with it, like soup or salad, and that really starts to drive the price up. 

That said, the quality at Pret is great. My favorite thing here is the ham & cheese croissant they have in the morning. Absolute, unabashed heaven. Flaky, buttery and filled with delicious ham and melty swiss cheese. You cannot possibly go wrong with that croissant, or any of their croissants, actually. The hot case is stocked with all manner of tempting items.

Their soups are exceptional. I haven't tasted one here that I didn't think was perfect and a nice changeup from Hale & Hearty next door which can get a little monotonous. On the more substantial side are the grilled sandwiches at Pret, which I would definitely recommend.

The coffee here is middle-of-the-scale. Not the best ever, but also not dreck. I've ordered lattes and had them come out okay, depending on who makes it. Very nice, polite staff. Never had the slightest blip in service here or any negative experiences at all, with the exception of sheep-like people milling around somewhat aimlessly, not really knowing where the line is (for reference, each register has its own).

Pret has become a dependable lunchtime staple over the past ten years. I'm all about it."
1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2011-10-09,4.0,"I remember Pret A Manger when they first opened up in december last year in chicago. They came up with two outlets in downtown.It is always packed specially during the lunch time.

Now coming to the one at rockefeller concourse, well it carries the same menu as other locations do. I really like the exhaustive variety of sandwiches on display. There are a plenty of them to choose from. All the sandwiches are very reasonablly priced.  My all time favourites are Slim Chicken Avocado & Balsamic and Egg Salad Parmesan & Spinach.They carry some really good soups too. Staff behind the counters is always quick."

I usually go for half of their Roast Beef and Parmesan with Arugala sandwich on a baguette(290cal) and their Lentil and Couscous Salad Pot (100cal) on the side.

They also make a fresh batch of cookies every hour, great for an afternoon snack if you happen to catch them right out of the oven!"

Nicely laid out, a great selection focused on healthy dishes and high quality ingredients, and an assortment of items for not only lunch, but also breakfast.

The staff working there are consistently helpful and friendly, and compared to other fast food places, they seem to actually like their jobs and enjoy each other's company, which to me points right back to a good store manager who knows how to hire good people and keep them motivated and happy."

This was the ONLY place open at 9 p.m., so I was very appreciative because I was so hungry. The sandwiches and soup seemed to be pre-made so I picked up a roast beef sandwich and a bag of chips for $10, not too bad considering the time and location. The sandwich was really good, sometimes they tend to get soggy when they're pre packaged but this one was perfect. The guy at the counter was really nice, especially considering how late we came in. I highly recommend stopping by here for a quick snack as its the only place open!"

1017,pret-a-manger-new-york-7,2013-02-26,3.0,"Pret A Manger has both more and less food than you'd think.  If you want something warm, it's either soup or a pastry.  But if you want something cold, there are lots of options.  

I got a soup (Skinny Veggie?) that I greatly enjoyed, as well as a yogurt parfait cup (plain yogurt with honey, bananas, and almonds) that was totally eh... just really bland.  I also got a bite of a sandwich and a taquito-type thing, which were both good but not wow-worthy.  

Awkward seating options, and few seats overall.  A strange lay-out of the store with too much empty space and not enough food or seats.

Still, a reliable meal or snack.  A place I'd go back to in a rush.  With more than a few minutes, I'd find something local and delicious."

Ordered a latte and it came out way too hot...

The bacon and egg wrap was mediocre as the wrap was rather hard from being in the warmer for too long..."
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2019-12-19,3.0,"Chosen for its location (steps away from our event venue) and quick-serve menu, this Pret served as our go-to stop for snacks, non-coffee drinks and grab-and-go lunches.  I opted for a tomato basil soup and a Greek salad the only time we had an actual meal here. I wouldn't recommend the salad, but the soup was appropriately tangy and hot, which was perfect for the weather.

The girls at the counter seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves than ringing up the long lines of customers queuing up. I do know that most of my group ordered coffee drinks from this Pret once, and once only. None of them liked the drink they ended up with, which meant that most of the drink went to waste. 

Still, they were close and open when we needed them, offering an option to staff not willing to walk several city blocks to find something different."

1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2019-03-25,3.0,"I went here once for an iced chocolate (medium) at night and another time for an avocado toast during breakfast. The service was efficient and staff was friendly. 
However, there was nothing really outstanding about this place. I didn't know what to really expect when I got the iced chocolate but I was still somewhat disappointed when I found out it tasted just like chocolate milk. It was a sweet drink but I couldn't help feeling I could have just bought chocolate milk for cheaper for the same taste.
I was looking forward to my avocado toast because let's face it, it's the millenials' choice for breakfast. But I was disappointed with the stale toast. It got better in the center when there was avocado. However, then the avocado toast became spicy - there was a lot of pepper flakes on it. The avocado and the pepper flakes did not mesh well; I like the avocado's creaminess and I like spiciness of pepper but not together. 
I personally think I didn't get the popular choices they offered and that's why my times at this cafe was mediocre at best. If you are at this cafe, try their more popular items."
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2018-11-18,4.0,"The food quality of food selection here is pretty similar to all the other Pret a Manger locations. There is seating inside and outside and it's a bit tight but good enough given it's location within the theater district. 

Coffee, salads, and sandwiches are self serve off the shelves and counters and the pastries are behind the counter with the cashier. They were out of almond croissants when I went at 6pm which was understandable (and is the same situation at other locations I've visited) but if they're so popular, why don't they have more at hand (just thinking out loud)? 

They need better line management here. Since there are no stanchions or markings, people just make up their own line procedures and end up cutting customers who have already been waiting, which was extremely frustrating. I can't imagine what the situation would've been like at a busier lunch time rush."

He gave me my large fennel tea on the house, and when I went back to get a meal, he gave me the most entertaining yet informative rundown on all their salads, soups, and sandwiches to help me decide what to get. When I went to check out, I watched him track a woman down because she forgot her credit card in the machine. Now that is customer service, and it's something you can always count on Pret for. 

My fennel and mint tea was refreshing and exactly what I needed to relax me late at night. Also got the Moroccan lentil soup, which was great. I love that Pret has all calorie and protein counts for each item. Their meals are cheap and healthy, and their service is pretty top-notch."

1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2018-12-18,4.0,"This is a great, convenient pit stop for people who want to get a quick bite to eat in Midtown but don't want to pay through the nose. It's still a bit too pricey for my taste, but that's unavoidable when you're in this part of the City. Relatively prompt, efficient service. Decent, but not exceptional cleanliness. The only downside is that they have locked, key punch activated bathrooms, which I loathe."
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2019-09-29,2.0,"They do a good job with the food at Pret, you can count on fresh, healthy and clean here. But the whole purpose of grab and go is speed. The service here is soooooo slow. Today there was one person on the register and a bunch of people working behind the counter doing not much that was visible. The woman at the register took five minutes to ring up one customer with the big order of two beverages.  Train your staff better please."

The whole staff is friendly and swift with service . Also , I would like to mention the consistent exceptional customer service from Shaunte . She always is smiling and gives a warm welcome to each guest . Keep up the great work !"
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2019-08-08,5.0,"My family and I stopped in here yesterday for a quick bite, as it is a staple place for us to eat when we have a limited amount of time before a show. We know that the food will be good, and the service will be fast. Although we have consistently had positive experiences at this particular location, I feel compelled to write about our experience yesterday. The food was great as usual, but the incredible service and positive presence of the staff was truly wonderful. One worker truly caught our attention, as she had such an amazing smile and a wonderfully positive attitude. In addition to providing friendly service when we bought our food, she was coming around to the different tables and cleaning them off. I complimented her on her positive attitude, and she said, ""You see, I'm from Virginia. What I realized after moving here is that the city of New York is in danger of losing their smiles. Unfortunately, smiles are becoming an endangered species around here, and I am doing my part in making sure that doesn't happen."" This fabulous woman's name is Shaunte. Despite the thunderstorm that was raging outside, there was definitely sunshine in that place which had so much to do with her. Thank you Shaunte and company, and keep shining!"

1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2019-05-05,5.0,"Stopped by here on my way to a meeting and needed a little pick-me-up. The exterior of this place caught my eye, and I figured I'd check it out. Upon entering, I noticed there was ample seating for people who wanted to order buy food/coffee/drinks and sit there to eat. I wasn't in the place for too long because I was in a bit of a hurry, but I ordered a chai latte, assuming it'd be like the basic chai lattes served at Starbucks. Boy was I WRONG (in a good way). Now, I'm a chai afficionado and brew my own chai with the spices and everything at home whenever I get the chance, and let me tell you, this chai latte I tasted here was AMAZING. It was perfectly steamed, you can taste all the spices (cardamom, ginger, etc)-- basically as authentic as you can get when it comes to the classic chai (latte). I highly suggest anyone who loves their chai to come give this place a try. You're never going to want to get a chai tea latte at Starbucks after trying the chai latte here!!!"
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2017-11-15,5.0,I stopped by this Pret on my way to a daylong conference at the RIU across the street. It was very clean and the lines moved quickly especially with it being morning commute hours. They could use a couple more tables to accommodate all of their diners. Their free wifi worked very well and was easy to access! Highly recommend their grapefruit juice!

1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2017-12-20,5.0,Pret-a-Manger is like McDonald's for health conscious people. I didn't realize how much I appreciate this chain establishment until their sandwich saved me from passing out after a long spinning work day. Literally a life saver. They really do use fresh ingredients like advertised on the packaging. This particular Pret deserves a special star because the cashiers are very sweet and have genuine smile. Also I have a huge crush on their almond croissant and chocolate hazelnut croissant very reasonably priced at $3 each. Somehow they manage to keep the pastries slightly warm in the glass display. The croissants have slightly crispy flaky crust with layers of soft interior. It's like fresh from oven goodness. You have to try one to believe it.
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2018-10-12,5.0,"While a simple cafe and eatery, their service is superb compared to others in the industry.

They actively check on seated customers to make sure they are having an optimal experience, and occasionally give out complementary food items.

Overall, this Pret A Manger has offered a pleasant and calming environment in the middle of a hectic city, and for that they are optimal."
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2017-07-10,5.0,"I already loved this chain but loved it even more after my experience with AJ today! He was very attentive and offered me exceptional service, all while cleaning his work station with the rest of his team. The iced teas here are the best and all items are budget priced so check it out. 

Thanks again AJ!"
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2019-01-31,5.0,"Perfect lunch spot. I had the tomato soup and a croissant. Best tomato soup I have ever had. So fresh and the feta in it put it over the top. The croissant is also probably the best I have ever had (and I love pastries!). This place far exceeded my expectation in quality! Also, take time to learn about their operations, very cool! Everything is made small batch and rolled out throughout the day. At the end of the day, they donate the extra food rather than throwing it out."
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2017-04-15,4.0,I do love the fresh tasting sandwiches here. Service is quick and pleasant. My favorite is the chicken and avocado sandwich.

1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2018-06-03,5.0,"They use grass-fed organic milk! Such a rare find. Organic coffee is everywhere nowadays but most places cheap out on the milk. Which is super lame since a flat white or cappuccino actually has more milk than coffee in it! This place is a gem for not only following through on the details others ignore, but for having super patient, genuinely nice, people working there. I'll be back for sure."
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2017-04-17,4.0,"After 2 full days in New York of eating junk food from morning until night, this place was exactly what I needed without the wait. Fresh, prepared, organic foods with a variety of sandwich choices, salad choices, yogurts, fruit, coffee drinks, juices, etc. I had a turkey with avocado sandwich and their greens juice which was very decently priced, refreshing, and tasted good. I loved the fact that instead of throwing leftover food away at night-they give it to those in need. Nobody who sat down to eat took very long, so seating seemed scarce but really wasn't. Definitely try if you want some fresh, quick, healthy options."
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2017-07-30,2.0,"Two stars: To highlight a single really disappointing experience at a typically great location.

I go to this Pret often on my walk to work. When I work the morning shift, I usually have to be in at 8am, meaning I'm out walking at 7:30-7:45am. I have never had issue and usually find this location to be clean, well-stocked, and the service quite good.

Today, I entered the store at ~7:40am. I was in the store for a few minutes trying to pick something out. A few workers were standing around and no one said anything. Then a family walked in behind me and someone came out from the kitchen and told they weren't open yet. Though confused, I did walk out to look for the posted hours, but there were no signs posted at either entrance. I opened my phone and checked both Google Maps, then again the company's website and they all said the same thing. The store opened at 7am.

On a whim I stuck my head back in the door and asked a woman behind the counter what time they opened, she said 8am. I pointed out to her that everything I'm looking at says 7am. She stared at me for a moment and then walked away into the kitchen. 

Needless to say, I was disappointed. I worked counter-service at a bakery for almost two years and I totally get that things happen that could cause you to need to open later. Ovens break, people call-out sick, etc. I wished there had been some transparency or at least signs posted. There were workers present and there was food stocked. I don't really understand why they were not open.  

Thankfully, there is an abundance of Prets in midtown and I had left early enough to hustle over to 39th and 7th where I found an open store and excellent service."
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2018-05-20,1.0,"Horrible.  I thought it was impossible to mess up a grilled cheese sandwich. That proved me wrong. Take a look. Stale, rubbery, with pieces of unidentified cheese and mayonnaise. Nothing was grilled. The bread was probably pan fried couple of days ago."
1018,pret-a-manger-new-york-74,2018-05-18,1.0,Popped in for a quick bite to eat. Wanted to get a grilled cheese. Waited in line as all five employees spoke with one woman about her order. Finally got up only to be told the Toastie press was turned off. At 5pm on a Friday. Then told we could wait ten minutes for it to heat up. Disappointed and frustrated. Why would they turn that off when they're open until midnight?
1019,ralphs-coffee-new-york-3,2019-12-22,5.0,My friend and I went to see the tree at Rockefeller Center and were in the mood for hot chocolate. We spotted the truck and headed there right away! I ordered a peppermint hot chocolate. It was delicious! They also added some latte art!

If you get used getting your coffee from Starbucks , well,  options are quite few less. Taste depends on what you get is just normal than average. With the view of the rink , you are paying extra . Touristy spot but we could use once in awhile."

The coffee is pretty  good and I gonna do a review  and when I look up Ralph I see it is Ralph as in Ralph Lauren.

We have needed something super cool like this in Rockefeller Center for a while. This is the perfect place to meet up with someone for a quick coffee. They have an outdoor sitting area with umbrellas as well. So you can grab a iced coffee, sit and relax for a while.

The coffee is delicious, the location is perfect and the people who work there are the kindest!! I have a small dog who was super thirsty and they gave me a cup of water for him! Thank you!

1019,ralphs-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-15,4.0,"I didn't know about this truck if my colleague didn't tell me about it. It's in a weird location next to the ice skating rink. The path itself isn't that wide so it feels a bit tight with a truck and people lining up. 

Very cute but scary at first to see a big big human sized bear in the driver's seat. I don't think this truck is meant for driving in. 

I just got a regular latte. It's what a latte needs to be. The espresso base can be a bit stronger but otherwise it's aight, not burned like Starbucks often is. The foam was smooth without feeling stiff/foamy 

Based on the cup sleeves it looks like this truck has something to do with a pink charity... breast cancer??"
1019,ralphs-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-19,3.0,"Not sure why this coffee shop has such high reviews. The quality was not as great as other options in New York and the prices were $1 higher because of the location.

Aside from the unique experience of ordering coffee from a cart in the middle of rockerfeller center, I don't see what the draw here is. 

I'm also not a coffee connoisseur so maybe I'm just a noob :)"
1019,ralphs-coffee-new-york-3,2018-11-09,5.0,"It was 5 star coffee all the way! 

A beautiful day at Rockefeller Center strolling around in the am, called for coffee first! Early fall in NYC is a delight. 

I knew Tom's shoes our modern  do good, do well business concept was selling coffee and combining a food and shopping experience. But here you have a Ralph's craft coffee cart!  From Ralph Lauren.

When fashion turns to food you get something a little more aesthetic than your plain ole cup of Joe! 
New Yorkers would never put up with bad coffee and Rockefeller Center is for locals and tourists alike.

Fast, very pleasant service, great products, I felt sorry I wasn't hungry enough to taste it all. I'll be back, for sure !
If you are the boss of the 2 people you see on that picture, that served me on sunday 7th, go get then a big fat raise, and make sure they stay on board. They are awesome !"

1019,ralphs-coffee-new-york-3,2019-06-15,5.0,"The decor of this place is amazing, you just gotta have to take a photo of the classic ralph lauren bear truck. Their drip coffee is strong, and keeps you running. Its made fresh and convenient for your needs. But no worries, there is different milks on the side as well as sugar if you need it. The service here is wonderful as well, the baristas know what they are doing and are so helpful. They are pleased to assist you and are open to any questions. 

The menu seems to be different almost every day. Sometimes they have cortado sometimes they don't. 

Other than that, this is so enjoyable and a great addition to Rockefellar center. I would love to come back to try their cappuccinos or even their scones.! 
I love this place"
1019,ralphs-coffee-new-york-3,2018-12-08,4.0,"Lovely place in the middle of Rockefeller plaza. I liked the exterior of the coffee truck. I ordered latte and it was delicious taste. I had a pleasure sitting and sipping my coffee while observing rushing people. Small minus- there was a a few selection of pastries or other sweet bites to coffee.
Anyway, just come and check this place. You will enjoy it!"
1019,ralphs-coffee-new-york-3,2019-09-12,5.0,"One of my favorite cups of coffee in this area. Usually get an iced coffee, black, or an iced red eye, black. Both nice and strong and satisfying. Service is always good, the servers are very sweet. Occasionally they get caught up making drinks for a dozen tourists n business bros at once so they've forgotten my beverage before, until reminded. Still can't really complain- solid service. You'll spend a pretty penny for your coffee and they ***DO NOT ACCEPT CASH*** but considering the area, it makes sense for the price and is worth it in my opinion. 

Plus it's a vintage bus driven by a giant legless teddy bear- c'mon now! 

Rockefeller Plaza does get crowded with slow moving photo-taking tourists but the Ralph's crew usually moves things along quickly...and you can usually find a lil table if you feel like sitting and people watchin while you sip your mud."
1019,ralphs-coffee-new-york-3,2018-10-24,3.0,Their prices went up in mid-October. $5 for a cappuccino. Really?? So not worth it. $4 cookies and muffins are expensive too. I wouldn't pay that much for cookies unless they're from Levain.
1019,ralphs-coffee-new-york-3,2019-06-18,3.0,Cute spot with outdoor seating and cookies that look tasty (haven't tried though).  Coffee not so good  :(
1019,ralphs-coffee-new-york-3,2019-04-07,5.0,Great coffee truck I found parked near Rock Center.  The cold brew was delicious and very smooth and the service was fast.  I also grabbed a cookie that was delicious.

Parked on the side of Rockefeller plaza overlooking the soon-to-be famous ice rink, the truck serves some of NYC's best coffee. With ample seating, this is a great place to grab a cup o' joe if you are a tourist (visiting the 30 Rock), a business person (working nearby) or a New Yorker wanting to enjoy Rockefeller Center."

It was so weak and disappointing that I had to throw it away after a few sips - and only two short blocks away. What a waste. On a positive note, the coffee truck itself and the setting in Rockefeller Plaza is adorable and a great photo opp. Unfortunately, all sizzle and no substance."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2019-08-29,5.0,"I love,love,love the Cupcake Cafe. My family has been buying their cakes and cupcakes from the Cupcake Cafe for over 20 years. I don't live in NY anymore, but any time I am in the area I head straight to the Cafe. They were creating buttercream masterpieces long before cakes had bosses or cupcakes went to war.

I was heartbroken earlier this year when I thought they had closed for good. I was so happy to hear they just moved uptown to 49th Street ( which was a good thing because the 39th street location was a bit dodgy tbh). I'll be back in NY this weekend and can't wait to stop by."

It was so beautiful, I cried just looking at it! Usually I am not a big frosting person. But one bite, and the buttercream frosting literally melted in my mouth and coated my entire mouth with creamy goodness. The cake was light, fluffy, and so moist. I have been meaning to come back here to order a small replica of our cake for our anniversary. It's so delicious and I am forever grateful it was a part of our special day."

1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2019-04-23,5.0,"I will preface this review by saying it will be written through the tinted lenses of nostalgia, but since I no longer live in the NYC area and see that it's still open and operating, feel absolutely compelled to write this. I first encountered one of their fantastic cupcakes back in the early 90's, when a friend had them catered in for a work party and recall being flabbergasted at how delicious and aesthetically beautiful they were. I used to go and pick up cupcakes and cakes for any very special occasion, and their recipients used to be floored at their beauty.
After a while, I left NYC and new cupcakes and bakeries captured my attention. I moved on, and since have forgotten this wonderful bakery. Recently, noticed some beautiful floral cake designs somewhere that instantly brought my memory back to the craftsmanship of Cupcake Cafe. I realize now how far ahead of the curve they were on the whole cupcake craze. I'm sad to see the cafe is closed, those beautiful cupcakes were a part of so many wonderful memories."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2016-02-24,2.0,"Such a strange, awkward place.  Their cupcakes look cute.  And it seemed busy.  With newspapers stacked atop their iPad computer terminal, and a funky Santa Claus-esque cashier, this place really turned me off.  With an espresso machine that ""doesn't serve lattes"" and a selection of teas that doesn't have a menu, it can be a challenge to order anything in the front section of the ""cafe."" When I asked what teas they had, the cashier didn't really seem like he wanted to serve me or tell me what they had.  At least in the back where they keep the cupcakes, you can see what you are considering ordering.  

While they have plenty of seating and free wifi, the wifi is painfully slow and there wasn't an electrical outlet in sight.  If you can avoid this place, avoid it.  

For other coffeeshops in the neighborhood: FIKA is around the corner at 41st and 10th - you'll have a better experience there.  Kahve, another local coffeeshop, is on 52nd and 9th.  Cupcakes I can't speak for, although they look pretty.  Needless to say, there are many better cupcake bakeries in NYC...Billy's Bakery is just down the block in Chelsea near 21st and 9th. Worth making the short trip to avoid this place."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2015-12-12,4.0,"The cupcake cafe was doing their thing way before the trend to open cupcake shops began! When I worked at 9th (in the 30th street area) I passed it everyday on the bus. I had to go in for a sample. 

The secret of their longevity is specialization. They know what they do well and stick with their one specialty. If you want a cake for a special occasion this is the place to go. Your cake will be a one of a kind made to order special treat. It will also be delicious. 

If you just want a sample of what a cake would taste like, you should go in for a small cup cake. I go in for the small cup cake when I'm in the neighborhood. Be aware they are very sweet!"
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2016-01-21,5.0,"Love this little hidden spot. Its so easy to miss when passing by, but after stepping in Im always welcomed by the familiarity of its cozy interior (the gruffy lumberjack santa ish barista helps too). He's super nice btw. 

Their coffee is yummy (La Colombe) and most importantly, their cupcakes are fucking amazing. The only reason I trek out to Bumfuck, 9th avenue is for these holy cupcakes. 

Beautiful frosting artwork + sweet but not too sweet just the riiight amount of sweet cupcakes = shut up and take my money/caloric input."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2015-07-14,3.0,"If I were simply rating the cupcakes, this place would get 10 stars. They are so sinfully delicious but you won't care...you'll just repent at the gym later. Their maple walnut is my favorite and downfall. 

I've been consuming CC cupcakes for almost 20 years, using my children as an excuse to drop by their original location (39th st) for an after school snack back, in the 90's. I even found myself taking my kids to the bookshop that just so happened to house the Cupcake Cafe in Chelsea. All our family celebration cakes were CC cakes. Obsessed. 

A little change in lifestyle kept me away from the CC for a few years...until last month when I thought I'd buy cupcakes to share with my close family and friends. I entered their current location, very close to the original one in the Port Authority area...my hood. So much happy anticipation only to be thwarted by an unhappy ambiance with an even unhappier staff. In all fairness, the original spot was nothing to write home about but it certainly had better energy...a happy one that matched the cupcakes they were so famous for.

The guy at the front was so rude, and looked like he was in need of resuscitation. I think I interrupted his morning snack time since he threw my credit card back at me. Yes. Threw. God forbid, he leaned 5 degrees over to hand the card back to me. 

Why would I ever expect a ""thank you"" after spending $60 on cupcakes from this rude lump on a log? 

Ugh. Get your act together CC, and clean up a little...you've got a good product here and some pretty loyal customers who want to see you around for another 20...you can start with nixing the bad attitude. Have one of your cupcakes that ought to cheer you up."

1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2015-11-02,3.0,"Stopped in for dessert after walking around NYC in the afternoon. They have amazing frosting creations and decorations! Almost too good to eat! That being said, the cake itself was a bit dry and the frosting perfectly creamy without being too sweet. Come here for the beauty but there are probably better cupcake shops nearby."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2015-01-31,4.0,"Came here before my yoga class since I was in the neighborhood, this is my first visit. I tried their mocha latte and paid with the CUPS app, which help strike a conversation with the gal at the counter that greeted me.

Overall, the service is great and friendly. This shop is like a mom and pops shop with some of the best quality cup cake I've taste. I ordered one of their newer flavor, pumpkin with cream cheese which was lip smacking delicious. 

The price range can be a little high for the size, but for the taste I wouldn't complain. The bakery bake their cupcakes fresh daily, and each cupcake is like a work of art on their own."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2014-03-03,2.0,"Beautiful, tiny, tasty $3 cupcakes.

The cupcakes are very pretty, with flowers and colorful icing.  That said they are tiny, there is nothing wrong with that.  One was by far enough, as it was very sweet.  I tried a maple walnut one.  The maple icing made it taste like french toast.  Good, but sweet.  The cake itself was nice and moist, the walnuts gave it a great taste.  I just couldn't believe it was $3 each.

Cupcake Cafe is often invisible from the street. Inside, you will feel like you are stepping into the best parts of New York from the late 80s-90s. This is a pre-computer coffee shop (though they do have wifi). 
There is no pretense here, just a strong community of locals, a giant slab of marble with stacks of old New York Times and house plants, and the very best cappuccino I have ever had in my life. 
Plus a sprawling bakery in the back turning out cupcakes and cakes to order at reasonable prices. 
This place is by far the best thing in mid town, and one of my absolute favorite spots in the city."

I had flowers deco on my cake, i would suggest that if you do get a cake from here with flower decos, carry it like a freaking baby!! If not it will look different from the time you received it from them to the time you open the box at home. Since its buttercream frosting it can be smushed lol.

Atmosphere is weird and eclectic.

Cupcakes were meh.  Lots of butter.  Ordered a maple/walnut cupcake and a chocolate/vanilla cupcake.

1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2016-03-13,4.0,Stars for the environment! Wandered over here after a long bus ride from woodstock. Stepping in here is such a nice wind down in comparison to outside. Not the tastiest cupcakes i ve had but definitely one of the best decorated ones. They also offer tea and all kinds of coffee. Nice and calm with the jazz radio running. Its like tea time in a vintage furniture store.
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2014-08-04,4.0,"It gets 4 stars for O.G. NY""tude"" alone!

When you walk in, it looks like a hot mess. Sure the old benches (or pews) are cool mixed in with the other random chairs and tables to create seating arrangements that one normally sees at a flea markets, but they are freaking uncomfortable! The wooden ice box is dope though. This is on the left toward the back and around the corner from the front counter,  where Mr. SALTY makes your coffee. 

The OG barista is a huge reason why I come here. He looks like he could easily play Santa during the holidays and comes across as a dick. But, he is a NY character that is a perfect match with the vibe of the joint. He'll never be ""Disney"" nice (thank God), but he's actually nice by city standards. The music he plays, which is a combo of ""nothing before 1959"" on an old radio, is spot on; it's him. 

I never want to know his name or his story. The scenarios I have made up as to how he got here and why he works here are a novel in my head! Sometimes, when I watch him interact with shocked tourists or newbeez it can get a little awkward, due to his blank stare and the ""what the fuck do you want"" demeanor, but it's highly entertaining. The tude is mostly fluff; he's just an old man. And he's survived a long time in this city, which that alone gives him a pass. 

He, this place and the locals who come here are mesmerizing to me. If this were the L.E.S. or Bushwick, hipsters would eat this place up. Thank God it's hidden in the shit show of the Port Authority. 

The coffee by no means is great. It's good. The Americano, is weak by my standards. I've had better drip coffee at serious coffee joints then the Americano here. That said, I'm not a coffee snob, so the coffee is just ""good enough"" to keep me coming back. Why? Because, I'm here for the WiFi and bad Santa, foo! 

There's a cupcake counter in the back. Now, here's the deal on that: they make them here, but they start off at $3 for a small. I got the peanut butter. The icing, which there is a lot of, is the cat's meow, but the cake is average to poor. My cake was dryer then my sense of humor, which is pretty fucking dry. And, that's what that's all about... not worth $3 for me. 

So why do I like this place? It's a character. Bad Santa barista guy is a character. The interior aesthetic is a character. There's WiFi. It's never really super crowded. Even when it is, it's not the Starfucks kind of crowd, so that's a bonus for me!  Maybe, bad santa keeps them away? What else do you need from an indy coffee shop across from Port Authority. If you are a snob that is also a pampered pooch, stay at Starbucks. If you appreciate, ""wtf is this"" kinda of moments, eclectic Hells kitchen locals plus free WiFi in midtown, then this is the jimmy jam playa!"
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2012-08-08,5.0,"I grew up with Cupcake Cafe cakes for my birthday, and now they're my cake standard. I'm not a frosting person at all but I LOVE their frosting. The buttercream is sweet and creamy. My favorite is the walnut with maple buttercream.

I picked up a couple cupcakes for my birthday this year & the guy filling the box was sweet enough to throw in an extra cup to prevent the cupcakes from moving and ruining the gorgeous buttercream flowers. I took the bus from Port Authority to Paramus and all the cupcakes stayed in tact.

The employees are super nice and you can't go wrong with their maple walnut cake.  YUM."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2012-10-16,2.0,"Very disappointed. I wish I would've seen my friend's (Nina R.) review of this place before heading into this store :(

I Yelp'd and found the Cupcake Cafe and with 3 stars I decided to try it out. The restaurant itself is a little dingy and looked pretty run down. I headed to the back counter area to peruse their cupcake selection. I stood there for a short bit then was greeted by very nice worker. Then to my utter surprise, he asked me if it was ok that he goes and washes his hands first. Umm...let me think about that...YES, PLEASE!! Seriously, need you ask? Yikes. Well, on the upside, I guess he did ask :) 

The frosting, while pretty, was oily and basically tasted like pure butter, not butter cream. I'm not clear on why others seem to rave about their buttercream...perhaps I got a bad (very bad) batch? I am glad it wasn't mounded in abundance since it wasn't very good and made it easier to scrape off. The cake, not a winner either, was dry, crumbly and had such a mild flavor to them. If I had eaten them blind I'm not sure I could clearly distinguish the vanilla and chocolate flavors. 

Unfortunately, the frosting was a such a huge turn off, the cake was dry and lacked flavor so I ended up eating about 2 bites of each and tossed them out. Such a waste considering they were overpriced at $3 for a small cupcake."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2014-07-26,1.0,"Have gone here for years and loved the cakes. Today I picked up 3 cakes for my daughters birthday. While they were putting one in the box I questioned if the box was big/tall enough. The employee said it was completely fine...after arriving home I open the box to smushed flowers and one completely off. I called to see what could be done and pretty much the guy didn't think it was a big deal. I heard things like, ""get over it"", ""you bought 3 cakes what's the big deal?"" When I told him it was a cake display for my daughters first birthday he told me ""who cares it's edible and it's not like she will remember any way"" I was offered a lame 20 dollar credit towards my next purchase haha yeah right. I will never be coming back I am disgusted. Thank god for Lulus cake boutique in Westchester who was able to make 3 better cakes. I threw out the cakes from cupcake cafe. I'm so done."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2012-04-10,3.0,"I don't know if I should slam this place or hold it up to the gods!??!! Their buttercup is the best frosting I have every tasted in my life, the actually cupcake is a little dry but they buttercream makes up for it. And the beautiful little flowers makes you want to take pictures over and over again. 

The little cafe has a homey cafe feel with free wifi, I guess it would be a good place to study or get a cup of coffee and chat with a friend but they owner is so not welcoming. And his hands were dirty looking, maybe chocolate frosting??? he handled the cupcake without gloves and then handled my cash, where's the hand washing?? That can't be clean!

One cupcake was $3... a little high for a small cupcake but I'll do it just for the buttercream!

1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2014-05-28,5.0,"The cupcake with peanut butter frosting tested my powers of self-control, which are admittedly rather limited with respect to food.  And you can get really cold milk to wash it down with, which I think is critical.    I have never had a better cupcake.

The room where you sit is awkwardly shaped and decorated with bric-a-brac.  There's a slovenly, scraggly-bearded man with an insouciant look near the front counter.  If he has ever uttered the words ""May I help you?"" it was a long time ago.  As we passed him in silence, he said ""Is it something I DIDN'T say?""   

Apparently, these people are serious about making quality cupcakes.  They dispense with everything else, including customer service and decor.  And they're not afraid of scaring off customers with sardonic remarks.

Now, why would a place like this stay in business in New York City unless the product was REALLY good?  Answer: It wouldn't.  That's why you should come here."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2009-10-17,2.0,"This cafe looks funky and is a nice refuge from the business of the Port Authority area. It has its quirks: figurines, random framed photo graphs, mismatched tables and chairs. It looked like the type of place I'd been looking for.

However, this place didn't do it for me. First, my latte was bitter and flavorless - probably one of the worst lattes I've ever had. Then, around the room is this ledge where framed paintings lean, but it's just at the level where if I leaned back, my head would be gouged by this unnecessary ledge. The chairs are uncomfortable, and there are three separate counters, which I thought was strange. (Who uses the back counter?)

I can't vouch for the cupcakes or anything else being sold in glass jars, but I would not necessarily recommend this place. I hate to say it, but I probably would have preferred a bland, loud Starbucks to this."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2010-10-10,3.0,"3 1/2 stars

Upon entering the place, it was, at first, confusing.  There is a counter where one can order coffee and there are no cupcakes in sight.  In fact, after I entered, I went back outside to double-check the sign to see if I was in the right place.

Anyway...the cupcakes are located around the corner and to the right of the coffee counter.   When I found the right counter, there was no one there.  I waited a minute or two and a clerk appeared.  The cupcake selection was limited but that was OK.  I wanted one that was all vanilla and one that was all chocolate and they had both.  So...I gave the clerk my order and he asked ""small or large?""  Oh, heck!  Why does it have to be so tempting to supersize LOL?  Yet, supersize, I did.  After all, I rationalized, we were on vacation so why not splurge.

The cupcakes are beautifully decorated---almost too pretty to eat!  When we did eat them later that day, we found that the cake is on the dense side.  Yet it was moist.  The problem with dense cakes is that if they sit too long, they tend to dry out.  Thus I could tell that the cupcakes were indeed fresh.  I ate the all vanilla one and found that it had good flavor and wasn't overly sweet.  My husband liked the all chocolate one and found that it wasn't too rich.

Note:  If you've ever been in the DC Metro area and tried a cupcake from Cakelove, the cake consistency is similar to that.  Cakelove is generally good but they do have their off days and you end up with a dried out cupcake.  With that in mind, I wonder if Cupcake Cafe is like that..."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2016-02-15,1.0,Took a look at the cupcakes and thought they looked yummy. We were instructed to go to the front and ask for help. Went to the front and asked the gentleman for help informing him we were instructed to come and ask for assistance. We were told it was unfortunate. He went through the cupcake options and  wiped his nose with his hands and then proceeded to take out the cupcakes and box them (no gloves). We paid for the cupcakes and disposed of them. I won't be back for lack of hygiene and customer service.

1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2013-06-13,4.0,"I had the most interesting conversation with the man at the counter...

I was in the area for another reason and needed to check my emails and whatnot. So, I stopped in here to see if they have WIFI. 

I enter into the cafe and from the feel of it, you know it has been around for some time. Odd ended tables, chairs and couches, but all so comfy and homey. This place has character for sure, and the guy at the counter contributes to the ambiance. 

Here is our strange conversation. I ask him if he could make me a cup of coffee. He stares at me blankly. He's like yea we can make you coffee. Then I asked if he could make it with soy milk. He said yea ok. Then I asked if there was WIFI. And then he says to me yea sure we can make you a cup of WIFI. He was spaced out and of course, I am kind of spacey too. So, we just stand there staring at each other. He then reaches his hand into a small cup on the counter and then slips me a small slip of paper. On it, is the WIFI password. He did make me a good cup of coffee and it was pretty cheap, only $2.50. He definitely was weird, but I like that. I definitely will remember him. 

They have two counters, which is weird. The front counter is where the guy sits and the back counter is to order cupcakes. I did take a look at the cupcakes, but the icing colors were just too weird for me to consume one. I didn't know if I would glow in the dark after that...

Anyhow, this place has character, makes a decent cup of joe and has free WIFI!"
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2013-08-08,2.0,"""Meh, I've experienced better"" sounds about right. 

The cake texture wasn't what I hoped for... it was almost dry. 

There are unique flavors offered - but not all the fillings are in-house prepared fixings. 

I was intrigued to try them due to the beautiful cakes they are known for, but based on my my cupcake experience, I did not temp to purchase the cake."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2014-04-09,5.0,Best cupcakes.  Delicate detailing worth the $3... I eat them feeling guilty not because of my gut but because of it's like eating ART... I am so happy I found this place.  Also it's been around since 1988 so it beat the 'fad' and the bakers have been 'doing their thang' for a while.  Also really nice people work there.  Just a nice quaint spot with good cupcakes each of the ladies in my office couldn't stop raving about.
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2013-08-19,1.0,"Sorry to be so extreme here. But these were the worst cupcakes I have ever had from a store with 'Cupcakes' in the title! 

I knew I was not going to like this place as soon as I walked in and it smelled horrible. musky and gross.. The place did not look clean as well. The people behind the counter seemed to careless if I was going to give them business as well.. 

Upon looking at the pretty cupcakes, you would hope it could only taste as good as it looked! You would be so very wrong! These cupcakes were so obscenely dry they almost chocked me. Icing tasted like nothing as well.... These cupcakes reminded me of those pathetic dry cupcakes you would get from a very old and bad italian bakery... not pleasant...

i hate getting excited about cupcakes just to be let down.. :("
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2013-08-30,4.0,"You know, this is place isn't bad. I'd give it 3.5 if I could, but the guy behind the counter is nice so I'll round up.

It's a little small, a little creaky which I like, and is a quintessential anti-corporate cafe. The location is pretty bad, so I don't go out of my way to go there, but that also means it's somewhat perfect because where else can you stop in for a chilled out cup of coffee in a rustic setting on a walk from uptown to midtown along 8th, 9th or 10th aves? With such a close proximity to the Port Authority, this place manages to keep out both the weirdos and the suits, but it doesn't feel oppressively hip or anything.

Anyway, I always grab something simple like a cup of iced coffee (their coffee is darn good) and have tried their pastries which I recall being excellent. I've had some meetings there, and they have a great assortment of table types - small to large, booths to standalone tables. I'd put it on the list of nice oases in the city that operate counter to Starbucks and Au Bon Pain."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2013-07-14,3.0,"My friend and I found this place while walking and decided to go in, seeing as the name suggests they're all about cupcakes. I guess they are, but the cupcakes themselves are in the very back. We were greeted by a nice young guy behind the cupcake counter (hi Nathan!), but the older man who worked there was quite odd and grumpy. He actually took the cupcake that I had brought in from another store (look, no judging, I'm a cupcake-a-holic!) and was examining the packaging. Apparently Burgers and Cupcakes down the street packs cupcakes to-go the same way this guy supposedly innovated (upside down coffee cup with a lid, the cupcake resting on the lid). 

After that weirdness, the older man walked away and we struck up a conversation with the very nice, quite intelligent guy serving the cupcakes. He was pretty cool and we chatted about cupcakes and good NYC eats for a few minutes. We decided on the vanilla/vanilla cupcake and also got a chocolate/chocolate to-go. 

We let them sit out a while--the advice of the young man--and that was some good advice. Nothing ruins a cupcake like a chilly density. I'll be honest, the cupcake was okay--just okay. I liked the vanilla a bit better, and my friend liked the chocolate better. The cake was just kind of average and the frosting was silky, but lacked a deep flavor. I do have to trust a place that's been in business here in the city for 25 years, though. That says something. Perhaps I should try a different flavor next time and see if my opinion changes.

Overall, it was a nice experience going in, and next time I'll try the coffee out."
1020,cupcake-cafe-new-york,2014-03-04,5.0,"Five stars simply because the place is as quaint and homey as it can get for a coffee shop PLUS it has cupcakes. And also because it's down the block from me. 

I went here around 8 am one morning a few months ago with a woman I'd just met. We had the best and most in depth conversation that lasted 'til 1:30 pm when we decided to leave due to hunger pangs creeping into our stomachs. 

We ordered two cups of coffee at the front counter from an older gentleman who is quite... Different... I guess you could say. (I'd like to sit and talk with him to see what comes out!) He was so nice. We then ordered a cupcake each from the back counter and found ourselves seated in a cozy corner, also in the back. 

As far as coffee goes, nothing to complain about. The cupcake was not outstanding but still good enough to eat. Not a huge fan of icing in general so that didn't do anything for me. 

I haven't gone back lately but perhaps one day!

Oh btw, just a public service announcement: it is not okay to hit on people as they're drinking coffee and stuffing their fat face with a cupcake. Let us be chunky in peace."

However, they aren't transparent about where they get their food and the menu descriptions do not match the dish. For example, I ordered stuffed berry French toast that was apparently stuffed with cream cheese and made out of challah bread. What came out looked like two pieces of reheated, frozen Aunt Jemima French toast with berries. They basically took a $5 meal and charged me $20 for it. 

Their baked goods and pastries always look amazing but they were shady about telling me where they are from so it makes me think they must all be frozen wholesale food.

I have almost always only ordered the complete hot dinner often with extra sides and dessert.  The dinner comes promptly, is well-prepared, tasty, nearly always what was ordered. The portions are generous, and the menu is expansive, with several dinner specials, which usually means items off the menu.  Despite the different chefs who must come and go, I do not think I ever detected any inconsistency in how the dishes are prepared.  

The meals are balanced and nutritious.  Most of the dishes are prepared from scratch with high quality ingredients which are fresh and often in season and without shortcuts.  This is a lot of responsibility to maintain and rarely if ever has a menu item run out.  

The men who answer the phone to take my order are courteous and often even friendly and warm as time has gone on, including the delivery men, whom I give a very big tip because the are consistently prompt, cheerful and hard-working.

1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2020-02-12,4.0,"Food was really good, staff was prompt and the service was fast.
The chicken strips are big and tasty as was the chicken club but their fries were great"
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-12-20,1.0,Came in on a rainy Tuesday at 4. Restaurant is completely empty and the manager refused to sit me in the window and made a whole scene about it. So I had a delicious and cheaper sandwich across the street!
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2020-01-15,4.0,The diner itself is quite average. The food we ordered came quickly and was  pretty good if not exceptional but I had to write this review because of the nothing short of exceptional piece of seven layer cake. It was simply delicious.  I don't usually eat cakes but this one I had to finish. Try a piece when you are there or take it with you to enjoy later!
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-11-27,1.0,"Worst service!! One waiter,  man behind counter watching and eating.  Server picks up dirty dishes and serves food as well.  Disgusting just disgusting!
Took server 35 min to even acknowledge us!"
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-11-07,1.0,"Thursday night at 10:30 pm. I could not get the hostess to acknowledge or seat me. Several staff walked by me. After standing there for 7 minutes I walked out and dined somewhere else. 

On my way back the manager or owner who is usually always there was visible in the front. I guess the staff really slacks off when he is not there. Server with blond hair horrible . Pot roast old and gross."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-10-26,1.0,"Came here late at night with friends. A busser gave us water and greeted us promptly, sadly he seemed like the only person doing their job that night. We sat there for 20 minutes without a menu, the waitress just looked at us and wouldn't stop by the table or even say a word. Another table was also trying to get her attention for the better part of our stay so we figured we weren't going to be helped anytime soon. We would've asked the hostess but when a man walked in and was served right away we decided to leave for another nearby diner and had a great time. I've worked every position in a restaurant and would never ignore guests the way they did."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-12-12,1.0,"I ate here 5 years ago and was served the most vile veggie burger i've ever had. Returned today for breakfast and had a similarly disappointing experience. 

The veggies in my omlette were hard (under cooked)
The hashbrowns were hard (under cooked)
The butter for my toast was hard (from the fridge)

I know I could've sent everything back and tried again but given that it took 15 mins to fill the order I really didn't have enough time before work to try again. 

I would like to give the service a positive review because the staff were polite and attentive - but the entire counter staff were openly talking about me, in front of me. I guess they didn't realize la blancita speaks spanish."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2020-01-18,1.0,"I was just starting my morning and I remember coming here back when I worked in the area, to my surprise - huge difference! Not in a good way. When I walked in, the hostess (I guess) asked how many? I responded with 1. She slammed her hand against her thigh after pointing to the counter saying ""just sit there"". Umm ok, is that how you were trained?? Anywho, then the counter ""server"" asked for here or to go? I said ""for here"" he (out of no where) pull up a warm glass of water and gave it to me, as if the water was poured a little while ago. Placed the menu and walked away, I had to grab his attention bbg waving my hand and ask for a coffee. I order a side of hash, pancakes, and scrambled eggs. Later on added a small (emphasis on small) orange juice. Want to guess the total of my check?? $32.95!!! I asked why so much? His response was the side of hash and scrambled eggs was 13.95. I said wow!! On my way out I stepped up to the counter to pay the bill, and another server, yelling excuse excuse my friend (as she walks by me, literally moving me out the way with her arm) saying I need too  pass. I was very unhappy with my visit here. Food was decent, obviously beyond over priced and the service was horrible. Wouldn't recommend it and do not plan on her ever re-visiting."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2018-08-06,3.0,"I only came here because I read that Lorde wrote a lot of Melodrama here. I should've brought a notebook, sat down, and tried to get some inspiration but instead I just ate an omelette. California. Good size chunks of avocado. It was served with fries for some reason... instead of potatoes. That was odd and honestly I wasn't a fan. 

Service was fast, attentive. Food was slightly above average. Lorde ate here. And it's a diner so really, what can you ask for?"
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2018-06-17,3.0,"Not great, not clean, and horrible service. The food was pretty decent and the menu had something for everyone so squeezing it to barely 3 stars and something I wouldn't suggest sober. 

Was sat at a table with dirty silver (visible cheese hanging off)"
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-12-04,1.0,"I go here many times for desserts. Always decent portions for the price and I've never complained. But I went here on the night of December 4th and ordered a slice of plain cheesecake. I was EXTREMELY upset by the actions before my eyes. With 1 slice left in one of their refrigerators behind the counter, the owner or manager went and cut half of that to give to me and charge me full price. I saw him do this right in front of me while looking extremely confused. How is giving someone half of a half for the full price of $6.45 right? Is that what this diner is doing now? Cheating their customers out of the food they pay for. This is a low, disgusting, and upsetting action. The slice of cake was so sad and when I mentioned it to the cashier all she said back was the total while waiting for my card. I now know to bring my business elsewhere and pass on my knowledge of the disrespect."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-09-16,3.0,"Sometimes, you just need grilled cheese and french fries.  Or bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll.  Or mozzarella sticks.  

These are all things that the Flame does exceedingly well.  A simple, neighborhood diner, this is the place you come for a casual breakfast or a late night meal after a night on the town.  (Or, a place where you order delivery of a late night meal or heavy breakfast after a night out on the town.)  Once you start to stray from diner basics, you begin to take risks.  Ordering the Greek pizza, for instance, would be ill-advised.  But stay in their wheelhouse, and you'll be more than happy.

Some on here have expressed disdain for the service.  If you want to be coddled and spoonfed, then don't go to a classic New York City diner.  Take your avocado toast to go.  The Flame's service is exactly what it should be:  no more, no less."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2017-03-16,3.0,"This diner served up a great diner quality breakfast on a Sunday morning.  The service was fast and efficient. There were 6 of us and we were seated immediately.   Our food came out quickly.  The OJ was fresh squeezed, the coffee was diner quality and the tea a Lipton Tea Bag (even though the menu indicates House Special Tea).

We ordered an array of breakfast items from scrambled eggs, omelettes  to french toast.They all came with potatoes and a choice of toast. Each dish delivered a solid breakfast. Outside of breakfast, the menu was quite extensive with various offerings for lunch and dinner."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-05-22,5.0,"My breakfast burrito was AMAZING.  I came here after a Betty Who concert and the wait staff was incredible.  Thank you, Flame Diner!!  Also, free delivery + cocktails!"
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-05-02,5.0,"Incredible diner. In an era, where diners are fast disappearing, this one, under the current management, stands far above the rest. Clean, comfortable, with excellent counter service for breakfast or lunch. Refills on coffee are plentiful and fast. If you're looking for great diner fare, look no further than The Flame."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-05-21,3.0,"The ambiance is that if old school diner, however the food was mediocre at best and the service was rushed. The owners seemed very nice and accommodating however our waitress was a bit stand-offish. Nice enough but not a place I would revisit."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2018-01-03,3.0,"Traditional diner experience, plain and simple - no frills. Ate here on New Year's Day, it was busy but once you were seated and had a waiter appear you were set. My order got mixed up, but again they were slammed with customers. I was too hungry at that point to wait for what I actually ordered.

Good:
-Flame Omelette 
-Corned Beef Hash Benedict

Bad:
-I found out after I waited for it that the Corned Beef Hash Benedict was actually just scrambled eggs and hash (not poached egg over hash over a bun with Hollandaise sauce)"
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-01-08,4.0,"We order from this diner an average of 6-10 times a week for delivery. 
Quick delivery. 
Daily specials.
Recently raised prices ( some increases make sense others do not. Burgers for instance went up additional $3.)
Food always good quality. Basic diner fare."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2018-12-22,1.0,"This was the worst diner experience I've had, at least regarding food. Service was fine.

I ordered corned beef hash and eggs, but the corned beef hash had a really nasty taste to it, the eggs tasted of nothing, and the potato hash also tasted of nothing.

They were quick to replace the dish with bacon and eggs, but unfortunately the bacon tasted nasty too. I ended up just saying the flavorless eggs, paying and leaving. 

Try Fluffies across the road instead."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-10-20,1.0,"The omelette and the potatoes were dry.  Service was good until you have questions about the check with unclear itemized line items that was written when you requested your check, then the waitress became annoyed and gave attitude."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-07-15,1.0,"One of the worst services.  They were rude but mostly neglectful. One couple walked out because they didn't get served. No one came to us to take our order either, we had to ask.  The milkshake was Watery like they only  put a table spoon of ice cream. Terrible.  And the place smelled unclean."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-11-21,2.0,"It's only a diner, fine, but the schlocky careless presentation of over-priced awful food (salmon burger deluxe, flavorless topped with white tomato slices) is almost depressing. Only in a pinch. I've been here just a few times and always leave asking ""why did I just go there?"""
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2018-01-08,3.0,"Traditional diner, nothing too out of the ordinary. Came on a  Saturday and it was surprisingly not busy which is always nice. 
I ordered the lumberjack, which only came with three pieces of bacon, two pieces of French toast and what looked to be barely one scrambled egg. Nonetheless, it was still good. 
I feel like this place is a great place to come when you're hungover or need something quick and easy. I wouldn't call it a ""cute"" NYC diner, but it is a typical one."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-10-07,4.0,Nothing special here other than an expensive diner.  Omelet was fine and the service was also pretty good.  I guess it's pricy because it's on 58th...
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-08-03,1.0,"Disgusting place. Poor food, bad service. They only good thing is they serve free water."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-11-03,3.0,"Great breakfast foods, but overpriced and service is unpredictable. Went here for several years but after a while just seemed not worth it anymore. Figured I could get a lot better food elsewhere for the same price. Not comparable to NJ diners in terms of both quality and price."
1021,the-flame-diner-new-york-2,2019-10-06,1.0,"Only walk in to this place if you want to be taken advantage of. They're awful, never get sauce with your food, or, we'll, the right food. Late night spot where they take advantage of the fact that you've had 5 drinks. Disgusting."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2020-03-10,5.0,Great coffee and other drinks. Good service and nice atmosphere. I ordered the iced Matcha and I think it is one of the best in NYC
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2019-12-29,3.0,3.5 but there is strong potential for a 4 and i think if i came back it could round up. The coffee was mediocre but the shop itself was charming especially in an area that lacks mom and pop shops. Quant inside with friendly service. The ice coffee was a little watery and there was no stevia (I know this is a personal thing but I feel like most coffee shops have it now). Definitely would come back here.
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2020-03-04,5.0,"In a city full of coffee choices, Kahve stands out as one of my favorites! I pride myself as a coffee snob (for better or worse) and when I find a place that pays attention to the fine details , it means a lot to me. The espresso is roasted to perfection without a bitter taste and their selection of drinks represents their detailed knowledge of drinks. Not only can you get a cortado, but you can get a cuban cortadito. For those that aren't familiar, this is a cortado made with sugar and steamed evaporated milk. Try it...you won't regret it!"
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2019-12-27,4.0,"Discovered this place on Yelp a few weeks back. My sister lives right around the corner so I'm surprised it took me so long to try it. It is a small shop in the heart of HK. They have a few seats all which were occupied with people doing work on their laptops when I went. The menu has some interesting espresso drinks with flavors I don't see often at coffee shops so I'll have to come back to try them. I went with a large dark roast coffee to go, which was absolutely delicious. It was full of flavor and served at the perfect temperature. I was so happy to see they also had Oat Milk available, hard to find but oh, so good (bonus points for them!) The prices are a bit steep for a cup of coffee -- even in NYC and the staff was incredibly slow. It took way to long to get a cup of coffee when there was no line which is not ideal if you're looking to snag a cup on your morning commute. Overall, a refreshing find from a sea of coffee chains in the city. I'll be sure to come back to try out a espresso beverage."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2019-10-29,5.0,"The chai tea latte here is very good, I tried it many places but I will stick with this place .
Nice atmosphere, excellent service ."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2018-10-07,3.0,"If you're in need of a quick breakfast, Kahve is a good option. It's a coffee shop/breakfast spot with wifi, seating, and a printer (yeah, weird, but it's their thing. You can print anything you need while you're there). 

I ordered the BLT with avocado and an over easy egg and it was tasty. It came on two slices of white bread filling me up and the price was reasonable.

I recommend Kahve if you want a quick place to eat in the morning!"
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2019-09-06,3.0,"Was disappointed in the strength and taste of my latte. Wanted to avoid Starbucks, but ended up being a disappointing drink."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2018-06-04,3.0,"Dropped by Kahve for a miel latte to sooth my soul, and that it did. The service was lame; the guy seemed annoyed to be helping me, but no matter. I ordered the miel latte with almond milk, and it was delicious, especially with some added cinnamon, but I don't think a latte with some added honey should be over $6. It's a bit outrageous, if you ask me. 

Kahve itself is an adorable little cafe, with coziness level to the max. Everyone is sitting around working on their laptops, so if you're looking for a quiet place to work in or read, this is perfect. It may be too quiet for a date or meeting of some sort, as everyone around would be able to hear you, and for me, that'd get awkward. The music is low, but the prices are high, so I wouldn't make it a regular trip, but a fun splurge every now and then when I'm in the mood for a unique latte the hipsters would like.

If you do want to come regularly, get their card. After ten drinks, you get a small one for freezies."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2019-08-31,5.0,"What a gem in Hell's Kitchen! We were picking up bikes at Al's next door and were surprised by the relaxed, happening vibe. The the cold brew was on draft, they had complimentary oat milk!, and the service was on point. They also have small bites and it looked like a bunch of them could be made vegetarian. Will definitely make it back next time I need a pick me up in Midtown West!"
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2020-01-22,5.0,Kahve is the best local coffee shop int he area. In an era of chain store coffee this place stands out form the pack. The location is also very favorable for those of us whole live further to the west in HK. They are always friendly and I have never had a bad drink. I would highly recommend stopping by if you are looking for caffeine fix.
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2019-05-15,5.0,"A gem in Hell's Kitchen 
Best coffee
Matcha with oat milk made to perfection by Eroll. (Spelling?) 
Best way to start the day with a cup of delicious tea or coffee prepared here at their beautiful location. 

I wanted to keep it all to myself, but's it's so much nicer to share :-) 

Stop by and enjoy"
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2019-11-09,5.0,"Good coffee, try the apple turnover, it's pretty darn good! Don't live close by but if I did this would be my everyday coffee stop."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2019-09-14,1.0,"Popped into Kahve to get a regular latte and cappuccino. We ordered them with whole milk. Both were far too hot and my partner burned her tongue even after waiting ten minutes to try it. The taste was bland, neither of us could actually taste any coffee.
We also ordered some pain au chocolat, which were still warm to their credit. But they were way over baked and crunchy throughout. 
For the price we paid it was overpriced and underwhelming."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2017-10-28,4.0,Great cozy place. Nice environment and great service. Had a nice variety of selections with foods that cannbe cooked to order. Got the zebra mocha and it was a bit on the pricier side of coffee but it was good. I recommend this place and would come back . :)
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2017-12-22,2.0,"I came here to have a nice brunch with my friends because the reviews praised the food. Well I can't speak for the rest of the food but I had the traditional avocado toast with arugula and the iced vanilla mint latte. The avocado toast was terrible. I think it was the lemon juice (maybe vinegar) but it was sooo sour. And it smelled strange. I tried a couple bites but I couldn't stomach it. The latte was alright but not worth the hype. It was a little too bitter and I couldn't taste the mint or vanilla- just tasted like a plain latte. For a total of $16 it was definitely not worth it. And there's not much seating either.
The only reason that I gave 2 stars is because of the presentation. If only it tasted as good as it looked."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2019-04-26,5.0,"Cute spot to grab a drink the staffs are very friendly and professional. Excellent banana muffin, unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to try any of their other food. Their iced matcha with soy is also quite delicious."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2018-07-26,1.0,"Honestly used to love this place. Great coffee. Great atmosphere. The barista that works the register has been so rude my girlfriend and I on numerous occasions that we will no longer be going back unless it's taken care of. 

You are a barista, not a celebrity, not the most important person in the room.  Get over yourself and treat your customers with some kindness - or at least decency."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2018-03-08,5.0,"Great coffee place! It's small inside but it wasn't too crowded when we were there around 1pm and we found a spot to sit. The caramel latte is good and so is the peppermint mocha. Tried the gingerbread mocha too - I wouldn't recommend that one though. 
Overall, nice coffee shop. Definitely would come back."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2019-02-25,2.0,"I stopped in for a mid-afternoon coffee and to do some computer work.  I was unfamiliar with the coffee options in the area, so I went to Yelp. Kahve was close, with good reviews/ratings. The interior is pleasant. The drip coffee was mediocre, at best. Counter service was distracted. The internet did not work for me."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2016-02-24,5.0,"It's been months in the works - but, finally, Kahve's second location on 47th and 10th is finally open!  If you've been to Kahve on 52nd and 9th, you'll recognize the same amazing coffee and pastries, and you're also in for a few surprises!

Even on their opening day, they are fully supplied for all of your favorite coffees and espresso drinks. Just like their 9th avenue location, fast wifi, electrical outlets, recycled materials and reclaimed wood in various components around the coffeeshop where possible, and friendly smiling faces.  The new location is much larger, with plenty of seating, electrical outlets are everywhere, including fast charging USB stations at almost every chair.  And still to come, later hours (likely til midnight) and various beers on tap and wines to add to their awesome coffee and espresso drinks. 

My favorite drink here is the Cafe Miel - it's a espresso drink with honey topped off with a sprig of mint!  So good!  The croissants are so flaky and they practically melt in your mouth!  Definitely will continue to come back again and again!  If this is opening day, I'm truly looking forward to see how Kahve On 10th continues to evolve!  Congrats guys on an awesome first day!"
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2016-03-09,3.0,"This new coffee joint takes the place of the old Bis Co Latte shop. Been to their 9th avenue location before (also 3 stars) so was hoping for something better here.

Early morning on a Wednesday - got the Cuban coffee ($4) and the Artichoke/Goat Cheese Croissant ($5.50). Coffee was good, particularly sweet as a cafe cubano should be, but not too hot that it burnt my tongue. Disappointed in the croissant though - felt the flavors didn't blend well and maybe could have used more filling. 

I do like the fact that this shop opens early. The competition in the area for coffee shops is intense, so hoping the best for Kahve."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2019-04-05,5.0,"Loved the cozy place, avacado toast tasted so good and these guys have the sweetest smiles while handling you the coffee or meal. Great job! Thank you :)"

1022,kahve-new-york-4,2017-05-07,3.0,"Decent wine, mediocre service. The bartender/barista rushed us out as it was nearing closing time so we had to down our wine. Not the best experience."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2017-10-04,4.0,"This is my new favorite coffee place for a number of reasons: the music is good, but not too loud, their peanut butter cookies are delicious and their internet fast. The cookie price was too high, but then I tasted and completely forgave them. Man, it is good!"
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2016-10-24,5.0,"I really enjoyed the one drink I got there. It was an iced coconut toffee lattee I believe...
This spot closes at 1030 so you can stay and work on whatever u gotta do and it was pretty quiet as well. They seem to have a bunch of unique stuff. They also serve wine cocktails here as well.

I think this will be my goto coffee joint in nyc from now on."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2016-07-09,4.0,"The coffee is probably not the best. But the place is so lovely and this location also offers drinks/cocktails. It has those fancy coffee, with white chocolate/raspberry. The Cuba drink comes with three espresso shots! A lot of caffeine. I just get usual latte and the barista does the latte art even mine is to go. Plus, it's just Starbucks price."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2016-04-13,5.0,"Totally got the hype here! As a girl enjoys all kinds of exotic type food (and drinks), I would strongly recommend this place given its extensive list of signature coffee drinks.

I got the lavender vanilla latte (and substituted for skim milk, as you all know me...), it carries a slight flora scent, on top of the vanilla smell and I thought those made a perfect combination. Aside of that, I saw many Yelp pictures on zebra mocha and it looks delicious to me - would love to come back for a casual sip.

My server was very attentive and smiled to me all the time. I guess I completely fell in love with this place!"
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2018-04-06,4.0,It's a nice place if you want to try out a same same but different coffee place. I don't recommend their own coffee caramel blend though :)) stick to their classic house coffee.
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2017-07-18,4.0,"I came by Kahve one Sunday afternoon with my girlfriend for a quick coffee. It had an adorable decor and a great atmosphere, with people sitting around chatting and drinking wine. I could definitely see myself hanging out here one afternoon.

When we saw the menu, we knew we couldn't settle for a coffee. They had tons of fun coffee drinks that were intriguing and different than traditional coffee shops. I got the Zebra mocha and my girlfriend got the Almond Chai. Mine was quite sweet, but very delicious. Because it was a mixture of dark and white chocolate, the flavor was different that a standard mocha and much lighter than a hot chocolate. The Almond Chai was similarly fantastic and had a much mor subtle, but smooth taste.

I'd definitely go back to grab another drink and enjoy the environment!"
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2016-04-09,5.0,"Glad to have Kahve in the neighborhood. An addition to great coffee shops nearby. My favorite is there Almond Chai and Cuban Coffee so good! Love the ambiance and music too. They have a good amount of space. The staff here is very friendly. If i want to just chill, sit down, listen to good music with a good cup of coffee, this is where i go.

I haven't tried their pastries though. Maybe because Sullivan St. Bakery is nearby. Love the bread and pastries there. Same goes with Jolly Goat coffee - love their Cafe Americano. But then Sullivans and Jolly Goat doesn't have the space that Kahve has."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2017-09-02,3.0,"Sweet little coffee shop close to the corner of W 47th St & 10th Ave. Decent coffee, but expensive upcharge for almond milk. Do we really still need to do that? Come on."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2018-04-25,4.0,What a great find with a good relaxing atmosphere to study and even chat. Clean bathroom. Great variety of coffee and drink selection. I got the colarito the way I get it in Miami with one shot really foaming. Will come back for sure
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2018-11-19,5.0,"Love the coffee, the staff and the avocado breakfast toast!! The guys that work here are so friendly and the coffee is the best I have had in Hell's Kitchen. The fact they serve wine is a bonus!!"

Some staff are very friendly and welcoming. Other scare you away immediately with their bad attitude. 

Nevertheless I came back almost daily to have my morning coffee. 

I must say the quality of the coffee is very low. The expressos taste not balanced at all. Mostly very acid. The milk is heated way to long so my milk ended up tasteless and hard to drink. 

The only things a love about Kahve is the size of their bars. It feels very cozy and their huge range of different teas. 

So kudos to some very big staff , and step your game to some others. 

Btw: the music is very lame and cheesy"
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2018-01-12,4.0,"Pricey but great. Small so may or may not get a seat, but if you can, it is a wonderful spot to work or write. Calm, open, clean. Some stay warm and friendly, some not so much. Still a place I love to go. Coffee tastes wonderful. Interesting tea choices and snacks as well!"
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2018-10-04,1.0,"Honestly I loved this place. great coffee and atmosphere. BUT today, myself and a co-worker came into Khave Coffee as we usually do on random days of the week. We  usually go to the 9th Ave location. The staff there are typically also so friendly and welcoming. I actually deleted my Starbucks app because Kahve had great coffee and amazing people. However today I experience an awful trip to Kahve. I met the rudest barista and an embarrassing moment over my reward card. Basically I ordered two drinks. one for my self and one for my co-worker (it was my turn to treat) I  had an four different cards with all different stamps. I had an snowflake, a flower, stars and little feet. I had one card complete filled which I wanted to redeemed. Yet the barista refused to honor my card because he calmed they only used one kinda stamp and it was not the one I currently had filled. Like I mention before I have cards with for different things on them. I paid for my drinks but was beyond embarrassed with the whole express. The barista basically called me a liar in front of my co-worker and the other customers waiting online. I would go as far as saying if I was not an Latina woman he probably would have not treated my the way that he had. I am very unhappy with Kahve and the service I was provided by Ulas at the 10th ave location."
1022,kahve-new-york-4,2017-02-10,5.0,"Ran in for a quick drink. The device was knowledgeable, fast, and courteous. The shop itself has a cozy updated feel to it. The latte I got was delicious. If I lived in NYC this would be a local spot for me."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2020-01-11,5.0,This location had friendly and funny employees. I've never had a problem with my drinks here. 10/10 would recommend. :)
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2019-09-20,4.0,"While the store is on the smaller side and does get busy, everyone was nice and they had no trouble getting breakfast ready either - some locations seem to trip up when someone orders hot food, funny enough. 

The chicken sausage biscuit sandwich was pretty decent! I could've used some sort of maple or spicy sauce (can get sriracha on the side), bacon needs to be more crispy, and it had minor gristly bites as sausage sometimes does, but not bad. Biscuit was great too, soft and tasty. Might want to sit when chowing down, as the bread does start flaking away, as it should."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2018-07-15,5.0,"This Starbucks location was another one of our many coffee stops in NYC. It was toward the end of the day, and we were tired. Walking throughout NYC on an all day sightseeing binge will really take it out of you!
We stopped by here for some much-needed coffee, as well as a pit stop. Although they were almost closing, they allowed us to order and use the restroom.
The staff here was very friendly. They took our order with a smile, and got us our drinks in a timely manner.
The place was clean, to include their main floor as well as their restroom.
We were in and out in a short amount of time. This place did its job, and did its job well!"
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2019-10-20,4.0,"Standard SBux- sufficient seating, can usually find a spot to work- music can be loud at times, depends on the crew working.  Generally clean, usually quick service, never a long line.  Gets the job done."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2019-09-05,3.0,"I come to this Starbucks often because my doctor is in the area so I choose to wait here. However, coming in here it's always pretty chaotic and they literally blast the music so loud it's hard to concentrate if i try to do my own work while sitting here. I have tried to keep headphones in and it is much louder than anything I try to play over it. Overall it's a fine Starbucks, but just fine."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2019-05-19,3.0,The next time they tell you (as a card member) that there are no free refills (and claim it costs 50cents) I will be sure to whip out the new policy as well as the email reply I just received and insist on a manager! There ARE free refills with the new star policy
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2019-05-13,1.0,"Just left this location after ordering two iced drinks. They handed me one iced and one hot. After I told them I ordered them both iced, the girl proceeded to argue with me that I didn't order iced. This was after she had to already correct my order for getting it wrong and in between talking to her co-worker about how she couldn't read a bus schedule properly which is why she was late to her shift.  I was just disgusted with the level of service."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2018-04-11,2.0,"Stopped by before brunch for a quick pick-me-up after speed walking from Penn Station. Not as spacious as other locations. Service is on the slower side. Ordered a fruit tea, but got a lemonade instead."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2017-11-15,4.0,I stop in here every once in a while since it's close to work. There is usually a line in the morning and sometimes during the afternoon rush. I've never had an issue with the employees here and my order is always made correct. They have almond milk and coconut milk as alternatives for regular milk which I usually end up using. Obviously when it's crowded it will take longer to get your drink order but that should just be known. They have a decent amount of tables and seats for people who are looking to enjoy their drinks. Overall it's a pretty standard Starbucks.
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2019-06-14,4.0,"The service is super nice, I was there in the morning so it was busy, and I got my order immediately but my sisters took forever. Overall a lovely place!"

1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2018-05-09,1.0,"Got coffee this morning for a group of my staff - everyone felt sick afterwards and some even had to leave work. Clearly the coffee was not handled correctly and caused people to feel sick. If you don't feel like having an upset stomach all day, avoid this Starbucks at all costs"
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2016-09-06,5.0,Nice spot to stop in the morning. Their service is fast at this Starbucks. This is definitely the first Starbucks in the city that I have seen move so fast when it was busy. Amazing service here .
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2018-10-15,2.0,"Take noise cancelling headphones (or those over the ear muff things they use at shooting ranges) if you plan to linger (that is, sit) at this place as the in-house ""music"" will blast you out of your seat."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2015-11-09,3.0,"It is a Starbucks. You either love them or don't care. Staff is ok, coffee tastes burnt, and the food is either too salty or super-sweet."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2016-07-08,3.0,"Your average Starbucks.  Not too tiny and not too big.  Nothing very special about this one though it was okay for meeting a date.  It's a little crowded on a weekday afternoon but maybe it's better at different times of day.  Overall, 3 stars sums it up."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2013-12-18,4.0,"This is a great Starbucks! Extremely friendly staff, especially considering how busy they are.

They realize just how many people come to drink coffee and surf the Internet, so there are many seats with tables.

Great Starbucks!"
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2017-03-27,1.0,Under staffed very very slow. Another day again very very slow.  It looks under very staffed.  2 months later. Who manages this they really need to employ more staff.  Two more months still slow because of being understaffed. Long line only 3 staff unable to keep up with orders.
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2015-06-28,3.0,"They offer coconut milk as an option, which for a lactose intolerant person is really exciting.

On the other hand, the woman who took my order forgot that I said iced, and wouldn't put it in my travel mug. What a waste of a paper cup and top."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2014-08-13,4.0,This is one of the biggest Starbuck spaces in this vicinity.  Lots of seating and has a lot of shopping stock.
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2017-03-15,1.0,Worse fucking coffee. The staff is rude except for one slim latino guy who is really friendly. Last 3 times I've been there and ask for caramel macchiato the don't put caramel on it and when I ask for the caramel the say they don't have it but still change the full amount. I definitely no coming to this place again.
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2016-02-14,1.0,"The Chrysler Building is right there. That's it. There's nothing great about this particular Starbucks besides that.The baristas are a hit or miss. Sometimes nice sometimes not. One tried making me feel like an idiot for his mistake - of not hearing that I asked to use a reward for a drink. Sorry, dude, your bad for thinking you can tell me off for not hearing when I said ""I'd like to use a reward."""
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2016-03-24,1.0,OMG!!!! It took over 10 mnts to get regular milk for my coffee. Not even rush hour. The slowest service ever!!!!
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2013-12-12,4.0,"These people have it together.  I wish this Starbucks was by my work (though I do love the one I already frequent by work).  They returned my chipper morning attitude, got me in, got me out, and make my beverage perfectly (no adjustment needed at all).  That was awesome.

THANK YOU!"
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2016-09-19,4.0,"this is a nice size bucky with plenty of tables and space to sit , munch, drink, wifi it and more. on lexington ave between 43rd and 44th st. it's a monday morning and it's already crowded but lines move fast and the folks behind the counter are quick , the full array of bites and drinks and i will go with a plain bagel, blueberry scone and a hot tea . this place caters mostly to the folks who work in the area so you most likely not have to dodge the baby strollers in this starbucks location . the bathrooms are clean , the condiment counters are well stock and i have a table all to myself in the back corner so it looks like a decent monday morning in new york so far."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2014-11-15,1.0,"This is probably among the poorly managed starbucks in the country. I ordered a chai latte and my friend ordered a decaf. It took us over 10 mins to get the drinks, when there was no one else in front of us. Plus they messed my on my order. The space is nice, clean - everything else seemed quite functional for the most part."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2014-08-12,1.0,This is by far the WORST Starbucks I have ever been to.  The odds of getting your drink correct and in a timely fashion are so low it's not even worth it.  They have started my day off poorly more than enough times for me to write this review of a chain (never thought that would happen) and to swear off Starbucks as much as possible.  There's a superb coffee shop- Penny Lane- one block away that has much better coffee and service.
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2011-08-25,4.0,"This seemed like a smaller store in comparison to most you find in the city.  However, even though it's small, it was still spacious. 

They were quick with making their orders.  It seems as if they know their customer.  As I was waiting in line, a customer walks in and the barista asked if they wanted their usual.  I think that's pretty cool.  It's something you hear of happening in the suburbs, not in the busy city, especially NYC.   I know it's weird, but that made me smile.  That's why this store gets a 4 star! lols

If you're looking to sit here and study, you're better off going to another location.  Seats are limited.  This is designed for the fast-paced new yorker's coffee craving."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2016-07-24,1.0,"I rarely write reviews, but I am appalled by the behavior of the employees here. I started going to this location in January when I moved into the area and most of my visits have been negative. The staff here has zero customer service but excel in the major attitude they all seem to share aside from two people (a young middle eastern man and a young petite girl with short hair and glasses).  My order takes forever even when it's not busy. One time It was completely dead and I waited by the pick up area for my drink for 5-7 minutes. The girl at the register couldn't seem to find the energy to open her mouth and tell me it was waiting where I placed my order. Instead she slid it across the counter to me when I went back up to the register to see if that's where my drink was. Another time the girl at the register actually laughed at me with a customer who was mocking me because I couldn't hear her calling me. These are just two examples, but I promise you there is nothing but tension and negative energy in there. I'm a quiet person with a simple order so it would be hard for me to believe they've pinned me for all of this attitude. I miss my old location on 81st and York. That location is just as busy but every employee works well together, smiles and remembers all of the customers. I will never go back to the location on third avenue for how uncomfortable they have made me feel."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2010-01-07,3.0,"It's here if you need it, and open from 6 AM during weekdays. The line can be long, especially in the morning but it moves quickly enough. Counter people are perky and courteous, and there are several seats and small tables towards the front. 

Also (I haven't seen this at other locations so far), but they sell whole boxes of macarons, those fancy french cookies, (at least 10 per box) in their refrigerated pastry section! 

So, nothing extraordinary about this particular Starbucks, but good to know that it's here."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2013-04-23,5.0,"Came to NY for a Model United Nations conference at the Hilton across the street, and I needed a place with internet to write an essay, since in the 21st Century hotels that charge $400/night still can't provide complementary wifi. Staff are super friendly at this 'bucks and coffee is par for the course. Place is constantly packed, but once you find a table you can stay all day.  I did."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2010-08-30,5.0,"This is my local Starbucks right by my job and I have to say that they have outstanding service in the mornings! There may be a long line but don't let that intimidate you because they have their system down packed. Behind the counter or even on the line, there usually is a staff person ready to call out your order before you get to the register to pay. Also, I find that the staff is always friendly and ready to crack a joke with you to get you to smile before your 1st cup of coffee."
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2012-11-07,5.0,"The food and drinks there are pretty much the same as the other Starbucks.

If you want to get some work done on your computer or want to charge your phone,  wifi is free and plus there are many outlets on the lower part of the seats along the wall.  If you are on a business trip and need to stop at a place where you can work on confidential matters on your computer for any reason, the seats along the wall will give you enough privacy; noone will be looking over your shoulder to see what you are doing,"

1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2010-03-10,4.0,"So i walk by 3 other starbucks in the morning to get to this one every morning 

I  am very willing to become a creature of habit if i am treated the right way and after a few times of going there the people behind the counter remembered my order and are always happy to see you and start your day with a bright hello

fyi ive gone a couple of different times, if you go from 8:50 - 9:10 expect there to be a line , but it does go pretty fast..if you can hold out and go at like 10:45 its usually practically empty  (thats usually when i go for my second cup!)"
1023,starbucks-new-york-373,2010-10-07,3.0,I don't usually go here during the peak morning hours. I've walked by and the long lines discourage me from walking in. I've gone in the afternoons with little wait. The service is OK but the bickering between the workers was unprofessional and a bit annoying to listen to while I was waiting for my cappuccino.
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2020-04-05,4.0,Friendly staff and a cozy Starbucks near my work. Good to do some work or just get coffee and relax.
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2019-10-01,2.0,"Unless you do mobile order you will wait a ridiculously long time for coffee. There's no reason you need to pay over $5 for coffee and wait over 20 minutes in the morning. It's unacceptable. Why have cashiers if the mobile orders take priority? 

There needs to be two sections/stations for baristas. One for mobile orders and one for walk ins."
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2020-02-09,1.0,"DO NOT GO TO THIS STARBUCKS!! Extremely dirty. I saw a roach crawling on someone. I informed the person and they ran out in horror. I told the staff and they acted like they didn't care, almost as if they were used to people complaining about roaches. To think they made my drink in that filth, and they probably have roaches in their supply storage. Obviously  I left."
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2019-08-27,1.0,"I was in there today and the girl making my drink just has the biggest attitude I go to other Starbucks and they are so nice and pleasant but this girl just has the worst attitude I have ever seen in a Starbucks she don't even say who's drink it is or anything u are just looking at labels to see if it is yours 
With her attitude I just don't want to go in there any more and they do have great food and coffee I guess they will loose my business any I have been going there for over 10 years now"
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2019-06-24,2.0,"Literally just left this location and wish I could return the frappe that was made for me. I ordered a grande matcha green tea frappe with 3 squirts of vanilla and whipped cream. Besides the frappe being a bit runnier than I'm accustomed to and having clear streaks of matcha powder, I STILL wasn't too pressed. It wasn't until I got to the end and noticed that the ice chips were actually chocolate chips! The guy that made my frappe clearly didn't rinse the blender! That's disgusting!"
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2018-05-28,1.0,"This Starbucks was the only one I've been to where I've been yelled at by a Barista. This was a horrible experience. I was only asking if there were any breakfast sandwiches left from the morning and the barista snapped in a harsh tone at me, ""No."" I went to the back of the line choose a different item and asked politely if there was a ham and cheese croissant and the cubby barista with glasses started screaming at me and made a scene. 

She was yelling, ""I already told you there ain't no breakfast sandwiches left!"" 

I had to interpret her by literally yelling, ""Plain croissant! Plain croissant! Plain croissant!"" 

Over and over again until this really emotional girl finally responded,  ""Just a plain croissant?"" 

I answered, ""Yes..."" At this point I really wanted to leave a regretted walking in. I couldn't believe I spent money here while getting yelled at. This also happened during my pregnancy... I don't know if this was discrimination or what but it was really a hurtful.  People even stopped talking and the whole store went quiet to see what was wrong. It was flat out embarrassing and a horrible experience. 

This girl's co-worker even told her in earshot, ""You shouldn't yell at customers.""

The Batista that yelled at my justified, "" She was asking for breakfast sandwiches and I told her there were none and she was asking for them again. She's stupid or something!""

I honestly used to love Starbucks and even worked for the company as a Batista in Seattle. I remember the customer experience being everything the company focuses on. This NYC Starbucks is a different story... It's sad.  I always feel bitter when I go to Starbucks now. I usually go only when my friends want to. I never choose to go alone since this occurrence... I complained to the company and they offered $10 for this embarrassing experience. I don't even think any amount could right this prejudice experience. Starbucks isn't the same as it was when I was growing up..."
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2018-12-01,5.0,"I walk in and they're playing Vanilla Ice, then Time after Time by Cyndi Lauper. Hell yes!

The barista this morning was super awesome, and kind to everyone that came in. The barista giving everyone their coffee was wishing everyone a great day, as well. 

While waiting for my drinks, someone accidentally took an online order, so they quickly ammended that issue for the customer even though it wasn't their fault. 

The place is also pretty clean. 

Not sure why they don't have higher stars, but the employees working right now are pretty wonderful!"
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2017-11-11,4.0,"This is a solid Starbucks location. My husband and I are in the area almost every weekend and usually have a coffee break in between errands. It's generally clean, spacious, and good service. Music is good and not too loud, which can be an issue at other locations. 

I like that when I come here on a Saturday evening we can usually find a seat to enjoy or coffee. There's nothing worse than coming in from the cold for a nice hot beverage, hoping to relax while sipping and the place is packed! 

It's also right across the street from Chase bank so we're usually able to kill 2 birds with one stone 

No complaints here. I'm a Starbucks lover and I am definitely a fan of this particular location. My husband and I have become regulars."
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2017-11-05,4.0,"it is funny how every Starbucks has its own personality. I go to one in Hartford almost every day and most days I feel like a stranger. This location, I come to every few months - and wow - I am greeted with a smile, they  check in that my order is correct , they  are fast and efficient.

I like to get here before I have to go into the office and sit an relax a bit - its a nice vibe in a busy place."

We came on a Saturday night around 6 when many public study spaces and cafes are closed. There wasn't that many people in here so our group of 4 was able to find a space. Can't say too much about number of outlets available. I'm from CA so I'm used to large starbucks with plenty of space to get my work done. Since moving here, I realized that's unlikely to find but here I am."

The Barista that took our order was nice and kindly explained to my daughter that she couldn't just get apples, she would have to buy the whole plate. The transaction was smooth and the drink was prepared quickly - whip cream and all! It wasn't too busy but we left right when the rain was starting so it probably picked up then. 

It was a good experience, the place was clean and everything was easy to read and find. The place is pretty spacious as well, plenty of seating."
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2017-01-20,4.0,"Clean and spacious Starbucks store that has standard service and food options. It is definitely one of the cleanest and most spacious of all the branches I've been to. It is not too noisy and definitely possible to find seats. 

The cake pops are HEAVEN. But they always run out of different flavors."
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2017-10-07,5.0,This is one of the nicest Starbucks I've been to in this area. Staff is super friendly and are quick!! I love their hot apple cider spice especially during the fall season.
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2016-01-08,5.0,"This might be my favorite Starbucks in Midtown. I mean on one hand, one is as good as another. On the other, these guys are fast, they've always got room (at least at the window) and they've been on point with all of my orders thus far. Plus, everyone here is so nice! Honestly that bit blows my mind the most. Further upsides include a great layout, good hygiene, and just a generally chill vibe to the whole place; something many Starbucks have kind of lost. 

Special nod to the employee in the sparkly scarf - she's the first to get my name right."
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2015-02-09,3.0,"I stop here just about every weekday on my way into the office.

Every day, the past month or so - hot coffee.
Every day, same question posed to me - do you want to try that on the Clover?  
Every day, same answer - no thanks, not today.

Don't get me wrong, I love the clover.  But one of the perks about getting hot coffee is that I can be in and out without waiting for the latte crowd, and given I am perpetually running late at this point in the morning...I just don't have the time.

Today was different.  Today I thought about it, and when I ordered that venti pike....I said yes to the clover.

The guy...didn't know what to do.  What?  Yes?  No?  Hey?  Did I win?  Did you say?  Seriously?  

However when the price went from $2.60 something to $4.50 something I laughed and said quickly said ohhh just the regular pike, kind sir.  What?  Wait?  Didn't you?  But?

If i'm going to spend that much on hot coffee it's going to be Hawaiian or Ethiopian fancy beans, or at the very least, Sumatra.  

Plus, this amusing exchange took up all my free time, and I was now running just as late as usual.  

So...maybe next time?

[The usual stuff - Convenient location, lots of baristas, plenty of seats, easy in/out for the AM crowd, generally never out of milk at the counter.  Everyone is super nice and they DO have clover, and when you have the time, it is delicious.]"
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2016-10-23,1.0,"I was in their around 6 p.m. on this past Saturday - there were a handful of customers sitting down.  I was not sure when they closed since the hours were not visible on the door as i entered.  I was also on a call, so may have missed that.  

I wandered about until my call ended and then I proceeded to the counter.  I was greeted by the gentleman by the register.  He was cheerful and polite.  Distracted with all the personal conversations he was having with his co workers that had nothing to do with work.  At least he was friendly.

I ordered my tall chai with almond milk.  There were about 4 to 6 customers ahead of me.  The man making the drinks appeared to be new because he had to ask how to make a drink and / or the difference between one term and another.  He two seemed distracted and moving at a pace showing little concern for the back up of drink orders.  As I stood there waiting 3 more people quickly placed orders and were now waiting.

One couple wanted a hot green tea and instead got a latte.  They had to wait almost 5 minutes to get that corrected once they brought it to the attention of the counter staff.  Someone apparently ordered the exact same drink as I did and jumped ahead and I had to then wait for 5 more minutes til the her order got made so I could finally grab my chai.  

When the tall chai was put down at the end of the counter I did not see where it was placed amongst the 4 other cups.  So I asked the barista which one was mine.  Apparently he didn't hear me so I asked a second time as he began to walk away, he cocked his head over his shoulder looking annoyed and sounding even more annoyed I bothered him with the question.  He barked out from 15 feet away saying it was ""that one"".  He was little to no help.  

The entire time there was a young woman who appeared to be either their manager or shift lead, who was standing at the end of the counter out of uniform ready to leave.  She was texting and interacting with the staff and they were asking her questions about whether or not they had product in house. 

As I finally retrieved my drink, I stepped towards her and asked her if she managed them and without skipping a beat I said how disappointing their behavior and attitude were.  Wished her luck and walked away.

I work in the hospitality industry and have managed people like that - not for very long - they don't last.  I would not stand idly by and watch quietly as they performed their duties with such a lack of consideration for the customers.  There were additional guests who had the wrong order made or none at all while I waited.  It was simply that they didn't care.  The staff simply wanted to sing the music playing and talk with one another.  I imagine this group was placed at this location on a saturday night because it is slow and they could not survive the rush periods but should not mean that they are allowed to fumble their way along and speak to guests in disrespectful and / or annoyed tones.

The chai was hot but the taste was weak.  Not sure why you serve something with little to no flavor.  Won't get that again."

I was on the line, and when I got a turn, the guy inside the counter said
""next gust"", but he didn't see me. He saw the women behind me.
He ingored me, but he took my order anyway because he had to do that.
But after that, I was waiting for my latte, but many people who ordered after me got their coffee next to another. I just order tall latte. Why I had to wait such a long time. I would never come back."
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2016-08-30,4.0,Ok place for coffee and to relax. You will get the same offering at this place as in other Starbucks. The good thing about this location is that you can enjoy watching busy people passing by through its clear windows.

Everytime I visit I feel welcomed, everyone knows my name, they know what I want to get and they make it perfect EVERY TIME. They're the hardest working baristas in this area. I love the whole staff including the shift supervisors but my favorite Barista's are Diane and Joshua!! Thanks for making my mornings worthwhile!"

It's only 7:25 & there's a line of 12 people who haven't moved an inch.  Guy in front of me for over 10 mins and two away from the front from ordering just got so pissed he walked out. Def time to find another hang.
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2015-08-31,3.0,"One of the largest starbucks I've visited. Sitting area has a long community table that can fit at least 20 people as well as 10 other round tables.

The baristas always look miserable and unfriendly, way to early be this rude when you work in coffee heaven if you asked me. The line is always long, but there's plenty of ppl behind the counter. Go figure! Any way, the place is well kept, free Wifi and plenty of place to seat and enjoy your drink, but I would rethink that if I were you."

What they do have is attitude so if you want to run in during your busy day to get agitated then this could be your spot.

I ordered an everything bagel and she gave me a French toast one that I wanted no part of.

I walked back into Starbucks and told her. She then replies, ""you didn't tell me which bagel you wanted so I just gave you whatever"".
I then told her, ""okay well wouldn't of it been nice to ask if you didn't think I told you which one I wanted?""
She then goes ""excuse me"" and I repeated myself and then she DOESN'T ANSWER ME AND WALKS AWAY!

It ends up that they didn't even have any of the bagel I wanted left so she probably did hear me but could care less and put in whatever they had thinking that I wouldn't realize until I left."

Walked in to a line of 3 people, ordered, stood standing for 5 min. wondered why I still haven't received my bagel and coffee. Did Starbucks employees job (named: Omari) and went to ask for my bagel then asked the barista to make my coffee. This place does not embody the core concept of Starbucks brand. Personally, I usually don't complain but this place really needs to retrain their staff.."
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2011-08-16,4.0,"This location is not bad, but sadly there's no power outlets.

I was really surprised to hear the workers bumpin their own music instead of the typical Starbucks mix.  You'd hear a bunch of hip-hop, reggae and r&b instead of your standard (boring) jazz music.   

I kinda felt bad for them because I kept seeing customers come in, drink their coffees and leave everything on the table for the employees to clean.   Since when was Starbucks a seated restaurant?  Geez, I'd be pretty annoyed if I had to clean up after people too.  Starbucks should be considered public space and leaving garbage behind is the equivalent of littering in public or clubbing baby seals - it's a crime against your fellow man.

The bathroom was pretty clean and there's a decent amount of seating - not surprising since laptop folks can't linger too long without a power cord."

Starbucks may not have the best coffee, but it was decent coffee and it didnt matter which starbucks I went to I could count on what I'm used to at Starbucks.  Not in this one.  Twice!  First Cafe Latte was brown water, second was foamy brown water and I did something I have only done at Dunkin...I threw my coffee away. One star."

These guys do a really great job working the line and pushing out drinks efficiently with minimal delays and mess-ups. They are also very friendly. The people at the cashiers greet me by name now, which always brightens my day (goes to show how often I go there, probably a little too much). They work really hard and definitely deserve credit for their handling of the morning rush. Especially the guy at the iced coffee station churning out cups for all us thirsty, cranky, and sweaty New Yorkers. You rock, iced coffee guy. *fistbump*"
1024,starbucks-new-york-218,2016-01-18,1.0,"This is the absolute WORST Starbucks I have ever been to! I spend my time traveling whether inside the US or out, and the one thing I have always loved about Starbucks is their astounding customer service! This location definitely ruins the good name of the brand! While I was placing my order for breakfast for three, the girl taking the order did not bother to even look at me while arguing with another employee about the holidays Starbucks honors (or something of that sort but they mentioned 7 holidays) because of the lack of attention to me, she got two of my items wrong! I ordered 3 coffees, she charged me for two, one of them was supposed to be skinny (I hate when my latte is sweet) and it wasn't! I also ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and was shocked when I got home, almost no cheese and made with white bread? Might as well have made it at home!!!! Anyhow, when I decided to ask for my third coffee, the barista was incredibly rude and said 'you were only charged for two, so you need to order it again' WOW! By far I don't mind paying the ridiculous $6 that a coffee is in here, but at any other Starbucks they would've said 'oh my bad so sorry here's your coffee on the house'
If I could give 0 stars I definitely would!!!!"

It is a super small shop in Hells Kitchen so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you want to sit down and work or looking to catch up with a friend. The staff was super friendly and it was refreshing to see people who actually were happy to be at work. I went with the Oat Milk Latte and added in the fresh vanilla flavoring that they were advertising at the counter. The latte was so delicious, not too sweet and the perfect pick me up to keep me going. 

Taking one star off because the drink was nearly $6 and the drip coffee was pricier than other spots in the area so I couldn't see myself coming here throughout the week but will definitely be back to try a regular cup of coffee."
1025,birch-coffee-new-york-16,2019-09-17,5.0,"I loved this cute little coffee shop. There's almost no seating, but it doesn't feel super cramped even with a line. And boy is there a reason for the line. The baristas are upbeat and welcoming, the coffee is made quickly, is beautiful and instagram-worthy, and tastes incredible. Their roasters have done an excellent job, as the espresso does not have an acidic flavor. 
The barista's recommendation of the iced hemp latte was the favorite, but the hot oat milk latte was also fantastic."
1025,birch-coffee-new-york-16,2019-12-17,4.0,"The aesthetic of the coffee shop is really cute! It's clean and easy to find. The coffee shop itself is tiny. It only has about 4 bar seats. So it is not a place to study or meet up with friends, but the spot to stop by and grab a coffee on the way to Columbus Circle or around that area. They have a good selection of different non-dairy milk including oat milk and hemp. They do latte art on the coffees, even if the latte art doesn't stay intact as you drink the coffee down it is nice to have. The had background music at a good level that was fitting to the environment. The baristas are friendly and easy to talk to about coffee. They made my coffee so quickly I had barely sat down to pull my book out and they had already called my name. If I am in the area again soon I'll be back."

I had an iced latte (unfortunately they don't have any flavorings like vanilla, they only have mocha and chai). But overall it was pretty good!

It's a small place with no places to sit FYI."

Super small space (only like two seats) but very very good coffee and they had their fair share of baked goods. It's the classic pick-up-your coffee and go kind of spot. I got a fantastic americano and my friend got a cappuccino - you can tell they use very good beans and they really do it right! 

It was a great pit stop during a cold NYC day. Don't expect to sit here for too long since they don't have much seating but your a New Yorker, you got things to do anyways! And if not, grab a coffee and go explore the ever touristy Times Square and midtown area nearby."
1025,birch-coffee-new-york-16,2018-09-30,5.0,"Hey customers, let's remember a couple of things. Come into the store, order a coffee. Or decide not to order a coffee and walk out. Or ask a question and then make a decision. But don't come in and give the barista a hard time just because you're having a bad day! You don't like the products they're offering? Great! It's NYFC, so you can go to any of the other cafes or delis in the block. Luckily, it's a small cafe, so even the jerkiest customers order to go and then leave.
Customer behavior aside, the espresso is excellent, they have soy and oat milk, and prices are definitely cheaper than at the chain across the street."

It was a lifesaver for the grueling long days of my conference. Finding it was a little bit hard but the search resulted in great cups of coffee. There's a decent selection of pastries. The cheese scone is my fave amongst what was on offer. Though if you're in NYC, you probably want a bagel."
1025,birch-coffee-new-york-16,2020-02-19,5.0,Great coffee. The shop doesn't really have space to sit down and stuff. But the beans are great. The foam was smooth and rich. Everything was great about my latte. The staff there were super nice too.

1025,birch-coffee-new-york-16,2018-02-06,5.0,"Small but mighty!

Tiny location about the size of my studio apartment's bathroom but smells way better.

Two wee spots by the window for a quick sip on the way out.

Hopefully they'll soon participate in the CUPS app here!

But you're here to have the most delicious espresso-style coffee in the city.  Made at the perfect temperature by relatively pleasant staff (hey, they get up hella early!)

Personally my most fav is that they have oat milk (yes it's an extra charge boo hoo). Try it - you'll be shocked how delish it is!

Long live Birch!"

It is a cold brew, not an iced coffee, why is there ice. Ice waters it down, also chills it to the point that you aren't able to taste the full flavor profile.

Originally rated this as one star due to how dissappointed I was with ice in the cold brew, seems like that is standard around here."

HEADS UP: There is NO seating to study or relax and chat with friends. The shop is extremely tight, with only a handful of people fitting inside at a time. 

The store consists of only the walk-up counter and some standing space. It does have two stools and a small counter for seating against the window, but I'd personally recommend taking the coffee for a walk over the Columbus Circle to take in the views and be Park."

1025,birch-coffee-new-york-16,2018-02-08,5.0,So thankful that Birch opened a location in Midtown West. 9th Avenue needed a solid coffee shop like pizza needs cheese. They have delicious coffee that competes with the best cups in New York. This location is very small. Probably could only fit 6 customers at a time small. There's a few bar stools to sit at by the window I would say it's more for a quick rest than a spot to work on your novel.
1025,birch-coffee-new-york-16,2018-05-18,5.0,"Hands down, probably one of the best coffees in the city. Loved the silky, creamy texture of soy latte; good people, great coffee. Also try the almond toasted iced tea, yum. These guys know how to make a good coffee."

1025,birch-coffee-new-york-16,2019-10-01,5.0,"My go-to place for coffee. The service is very quick and friendly, and the baristas know their customers and their usual orders. I'm not sure if that's a sign I go there too often or if they're just that good. I have only had an iced latte with regular whole milk from there because it is my favorite coffee drink no matter the place, but I'm thinking of branching out to other types of milk or other drinks on the menu if I'm feeling frisky. The food is good, although not something that I end up craving. I get something different from the baked goods every time because I haven't found my food staple there yet. The place is clean, but very small, so if you want to sit in you have to get there at an off-time when most people are not getting coffee (avoid the morning or the midday) The lines can get long around those times but because it's a quick service place it gets empty again pretty quickly. The cups that hot drinks come in are beautiful, and I think they're recyclable? Although I'm not too sure about that. They used to use lids that did not require straws but now they do not. I think they might get back to that when it's time to order more lids, but I haven't checked in with the employees on that yet. Also the tip jar is a really creative and innovative way to get tips lol. There's a question of the day and you put your tip into the jar that you think has the correct answer. The answer is on the board the next day. The sign outside the door is also usually very fun and witty. The music selection is also really nice. There are usually stickers on the front counter that you can grab. They also offer a student discount and have a punch card where your 10th drink is free. All these extras just make it a pleasant experience overall, but if you are a no frills type of person who wants to just get their coffee and go Birch is amazing for that as well."
1025,birch-coffee-new-york-16,2018-08-06,2.0,The ambiance is right and the service was quick. Unfortunately the iced coffee was weak to the point that it was overpowered by a splash of milk. I think I would have preferred one of the many carts in the area.
1025,birch-coffee-new-york-16,2018-07-16,5.0,Thrilled about this place.  Phenomenal soy milk latte - best I've ever had.

Wish we could sit down as many friends that work in the area would love to take have normal cup of coffee as we did pre pandemic.

Many medical staff staying at nearby hotels love having this place to turn to when they come back from their shifts. Thanks to their tip. I thought all coffee shops were closed."

1. We paid $16 for two small juices the equivalent of two talls from Starbucks.

2. They have us a paper straw which came undone before I could finish my drink.

We got several flavors and they were ok. Keyword OK."

The substituted Cafe Americano was weak.

The blueberry muffin was good.

But on a jam packed Saturday night the wait for the restroom was ridiculous.  There is a single unisex bathroom and the line was at least ten deep. 

Holy grit your teeth, Batman.

And the loud rap music didnt help either..."
1026,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-13,2019-09-06,3.0,"Pricey but authentic!!

I needed a detox after the weekend and my friends mentioned this place! I got the açaí bowl with protein powder and spinach. 

The bowl itself was a little small for the price, but I understand that it was probably a proper portion size for an average consumer. From a taste standpoint, the granola was good and not overbearing and the açaí was more sour than sweet. In my opinion, I prefer it this way because it leads me to believe that they used pure açaí and no added sugars! In other words, the bowl tasted very natural and minimalistic, which I appreciated.

I also got a small cold brew with coconut milk. Again, the coffee was smaller than I expected for the price, but it did the trick and tasted like decent cold brew. 

This wasn't my favorite place because it was expensive and I left a little hungry. However, that is more on my part than theirs- they deliver what they promise, which is food/drink made from high-quality, raw, nutritious ingredients. 

If anything, Joe & the Juice is authentic. 

Side note: I regretted not getting a juice, considering that this place is known for them. I tried my friend's and it was delicious, so I would definitely recommend trying one!"
1026,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-13,2019-06-08,3.0,"Joe & The Juice has really expanded so much and it was about time I give it a try! I was in the area and what better drink to have on a hot day than a fresh-made juice!
I went with Hell of a Nerve (~$8) which included strawberry, banana, and elderflower. The juice was light, fresh, and not too sweet. Overall, the drink was good but absolutely not worth around $8. It wasn't even a big size cup.
This place seems like just another overpriced juice spot. I would consider giving it another try, but I'm hesitant to come back because of how disappointing it was."
1026,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-13,2019-10-28,2.0,It sucks because I enjoyed my shake (for the 3 seconds I had it before I finished it) this was the smallest cup ever. Smaller than a tall at Starbucks and it was $8. I couldn't believe it. I had it to go and was done by the time I made it to the door lol.

Every drink has a very fancy name but it tastes like juices that you can make at home. I make one at home time to time and it tastes pretty darn similar to what i had tasted from the drink that i purchased here lol. 

Just add sugar syrup, water, ice, and some fruits and it will give you the flavor of the juices! 

Ugh, save your money and time. Go somewhere else for a better choice."
1026,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-13,2020-03-08,1.0,Don't come here. Overpriced and within the first sip i was disappointed. I got the vegan shake with plant protein. No flavor and it wasn't even cold.

Smoothies are not worth the price tag, but okay spot if you buy the smoothie in order to study here or hang out for several hours. Lounge area is quite nice. There are outlets and backpack hooks.

The guys behind the counter seemed in disarray. They weren't very welcoming, but that could be because they were running around like chickens who lacked communication. We waited for our order behind a girl who had been waiting for food, and she waited, and it turns out that they given her order to someone else, so we awkwardly watched two employees argue about it. One angrily asking the other what happened to the sandwich he had placed there and the other unsure of anything.

Once we received our orders, we briefly sat. I didn't enjoy my juice one bit. It was very frothy, and I wasn't into the graininess, which I understand happens when juice is not strained. As we sat, our name was called again, so my bf went to check why and turns out amongst the employees' confused work flow, they had made both our drinks twice. They tossed the duplicated drinks. Leaves me wondering how often they make mistakes having witnessed and experienced two during our very short stay here."

I'm certainly not a juice connoisseur and the many fruit combinations can be a little overwhelming first time in so probably not a bad idea to check out the menu online first.  Since I needed a late afternoon boost, I went with the Pick Me Up and a cappuccino.  The Pick me up is raspberry, banana and apple.  Decent enough and I should have realized up front the raspberry would make it grainy.  Cappuccino was average but all in all decent enough.  A few shake options on the menu I wouldn't mind trying and since the space inside is very comfortable I'll stop back in."

I got a small Power Shake, which is strawberry, banana, and vanilla milk. It had the perfect amount of sweetness and a great strawberry flavor. My friends both got a Sex Me Up Shake that has passion fruit, apple, and ginger. Any drink with ginger is usually overpowered by it this one was well balanced and very tasty. It was kinda cramped and they only had one restroom so my friends and I were in line for almost 20 minutes waiting to use it. Other than that, great! A cute little photo opportunity as well."
1026,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-13,2019-10-14,3.0,"Expensive? Yes. But, the drinks are good and there's some neat combinations. The first time I went I got the Mint Banana with Vanilla Milk, which was delicious but after going a second time about a year later it was no longer on the menu. Instead I got the Avocado Shake, which was like $10 and it was good but nothing phenomenal. 

There are definitely less healthy options to have for breakfast or afternoon snack, and Joe and the Juice gets the job done and it's a nice open space even though I've only had the drinks and not the food."

Came with a colleague to grab a drink mid afternoon and there was a fairly sizeable line - expected given the location.  We placed our orders and it took about 20 minutes before my colleague got his drink.  Still waiting for mine but I ordered a drip coffee so perhaps that takes a bit longer, but I was starting to lose patience.  Then I saw folks who ordered after us get called for their drinks and thought, OK, not cool.  Asked one of the staff and they just looked confused.  Ran around trying to figure it out - looks like they forgot my order all together.  Pours me a cup and asks what milk I wanted, to which I responded ""whole"".  He looks in the fridge and asks ""is 0% OK?""  Buddy, that's the complete opposite of what I asked for!  Doesn't even offer me another option and proceeds to pour into my cup.  At this point, I was done and just wanted my drink so I can finally get out of the place.  Took a sip and pretty sure it was regular old watered down coffee - tasted like trash.  Couldn't even get myself to go back and ask for a remake because I knew that would lead to nowhere.  Tossed it after I walked out and took the L.  *major face palm*  Pains me to see how popular this place is given it's service and quality but again, highly trafficked by tourists so it is what it is."

We ordered a Youngblood, which it's main ingredient is Celery, the juice guys had a contest of how fast they can shove fruit or vegetables into the juice machine. Squirted something from a bottle into the cup as well.
Upon receiving the drink which they claim they made in 3 3 seconds, who knows what was in there, the drink came out completely yellow, we asked if there was any sweetener and if there was celery in the juice and everything the order taker answered was celery no sweetener.

I am diabetic and felt like I could pass out after because I'm sure whatever they squirted in there was a sweetener.

You are messing with people's lives joking around and playing games with food people are consuming. 

Obviously the owner doesn't care since everyone one of his places is barely over 2 stars, 

Joke and play as much as you want I'm sure at some point your employees will carelessly play games with someone's food and something serious will happen."

This location isn't as big and cozy as their other one in the financial district but they still make some really good drinks.

We both went for shakes this time and although my choco shake was good, it wasn't as good as my latte shake from last time.

Since I just landed I wanted something light so decided to go with a juice - Go Away Doc (ginger carrot apple).  Juice was good and it hit the spot although it was a bit steep price-wise for the size.  

The next morning I decided to go get breakfast and ordered two lattes.  I took a sip of my latte and it tasted off so I asked if the staff if she can remake it but she just looked at me like I was crazy and asked me if the other one was the same and if it tasted the same as the first one then that's just how it is.  I was a bit surprised by her response and decided it wasn't worth dealing with it and left.  Ended up going to a Starbucks nearby an hour later.

The place was also a bit of a mess.  I guess a patron earlier made a mess eating breakfast at one of the tables during my 2nd visit to this location, but no one came by to wipe or clean it up.  Don't think the staff cares too much in general."

Visit date: October 14, 2017
First time? Yes.

After a night of way too much food, I wanted something fresh. We stopped at Joe and the Juice for some fruit-filled delights. I had the Breakfast Club - it had a blend of acai, avocado, banana, and almond milk, and was layered with hemp granola. It was super filling but not heavy. The blend wasn't too sweet (I'm thinking they don't add any sweetener) which paired really well with the crunchy granola bits. I also had a chocolate fiber muffin, which was a little on the mushy/bread pudding side, but it made me feel energized for the day. 

The café itself is welcoming, the workers super nice and friendly, and the LOVE sculpture is right outside so you can check that off your tourist bucket list while sippin' on some smoothie goodness."

After waiting 20 minutes, I went to check on my drink and found out that ""no one had picked up my order."" Might I suggest a more efficient system? They currently jot your name down on flimsy pieces of paper. I'm sorry...I thought this was 2019?

I'll be taking my business elsewhere. Unfortunately, I don't have 20 minutes to waste on a busy New York morning."

No explanation to how we were ""supposed"" to pick up our order, and when I went to pick up a sandwich of mine, without saying anything the barista grabs the sandwich from my hands and tells me to wait until they tell me I can pick it up. Very short and rude, even for new york. 
The ambiance is very cool and swanky. Loud pop music. The baristas were having a fun time and smiling behind the counter, but none of those smiles were directed at any of the customers. Mostly clean seating area. 
Also, $3.50 for a black coffee"

They have a variety of juices, fruit milkshakes, and coffee, along with some sandwiches and other bites. I was pleased to hear that they were offering their lunch menu, even though it was only 8:30 am.

I ordered the ""hell of a nerve"" smoothie, a strawberry banana drink, and Joe's club, a chicken sandwich with tomato and pesto. Really enjoyed the smoothie, which was blended well and featured actual juice and not some powdery foolishness. The sandwich was good, although I have to say the bread was a good bit crunchier than expected.

The coffee was pretty standard, which is a let down given the cafe's popularity. They offer 4 different cup sizes (starting at 4oz!) which I appreciated. However, the ambience makes up for it. 
With large windows and comfortable seating, this location is perfect to take a breather and watch the people of Midtown stroll (or should I say run?) by. And if people watching isn't your thing, there are plenty of tables to do your work or chat with friends.
This location is also right next to the ""LOVE"" sign and you can in fact see the multitude of people getting their instagram photos with the sign, which can be amusing at times.
Service was great - Young and friendly staff who got me my drink very quickly!

The flat panini bread is very thin, but good. I liked the pesto a lot. I wasn't a fan of the serrano and luckily (??) there was hardly any meat on the sandwich anyway... hardly any cheese or avocado or tomato either?...

I was not impressed at all. I would not get another sandwich here...there was hardly anything on it and it was more  expensive then the sandwiches at D&S Deli that wind up lasting me 2 lunches.

Other than the food...the atmosphere was chaotic. LOUD rap music. So loud that the guy behind the counter could barely hear me. 

My least favorite thing about this place is that every single person behind the counter had a beard/facial hair, hair down, etc and were making the food/juices. It wasn't tied back, no hair nets, etc. Just grossed me out. 

As far as trying the juice goes, I will stick with the cart in front of 1345...$5 gets you a great juice and here it is much more expensive...

Very ""hipster-type"" type place and just not for me."

People who were behind us in line were getting there orders before us and we politely asked twice if they were making our order and they sort of just brushed us off. When I finally saw them making the yogurt, it took two seconds for them to make so I don't understand why they couldn't have done that way earlier. As for the latte, the guy had me pour the milk in myself...not to sound rude, but isn't it their job to prepare the food? I've never heard of the barista asking the customer to prepare the drink...My boyfriend insists his smoothie was tasty, so that's why I decided on 3 stars, but overall i didn't find the experience worth it.

Joe & The Juice is like Equinox in cafe form. When I need a caffeine pick-me-up in the morning or early afternoon, the last thing I want is being greeted by pounding music and overly upbeat and singing employees shouting ""YOLO"" and ""whaddaaaaap."" The juice and coffee did their job and are definitely nothing to get excited about.

Joe & The Juice just tries too hard to be hip and trendy. You can only hide behind high ceilings and design aesthetics for so long when your core products just okay and definitely overpriced.

1027,paris-baguette-new-york-10,2018-10-31,5.0,"Baking scares the shit out of me.  It's too precise.  If I can't cook something with twelve pints inside me, I probably won't try to make it.  And this is just when you want a mediocre product.

Just getting an average, technically acceptable baked good takes a level of focus and precision practiced by Walter White.  Culinary-wise, I'm more of a Saul Goodman.  I'll grab a bunch of ingredients with my bare hands and you'll be puzzled and concerned.  But, a few hours later, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  I'll stop short of taking a dump through a sun-roof, though.*  

Much flour has probably been wasted experimenting to arrive at just the level of flaky and pillowy this croissant chicken sandwich boasted. Think for a minute about how a sandwich enters your mouth.  The top and bottom of the bread product is what the maximum surface area of your mouth is exposed to.

The teeth, the hard palate, and your tongue all make contact with the croissant first. This croissant was flaky, just a tad buttery, but held firm for the most part. Then I bit down into it and it was both pliable and gluten-y but also soft.  Many croissants are, but this was just the right balance between the two physical properties.

I'm sure these properties interact like graphs with both an x and a y-axis. Somewhere on that graph is a sweet spot, a confectioner's golden co-ordinate, that only the best recipes and techniques can hit.  This croissant landed on that spot like a horse on the grass when a fat guy gets on.  As if that wasn't enough, the chicken breast was juicy and well-seasoned, the cheese was creamy, milky even, and just a little tangy.

Feel free to call me all the homophobic slurs you want but I removed the bacon.  I wouldn't blame you.  Personally, I too would judge someone who took America out of their sandwich after knowingly ordering it.  Have some balls and stand behind your decision, I say.  But with the cheese and the chicken working in harmony together while standing in perfect contrast to the flaky croissant, there was no need for two entire strips of bacon.

Instead, I just took a few bites here and there to add a crispier mouth-feel when I reached the softer middle of the croissant.  Unpatriotic as it was, it worked fine.  My simple lunch triggered a long, contemplative thought process about how some genius might have arrived at such a perfect croissant.

I imagine some cranky perfectionist in Provence well over 300 years ago churning out many shitty croissants that looked more like guano than food.  The price of innovation is often paid by those close to it.  He probably had to eat the freak croissants and gained weight. I bet his horse crapped itself every time he walked out.  Not out of fear, just so it wasn't carrying any unnecessary weight.

He might have even lost his shit from time to time and his poor wife and kids would have to cover their ears and duck as weird bread and curse words flew out of the kitchen.  And as a shit-shaped confection would bounce off little René's head, he would hear,

""Fuck zees!  FUCK.  ZEEES!""

But one day, he got it.  He knew when he got it.  He'd been visualizing it for months.  I see him bringing a tray of what we now enjoy from Paris Baguette to the bed, bending down and offering the trembling family a bite to lure them out from under it.  I might never know who the persistent, abusive genius was but domestic turmoil is a fair trade for excellent baked goods.

1027,paris-baguette-new-york-10,2018-11-05,4.0,"I like this place because they have a wide variety of options in terms of baked goods, cakes, and sandwiches. It's a similar concept like tous les jours where you have a tray and place baked goods that you want on the tray and pay at the cash register. The pastries and cakes are fair in price, especially for the quality you get. Also, there is a wide selection, variety and some flavors are pretty unique here. 

There are nine stools in this shop, so it's pretty tiny but if you come early enough you'll definitely grab a seat. My only issue with this place is that they open at 6:30 am on weekdays, but they don't stock most of their baked goods until 7-7:30 am. So you can stop in and grab a cup of coffee but you'll have to wait if you want the goods."

I can live off croissants, here they're delicious and reasonably priced. They have the traditional ones plain, almond and chocolate. However, I noted that they have garlic minis, I'll have to try those with one of their salads. They also have sandwiches too. There's a small area to enjoy your purchase, but I've always taken my stuff to go as it's usually breakfast, speaking of that they have egg sandwiches too.

Between two people: their version of a cronut, a cupcake, banana/blueberry french toast, a kiwi smoothie, and a hot chocolate ($15 altogether). What makes their pastries different is that each one is filled with something. I found each of the pastries a little on the hard side (except for the cronut) and a bit too sweet. The kiwi smoothie has an intense fruit flavor, with again, a lot of sugar....same for the hot chocolate.

This place certainly delivers for the sweet tooth, but if you're coming here then balance out the meal better. I suggest a bitter coffee to go with any one of the baked items. Limited seating in the back, so might have to take to go."

1027,paris-baguette-new-york-10,2016-06-19,4.0,"Visiting from Canada, there's none of the Korean chain bakeries there so when I saw Paris Baguette, I was super excited. I am a huge fan of Paris Baguette, because they are everywhere in Korea, plus they have inexpensive pastries. I had time to spare before dinner so I wanted to buy some desserts to eat afterwards. 

In Korean bakeries, you basically grab a tray, a pair of tongs, and start picking out whatever you like! They had an enormous selection of slices of cakes, pastries, and juices. They had a blueberry chiffon cake slice and it was so cute that I couldn't pass it up. It was delicious! One reason why I like Korean desserts is because they aren't sweet and taste very simple. Korean desserts don't have frosting, but rather have an unsweetened whip cream, which I like. The slice was huge and I believe I got it for less than $5.

There was also Mango Pudding!! This is one of my favourite desserts so I was so excited. It was in a mini glass jar, packaging +1. When I tried it, I was super disappointed because it wasn't mango pudding. It was like creme caramel and I felt that the syrup was too sweet for me."

For pastries, grab a tray and tongs and pick away! The pastries I bought (one had a raspberry and cream cheese filling, my weakness!) was good and fresh but nothing memorable. Pastry prices are reasonable and the selection of sandwiches and pastries is good considering the small space.

Paying is confusing though because there are two open registers and one person. You may have to assert yourself if someone tries to pay ahead of you. Just tap your inner New Yorker. lol.

No coffee cause I ain't walking around juggling a bunch of cups filled with hot liquid . For a small cart they did have a large selection of eats and prices are cheap skates friendly .

As I slowly approached this cart, I was able to see a menu that placed on the side of the cart. They have French Toast, Pancakes, Breakfast Platters etc and all looks good. 

Two Eggs any style $3, add Ham $1.25, Cheese Omelet $4, I couldn't believe where I were to get a breakfast. 

I had Two Sunny Side Eggs, Home fries, and Toast. Then I also ordered a cup of coffee.  I gave them $5, and still got change with a bill. 

A man & woman who work in the cart seem to have pride to serve a good food. 
My breakfast platter was so good and satisfying.  
Although this place was so busy, she made sure to check everything I ordered before I took off.

This a great place to go for breakfast in Midtown East area. Not to be confused with Quick Stop Kosher food truck or cart. This is one more that is a cart.  47th St and Lexington seems to be main location. Great specials for breakfast, they leave around 11 Am and are there since 5 Am.

For this area prices are not that bad. I have had two egg whites with cheese and tomato on whole wheat bread for only $2.75.
They also have donuts for 75 cents, Low fat Yogurt Muffins for $1.25, Red Bull for $2.50, Hot Chocolate (small) for $1.00, and Large Coffee for $1.50.
Also, They have breakfast platters that are good: Two eggs any style with ham, bacon or sausage for $2.75. It is served with Home Fries and Toast.
My favorite is the Hungry Man special, that is three eggs with Potatoes, Ham, Sausage and Cheese on a Roll for $5.00.  Also I get small cofee or mini- Sunny D bottle with it, some times.

Got 6 doughnuts in a box. 
I haven't tried them yet, they are going home with me to Connecticut, but I am doomed~! I have been a big fan of Doughnut Planet store, as I nicknamed them since my Tokyo days! And I believe they have the best doughnuts on this planet! So, I hope my box doesn't disappoint. 

Update: They were every bit as delicious as I remembered them to be, if not more! So pleased!"
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2020-03-09,4.0,"If you ever need a pick-me-up right before a Metro North ride on a late Friday jammed with other grumpy commuters, look no further than the Doughnut Plant stand. I've waxed poetic about these donuts in another review but can I just say they taste even more transcendent when unpacked in a train compartment and the aroma of sweet yeasty dough fills the air and everyone tries to conceal their jealousy at the sight of you slowly tucking into a PB and banana. 

Anyway, here's the rundown of everything that I've crammed into my bag. I'll spare everyone pictures of sad, rumpled donuts but that did not take anything away from the taste:

1. PB and jelly. Still my go-to, along with the creme brulee. The PB and jelly will bring you right back to childhood school lunches. Very thick and possibly best to split with someone who loves PB. 

2. PB and banana. I think the jelly pairs a lot better but I just ate an extremely fresh PB/banana so ... it evens out somewhere. 

3. Blackberry. As you can probably tell, I'm extremely partial to the jelly filled ones. 

4. Valrhona chocolate. Puts all other chocolate glazed donuts to shame. I will say, though, that it's a bit less sweet/sugary than the other donuts. My mom in particular (who hates dessert) liked this one. 

5. Vegan chocolate donut. It's excellent ... for a vegan pastry. I would fail a blindfold test badly but I can't justify knowingly passing up the other ones for a vegan option. 

One last pro-tip: grab a bottle of ice cold milk to eat with the donut. I loathe milk and the only time I'll drink it is as a very necessary accompaniment to these donuts. 

My tiny gripe is that these babies are expensive (about $4-5 per donut) and I once saw this guy almost cry at the register when he had to fork over $50 for like a dozen donuts."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2020-03-08,5.0,"The freaking blueberry donut was the best donut ive tasted in quite some time. It literally was EVERYTHING blueberry. I was chewing bits of blueberry and was blown away at how flavorful the donuts were. I also had the red velvet donut and it was good as well, it just wasn't hitting like the blueberry donut. 

GO...your palate will thank me later!!!"
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2020-01-05,4.0,"I love DP. So should you. Perhaps the best in North America. Unique and amazing. 

Everyone in NYC loves a little DP. Not just girls, guys too. Guys can enjoy DP as much as girls. I've been in DPs in both Manhattan and Brooklyn and the guys love getting DP too. I can't blame them. If you haven't had DP lately, then let's do DP together soon.

This is the Doughnut Plant store inside Grand Central Station, and while you will get the typically delicious and very unique original DP Donuts which were once life changing for me, you will also get extraordinary high prices. They're still clearly 5 star donuts, but for the fact that this is now a city-wide chain and that this stand wasn't up to the standards of others, but with prices similarly through the roof, I deduct a single star. But read on if you want to know how amazing the donuts are in general at DP and which to order.

Also it's very cool to find this at GCS because DP is so quintessentially NYC (new New York if you like), and there isn't a more perfect donut choice to have in here.

Best Donuts: Tres Leches, Creme Brulee, Coconut.
Are they healthy: No. Try running a mile after eating all 3 of those.
Why?: So I can hear your ""Doughnut Pant.""
Oh. I see. Another bad joke: Well would you rather talk politics?
Sure. Are you unbiased or partisan? What is your world view?: The view of doughnuts. I give everything a ""Doughnut Slant.""
Why do you keep rambling about doughnuts?: I love a good ""Doughnut Rant.""
Look, let's walk and talk, I'm in a hurry: I can walk and talk, but my ""Doughnut Can't.""
Doughnuts are all you talk about: You should hear my ""Doughnut Chant.""
Well at least you don't recycle jokes: Oh! What a good idea! I'll get right on that.

Another location of this ever-expanding New York staple. I once I fell in love with the donuts at the Grand Street location. Since then so many others have opened up that it has watered down the quality and the prices have gone up. The donuts are still excellent though and I still really enjoy and love them. Some more than others. You have to try them to understand how amazing they are. Nothing like any donuts you had before.

I've been to DP on Grand St in Manhattan about 10 times, and the Brooklyn location too. It's the best one, and the best doughnuts imaginable.

The last time I was here, I brought a guy and a girl. It was just us 2 guys and 1 girl. It was an awesome DP experience.

They may just be the best donuts you will ever taste, anywhere. They are so innovative and original. Simply unlike any other doughy concoction you will ever taste anywhere. DP is gourmet and fancy, and yet they're just donuts. The Creme Brulée and Trés Léchés (overusing accent on purpose) are my faves, and must be tried to be believed, but the Coconut is not far off. Tres Leches means three milks. Which is why you find it at DP. Think about it.

The first time I did DP I actually filmed it. I mean, anyone doing this DP for the first time, should capture it on film. It's just that good. Somebody broke in and stole the footage, but I'm sure it'll never come back to bite me. Speaking of biting. DP and biting were never synonymous before. They are now.

DPs can be expensive. But it's so worth it. Ask anyone who is a DP regular.

What makes them so different? The dough is different. The tastes are so unusual. They're a little small, but perhaps most uniquely, they're filled with some sort of goo. Often a creamy goo, that isn't so much a filling, but a hidden element of a perfect dough. Like a little goo cavern, an underwater river running through the very heart of the donut. Unexpected and delightful. Filled with taste. Pure doughnut bliss.

DP is all about sharing. Letting at least two other people have some. DP is so good it can become addictive. And DP is for adults, not kids. Most kids just don't ""get"" DP. Don't introduce your spouse to DP. They might love it too much. You might ""lose them"" to DP addiction. And that goes for parents too. If you show your Mama DP, then first of all, it's just not right. Secondly, what if she loves it as much as you do? Then your Mama is a DP addict. What will your friends think? Will you admit to them that you were the one that introduced her to DP?

I said years ago, I'm sure that within 10 years there'll be a Doughnut Plant rip-off in every major town and it's slowly becoming true, soon they'll be in every gas station and Walmart a la Dunkin and Krispy Kreme. We'll all be getting DP'd before long.

But for now, you can only get this here. So do the right thing. Get your arse to New York City and get DP'd. Well you know what I mean. I sh** you not when I say these are the best I've ever had. I'm not sure who in their right mind would not want some DP action, see for yourself why DP is the most delicious and exciting thing you can enjoy in New York City. Forget DKNY. It's all about DPNY. I'll show you. Later.

I love DP."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2020-01-08,4.0,"Stumbled upon the location at Grand Central Terminal.  The mini donuts are delicious! The carrot cake was nearly orgasmic( yes I said it).  I am only sorry to report that the red velvet was horrible.  Didn't taste like red velvet at all. It tasted more like a cherry flavored donut. My daughter ordered one and was disgusted. At first I thought she was losing her mind because I was making palative love to my carrot cake donut.  I took a bite and spit it out.

Anyway.  This is just all so honest. I wish I could try some other flavors because I'm sure they are all amazing.  Two out of three for us still gets 4 stars because  that's how delicious the two we liked were.  Plus the guy working was so helpful and patient."

The doughnuts can be good, especially the Red Velvet and the Peanut Butter and Jelly. Others, eh.

I also got their straight-up marizipan cake donut, and the frosting hits the spot without being too decadent. (Well, you are already eating a donut...) The coffee cake donut was a little underwhelming; I was expecting a bit more of a coffee punch. 

I know no one comes here for the coffee, but I was a bit bummed that they don't do espresso drinks at this spot - just drip."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-12-25,4.0,"I've heard a lot of praise for this place and they don't disappoint. On par with Dough and better than Underwest Donuts. Honestly, this place serves 5 star donuts! Docked 1 star off because service wasn't the friendliest. 

Brooklyn Blackout: super moist, cake doughnut. Crumbly top adds texture. When you bite into it, the inside is almost like eating wet cloud (?). Chocolate flavor was slightly bitter and not overly sweet.

Tres Leches: another great doughnut. Cakey, crumbly, moist and light. The condensed milk flavor comes through. 

Carrot cake: love the real carrot pieces and heavily spiced dough, but the glaze was too sweet.

Mocha: another favorite. Has the chocolate dough of Brooklyn blackout, but with a slight bitterness of coffee and added crunch.

Red velvet: do not get this. Tastes like beets. Although I appreciate them substituting beets with artificial red coloring, the flavor of beets was too strong.

1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2020-03-10,4.0,The donuts are delicious and the store is comfortable and cute. The price is too high for me though. Paying close to $10 for 2 donuts is outrageous! It great for a one time but I'll stick to other donut places.
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-11-12,4.0,"Pros: cute and tasty donuts in GC

Cons: obnoxious people in line and kinda pricy.

I would say it's worth trying once.  The turquoise baby blue donut with stars called out to me.  However, the line moves slowly and the people in line have no system of keeping a ""line"".  It shouldn't be that hard with the stand guidelines.  Get your donut and get the f*ck out."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-11-02,5.0,"I finally decided to give there donuts a try, and I have to say not bad. 
They remind me of old fashion donuts you get from your neighborhood diner shop. I really didn't know what flavors to get, but since I was buying for my girls I went with the sugar cinnamon and the triple chocolate. I was so intrigued by their carrot cake flavor but wasn't really sure about buying it, the guy who took my order, insisted that I try it and gave it to me for free. I'm so thankful that he did because I loved it. My girls was so happy, they wanted me to stop getting Dunkin Donuts and just buy from here. 
So when I'm in the grand terminal eating hall again, I'll be sure to get me some donuts from their planet... Lol"
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-12-28,3.0,"Good but not great! Still looking for that perfect doughnut. Tried this place out because everyone suggests it when you're in NYC but I was a bit disappointed. It was definitely on my foodie list but after trying it I think I'm going to continue the hunt for a good doughnut place. Any suggestions are welcome. 

Overall not bad. Iced Chai Latte was pretty good."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-11-27,4.0,"Was randomly searching for vegan donuts in the city and Doughnut Plant's new vegan flavors made with sourdough were the most intriguing.
So what did I do on that Friday night but pre-order two dark chocolate donuts to be picked up the following afternoon. A line formed after I left with pre-bagged donuts in hand, and they were already out of pistachio at 2pm on a Saturday.
The sourdough gives the donuts this airy mouth feel, but there's also a density that gives a good chew. I'm not a big apricot fan and that was the only other vegan flavor, so maybe next time.
The donuts went fantastically with some Van Leeuwan's ice cream. 
Would love to see them put out any vegan filled donuts!"
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-10-27,5.0,"Same great customer service. Tried new flavors!

Square Coconut Creme - AMAZING!! Filling is so fresh. Another eye-popping first bite, literally!! My sister thought the glaze made it too sweet though.

Square Peanut & Butter (seasonal) Jam - The blueberry jam was too sweet, seemed to have less peanut butter than usual 

Pumpkin with Spiced Pepitas (pumpkin seeds) - Pumpkin aftertaste with fantastic custard-like filling. Not too sweet 

Gluten Free Marcona Almond - I was hesitant to try it, but like the employee said, it tasted like the real deal. So delicious!!

Again, I need Doughnut Plant in LA!!"
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-10-30,3.0,"Man I wanted this to be awesome but it was just a-ok.

Why you'd plant here +'s:
+ Going through Grand Central you may need a sweet fix of some flavoring. They have styles that range from cake to creme filled. Flavors range from mocha to tres leches to coconut creme.

Why you'd not plant here -'s:
- Didn't find that the flavors really hit the spot.
- For $4 a doughnut I think I'll save the bucks for something else.
- TBH I've had better doughnuts.

Overall it's just ok. I don't think I'd go out of my way to get one and just save my $4 and the calories."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2020-02-08,4.0,"Got the carrot cake and tres leches donuts. Their cake donuts have the perfect texture--light yet still caKey, with the perfect bite. I ate them the day after they were made, and they still were delicious and tasted fresh. Personally thought the tres leches flavor wasn't special, just tasted like sweetness. The carrot cake also wasn't spiced that much. My mouth just registered: SWEET. Nevertheless, the texture of the donuts are great. I want to try their PBJ one next time"
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-10-03,4.0,"We ordered our doughnuts through DoorDash on a rainy evening in NYC. 
I ordered the Coconut Cream and it was good! But something very distinct that caught my attention the made my head tilt. 

Not on my favorite doughnut shop, but I would suggest for people to try. I do like how there are vegan, gluten free options!"
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2020-02-12,4.0,"This doughnut shop located on the lower food court level of Grand Central Terminal offers a variety of different and unique flavors and types of doughnuts.

I ordered a vanilla bean glazed yeast doughnut The doughnut was vey fluffy and airy, the glaze just the right amount of sweetness. It was hard to differentiate the vanilla bean flavor; it tasted pretty identical to a normal glazed doughnut at any other donut shop.

It was a pretty enjoyable doughnut but at a steep price point of $4.25, it's gotta be phenomenal to deserve a 5 star rating. Would definitely recommend trying this place at least once."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-07-09,5.0,"Square Doughnuts, what can't they not do ?

Well for one thing they can't tell me that Doughnut Plant has been open inside Grand Central Terminal for months and months now and I didn't even know until I saw a Yelp friend check in.

All this time I could have been chumping my face on their doughnuts.  Specially the Square Peanut Butter and Jelly doughnut.  How do they get the filling in all four sides ???? .

These doughnuts are not for the weight conscious, and if you eat a dozen you will end up looking like sumo wrestler.  So do what I do,  cut them in four pieces and share if you can. But don't pass up on them they have plenty of flavors and sizes to pick from , just try one."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2020-01-18,3.0,"Ok so I'm going to put this out there as a yeast doughnut enthusiast, Doughnut Plant has a great variety of flavors that are both creative and yummy ( with the exception of of the black sesame yeast doughnut , which is literally glaze and grounded sesame seeds on a bland doughnut) but they're yeast doughnuts suck. FIGHT ME.

There's something about how they prove or either mix the dough because the finish is very chewy and almost bread like. It's like biting into a baguette or cibatta without the hard exterior. If you like the gluten over developed in your doughnut, then Doughnut Plant might be the bees knees, but if you're looking for a pillowy, soft yeast doughnut, I'd stay clear.

Their cake doughnuts however are really good and on the money."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2020-01-16,5.0,"OMG! This will be added to one of my favorite doughnut shops! It absolutely is amazing. The lady behind the counter is very friendly. Service is excellent! I ordered the Brooklyn blackout, which a lot of yelpers are raving about. It sure is soft and moist inside, which I totally love. Mocha; I'm not a fan of.  Next one I'd like to try is the matcha green tea. Until my next visit....."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-08-10,3.0,"I love donuts in general. When I saw Doughnut Plant at the Grand Central Stadium, the presentation of what they had, I wanted to try.

While getting the hazelnut cream donut, I also wanted to get the watermelon agua fresca. 

I didn't get a chance to eat it until I was on the train to Coney Island. Taking a bite, I was a little disappointed. Donut was dry and not that flavorful. The watermelon agua fresca was not bad but not my fave either.

1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-12-08,3.0,Doughnut Plant is definitely in my top 10 donut shops in NYC. They always have so many selections (especially cream filled) which satisfies my sweet tooth. I gave this location 3 stars because the cashier who checked me out was sort of rude. He was on a phone call (had AirPods in) and barely acknowledged me? The donut was good at least...
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-12-26,3.0,Well it is a good donut shop with various choice. However you pay premium for simple and plain donut. It is still worth to try one if you never have one before.

My absolute faves are the peanut butter & banana cream and the wild blueberry cake. I've tried the brooklyn blackout, which I thought was just ok. The tres leches is also pretty good. The prices can be a little hefty but they're definitely worth it for the quality! 

Writing this review is making me crave donuts........"
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-03-30,3.0,"The original location is obviously better, but if you're in midtown and craving doughnut plant then this a good option.

The blueberry donut was pretty awesome.  The donut was dense and moist with tons of blueberry flavor. 

Pb&J donut was decent.  I was expecting the kids to love this one, but they didn't seem to enjoy it too much.  

I used to like their lemon poppy donut, but this time it felt overly greasy without much tartness."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-09-20,5.0,"Oh Doughnut Plant!  So amazing!!!  Both their yeast and cake doughnuts are wonderful, they have the perfect texture, flavor, and have not ever been greasy.  They are consistent in their delivery of delicious, well made doughnuts.  If you are in NYC and want a great doughnut, you need to get to your nearest Doughnut Plant location!"
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-02-15,5.0,"This is one of the best and worst things to happen to me - a Doughnut Plant right next to the track that I get off at from school. Whenever I'm grumpy about anything, I think of the coconut cream doughnut and immediately feel better while I savor that delayed gratification. And it's so great - even when there is a line, it's not too bad, so I get my doughnuts pretty quickly.

I say doughnuts plural because it is very hard to resist the beautiful display and get just one - I'm always very proud of myself when I do only get one (and even prouder when I will myself to walk past and get nothing). I've introduced multiple people to the coconut cream doughnut, which is a total dream, and have easily converted people to it. The soft, sweet, yeasty dough gives way to a decadent super coconutty cream that will blow your mind. Get it. Unless you hate coconut - I have other recommendations! 

The tres leches is a fantastic cake doughnut - totally different texture but complex with all the milks. The wild blueberry is addicting with the fresh blueberries bursting with flavor. The crème brûlée is ingenious with its crackly surface and creamy center. The rose doughflower is both beautiful and delicate, permeated with rose. The peanut butter banana and peanut butter blackberry are both awesome adult versions of our childhood favorite sandwiches. 

They even have a points system now - if this had existed when I first started, I would be rolling in doughnuts right now. I've definitely spent hundreds here LOL - yeah, at this location alone. :x Thanks Doughnut Plant for ruining my figure but giving me unparalleled joy and always making my day."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2020-02-19,4.0,"Wanted to try this place and went early Sunday morning. There was no line. I tried the coffee, red velvet, and creme brûlée. Each donut was about $4! The most expensive donut I have had. The coffee was really really good. I liked the filling that it came with. The creme brûlée was just ok. I wouldn't pay $4 for that one again. The red velvet was just ok too. I think over priced. Not worth the hype."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-10-16,2.0,Love donuts but was disappointed with this place. I thought the donuts tasted old and were not fresh. They were very very dry. I ordered the Nutella and creme brûlée and was honestly not a huge fan of both. Not sure if I'd be back.
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-01-12,3.0,"I was just so amazed the first time I tried Doughnut Plant in lower Manhattan, particulary with their cream bluree donuts.  3 years after the initial encounter, I found out they have another location at Grand Central which was closer to where I stayed this time.  I had to take a cab and get their donuts.  

The cream bluree....I don't know what happened to them but they were not that great this time.  The dough almost tasted stale and dry.  The same thing with Grand Central donut....very cute but dry.   It made me think they were old.  

I normally don't care for cake donuts but these ones were surprisingly moist.  My favorite was coffee cake and blueberry.  My husband liked them too.  

They are definitely expensuve.  $4 a donut....I bought 5 donuts totaling over $20 lol  The cake donuts were good but others failed and they were sure not $4 good."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-01-09,4.0,"Finally, a doughnut plant near(ish) me / work!  This output is located in the lower concourse of Grand Central, perfect for the much needed treat after a long day at the office. I don't think I've ever waited in a line longer than like 3 people, and service is prompt, friendly, and helpful when needing some inspiration/suggestions.  I've had a couple of the marzipan (seasonal/Chanukah) doughnuts, which were dainty for the price, but delightful.  

I happened to download the app after a ""Taste of Grand Central"" event, and over the holidays, they randomly gifted me $2 credit. Like I really needed a reason for more doughnuts after like a month of sufgoniyot. But, I guess I can have a resolution to continue to eat doughnuts? After finally trying the Peanut Butter and Blackberry Jam.  Omfg. As a peanut butter fan, this...this hits the spot. And it is yuuuuuge! 

I recall seeing a Peanut Butter and Banana Cream while I was there...finally, a resolution I can stick with!"
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-06-16,4.0,"I rarely go out of my way to buy doughnuts mainly because I'm not the biggest fan of the way they taste. However, my best friend loves dessert so I bought some for him because of the great reviews. I bought him the Creme brûlée and Brooklyn Blackout and tried a bite of each and omgggg they're so good!!! The creme brûlée had a nice crispy top but a soft and amazing custard on the inside. The contrast paired nicely together and it didn't taste overly sweet. On the other hand Brooklyn Blackout was a decadent chocolate cake doughnut. I wasn't expecting much when I first bit in to it but that doughnut is for anyone that loves chocolate cake. The doughnut was fudgey and dense with a little bit of chocolate filling  throughout it. The price is a lot more expensive than your typical doughnut from Dunkin, but Doughnut Plant is also sooo much better. I highly recommend if you ever pass by one."
1029,doughnut-plant-new-york-5,2019-11-03,3.0,"After countless encounters with this little shop whenever I cruised through Grand Central, I finally decided to give this Doughnut Plant doughnut place a try.

I first noticed it was quite expensive. A single doughnut that was fairly large but not ""huge"" could charge up to 10 dollars. I don't really get doughnuts a lot, but I don't think they are usually this expensive (unless they are). 

I decided to get the Wild Blueberry doughnut because I went there late at night and there were only a few doughnuts left. This doughnut store does have a large variety and even has vegan doughnuts. However, I do recommend coming earlier in the day if you want to have a bigger range of selection and types of doughnuts. 

The doughnut, in all honesty, was average for its price. I've had much better-tasting doughnuts, and these doughnuts also weren't fresh either. You could easily tell that the doughnuts had been sitting there for quite some time. Compared to other doughnut places, like Krispy Kreme, the Doughnut Plant was extremely underwhelming.

To be fair, I only did have one ""flavor"", so maybe if I had tried a different ""flavor"" or style the rating on this shop would be different. I'll keep you posted!"

The Grand Central location is a perfect spot for a treat during your commute. They offer their signature flavors as well as special mini doughnut named after GCT. They also offer coffee & they hot beverages. My favorite doughnut is the tres leche, it's moist and creamy just like the dessert, the Brooklyn blackout is also really good, not too rich.

I'm struggling and here is why .::: I got 3 donuts - Peanut Butter & Jelly, Coconut ( the one I came for!!) and the Valrhona Chocolate. The chocolate is what lost a star . The coconut and pb&j were outstanding. The chocolate didn't have a lot of flavor and didn't taste exactly fresh. So it was a disappointment.  However the coconut was delicious. The texture and filling were satisfying.  The pb&j was decadent. Both peanut butter and jam was homemade. So flavorful!  And it was HUGE.  Actually felt the pb&j and was worth the price tag.

1030,dinos-coffee-shop-new-york,2014-12-19,5.0,My fiancée and I just spent a few days in NYC in the time square area and I had spent some time here in yelp looking for a few places for breakfast/dinner since we weren't familiar with anything. We knew we would be spending quite a bit of money on good dinners and craft beers while we were there so we were hoping to find a reasonable place for breakfast that was tasty as well. Dino's may only have a few reviews but I figured we would check it out anyway since we would be in that area and I wanted to do some things that would make us feel like we were part of the NYC norm. We caught Dino as he was packing up for the day around quarter of 12(noon) and we were certainly bummed out but to our surprise he was beyond accommodating and fired up his grille to make us breakfast sandwiches with a smile!!! He chatted with us and not for a second seemed like he was put out by the fact that he was turning everything back on for us. His bagel egg/ham/ sausage sandwiches were wonderful and fresh and he had a variety of other breakfast pastry as well. To top it all off he gave us coffee * on the house* . Needless to say we went back this morning before we hopped on the train to come home and the food/service was just as great as the day before. Thank you Dino! See you next time we come to the city!

This one, in the shadow of a sculpture of a broken paper clip was semi busy, but still friendly and fast."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2019-10-12,1.0,"This Starbucks store is located at 90 Park Avenue, with so many Starbucks stores around New York (I'm sure they have the second-highest amount of stores in one city here, after Shanghai) there are so many different stores which you can choose from, after all there's one a few stores down either block / avenue from here - based on my experience I would say you'd be better off at one of them.

The store is a decent size, but there isn't much seating - there is only ONE table... I repeat ONE table of regular size, the rest seem to be really high, uncomfortable bar-style seating which are not appropriate for wheelchair users etc, with seats so close together you're basically squashed and forced to listen to everyone else's conversations with little space to even move.

The tables didn't seem especially clean and despite being in the store for a while I didn't see any staff members attempting to clean the few tablespaces they did have, relying on customers to do their job for them.

Only one staff member seemed friendly in the store - the rest seemed a little incompetent from taking my drink order wrong

- I was given a cocoa cloud macchiato rather than caramel
(Paying  $6.48 for a drink which is already expensive (Drinks can cost around $1.64 more than the UK in comparison) and being given the wrong drink isn't good enough especially when THEY MADE THE WRONG DRINK WRONG - the barista used too much foam to the point it was flowing down the cup and the drink was too foamy overall (and chocolaty) I normally love the foam made with egg-whites, but they seemed to fuck up a drink which I previously loved.

The selection of merch is a little small compared to other stores.

The seating doesn't work, issues with my drink and staff seeming incompetent (other than the staff member who sold me a premade iced tea in the evening who seemed pleasant and began talking to me about my stay in NY), the toilets also being really dirty was a big let-down. 

There are around 250 Starbucks locations in Manhatten alone, so if you want a Starbucks it is pretty easy to avoid this branch, and I think you should.

Walking into this location for the last 5+ years has been a daily pleasure. There is no other location I would give a rating like this especially when I'm not a fan of their coffee lol.
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2019-10-23,5.0,"I work in the 90 Park building so I order coffee on the app and pick it up from this location every morning. My order is always ready within 3-5 minutes of ordering on my phone and an employee named Christine remembers everyone's name. There are likely hundreds of people picking up mobile orders from this location every morning due to its central location in Midtown and Christine will see someone entering through the main door, say ""hello XX"" and hand them their order. It's incredible. For example, this morning, I barely made it through the door before I heard her say ""good morning Peter"" and hand me my coffee. Best customer experience I have ever witnessed and I'm lucky that I get to witness it every day."

When I place a mobile order, the option to order a Frappuccino is still there but when I arrive to pick it up, I'm told the blender is broken. I'm offered a refund but no other courtesy for the inconvenience and hardly even an apology. That isn't the only issue. Other times I place a mobile order for one of their iced teas and same thing. I get there and am told ""we ran out of tea. Would you like a refund?"".  I'm done frequenting this location. It used to be reliable but for the past few months it's been a disappointment more often than not. If you run out of something or cannot fulfill an order, there should be a way to indicate as such on the app so people like me who are rushing to catch a train aren't wasting their time waiting for refunds for orders that cannot be completed."

1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2018-09-04,5.0,"I love this spot. I mean it might take a while to get your drink, like all Starbucks, because it's such a popular place, but the staff are super nice and I think they should get recognized for that. They are very attentive, friendly, and keep that place very, very clean. Kudos to the staff! :)"
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2016-06-05,3.0,"I came here to get some work done remotely on a Friday morning while my sister worked at a hotel nearby.

I'm not a fan of the one homeless man who continuously walks in and out with his big tattered suitcase. He sits in a corner and counts his money, buys a single coffee, walks outside and tosses it in the street... And repeat. He kept eying people and speaking incomprehensibly to himself, except for his occasional rude blasphemes. 

Other than that, the people watching here is quite interesting. I was here almost 4 hours and the different backgrounds and reasons people were here was insane. From the two African men working on Salesforce consulting to the crying woman in the corner... The distractions for me were infinite. 

I did however enjoy the self service condiment bar, where you can find every milk and cream you can think of. Half and half, skim and whole milk, soy milk, coconut milk... I guess they're just missing almond milk. Usually these milk options cost extra, so it was great that these were provided. 

Ok, but really, it isn't ok for this Starbucks to not have a bathroom. You can't feed me these natural laxatives and diuretics (coffee and tea) and not expect me to need to use the toilet. 

Otherwise, this is your standard office building Starbucks, with limited seating (thanks to the homeless man talking up the only real table/cushioned seating in the store) and people coming in and out for coffee."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2017-01-11,3.0,Typical NYC Starbucks....small. Great location if you are near Grand Central Station. Stand at the window counter and do some people watching.
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2015-02-27,1.0,"Very crowded around lunch hours...long line and staffs are slow to take/serve.
Also TERRIBLE customer service,probably one of the worst that I experienced at every Starbucks location.
The only reason I use this location is it is located close to GCS and have relatively lots of seating."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2015-03-26,4.0,"To me, One starbucks is the same as any starbucks (Unless you're in London, they got some really cool starbucks). The drinks are roughly the same, the food the same blah blah blah. The point is, you go to a starbucks more than once if A) its the only one around and we live in NYC so yeah, not the case or B) It has a good staff that makes your drink the way you want it. For me, that would be Danny or JImmy! These guys are awesome. The staff in general is pretty cool but I've been going here for a very long time and these two are awesome. I only see them on the morning shift mon-fri around 10am, and while the line may be long (theres like a LOT of people so yeah its gonna be long) they make sure my drink is right every single time just how I want it!

So if you're in a super hurry probably keep looking for a regular coffee place or less crowded starbucks (good look morning commuters) or wait a bit and get the drink done right here."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2017-04-13,3.0,"Pretty standard New York Starbucks. Staff was pleasant enough but they did run out of most breakfast sandwiches at 10AM the day I visited. Perhaps that was a fluke. Otherwise, what you would expect."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2015-04-14,3.0,This is a pretty standard Starbucks but they always seemed to have enough food in stock and the employees are super friendly.
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2017-02-12,4.0,"The location is pretty good about getting orders correct but the only downside is when there's a big line, they tend to get discombobulated to where you're waiting 10 min for a simple drink."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2017-03-21,3.0,"this  starbucks on park ave between 39thst and 40th is usually crowded during the morning rush but this afternoon not so much .it's not that spacious inside but a few tables inside and wall to wall window counter stool seating is available and if you are lucky you might find a spot . the selection is typical buckys with hot and cold bevs, pastries , sandwiches , salads , etc, free wifi . the place attracts the office building types and folks coming and going to grand central terminal .the bench outside is usually occupied by folks who are not customers but the workers behind the counter are too busy with paying customers to deal with it. overall i never had an issue with my cappuccino which i usually enjoy along with some random pastry so i give this starbucks 3.5 stars ."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2014-08-31,4.0,I enjoy going to this Starbucks as it's got a great amount of space and the staff is friendly. Every time I've gone there they've gotten my order right even though their system is a bit different.  So if you place your order and want a hot sandwich you'll have to get your coffee first then walk towards the front of the store near the oven to get your food.  This doesn't seem complicated at first but when you're trying to figure out whether or not your name for your coffee will be yelled first or your food it gets to be annoying trying to tell one person to back up off your coffee and then going to the other area to get your food.  Just an annoyance but not worth losing a star.  ENjoy my times here
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2016-05-02,4.0,"I live nearby and come here quite often - during weekends, on my way to work in the morning, whenever. They're always friendly and efficient. Out of the countless times I've been there, there was one instance where they had taken my order without realizing the item was no longer available. Multiple people behind the counter apologized to me and quickly fixed the problem by letting me order something else."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2013-03-19,4.0,"Staff at this starbucks is great, especially Danny and Jimmy.  Line can move slowly sometimes though, and why does Starbucks not have better pastries?"
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2015-12-13,2.0,Adequate seating and service but NO BATHROOM. Starbucks a block away on 40th and Lex has more seating and a bathroom.
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2013-11-13,4.0,"One of the better Starbucks I've been to (and I've been to a lot).  Decent seating (considering it's New York), and most of the baristas are seriously top-notch.  

Sometimes they'll close the bathroom early (if you go in up to 90 minutes before close, you may be out of luck).  

Overall, I'd certainly recommend this Starbucks and will be back myself."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2013-10-23,3.0,"I was early for an interview so I grabbed a coffee and a pastry--this was at 11:30am. Fast service but nowhere to sit. Wahhh.
Ate that croissant like a hobo on the street."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2013-05-11,3.0,"The lines here are very long, especially at peak times, and they messed my order up a couple of times.  But the baristas are very friendly (especially for NY) and they do their best to move the line along quickly."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2013-02-23,3.0,This Starbucks is crowded but the line seems to move quickly.  Less touristy more business.  Used to work in this building so I often meet friends for coffee here.  Staff is pleasant too.
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2011-12-23,3.0,"My office used to be a block from here;  then we moved away.  Now we're back (ugh).  ANYWAY, there is a Brazilian (I think he's Brazilian, anyway) barista here who remembered me *and* my drink after I hadn't been here in a year and a half.  CRAZY.

The staff is really nice, but there's just something about this location that doesn't do it for me.  Luckily, in a world with a proliferation of Starbucks, all I need to do is walk two blocks to 41st and Madison for the next one."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2011-10-30,2.0,"Why am i reviewing a starbucks?  well because i checked in here.. OK so i don't normally drink coffee but i had some time to kill so seemed appropriate.  
I ordered a small black coffee and waited more then 10 min for them to hand it to me... well at least they apologized... but i mean really things like this should take no more then a min... the coffee was already made and sitting in the machine.  
Maybe this is a common thing.. to wait for you coffee at a Starbucks but its not like it was packed with ppl.... there was 2 ppl waiting on drinks and one person in the line..."

Please go to the one on Madison and 41st, this one takes way too long. I save time by walking the extra one block/one avenue rather then waiting there for my drink...."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2013-05-30,4.0,Fast. Nice new lower counter to pick up your drink.
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2014-05-11,1.0,Horrible customer service and completely inefficient for the ridiculous amount of people working behind the counter.
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2008-01-31,4.0,"This Starbucks is one at which I could potentially sit and relax.  There seemed to be several outlets, a few tables, and a bench.  The cafe was clean, and the service was fast and friendly.  They did not have my turkey-bacon breakfast sandwich, but I decided that was alright.  The odd thing about this store is that their lids are small and not your traditional Starbucks lid.  On the bright side, the lid did come in useful on my walk to the MNR as it was one you had to open the perforated portion to actually drink your coffee.

*WiFi hotspot (TMobile)
*iTunes WiFi Music Store
*Oven-warmed food"
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2012-05-02,3.0,Really the only coffee in the area unless you want it from a roach coach!
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2008-05-15,4.0,"This is a terrific Starbucks.  They always make terrific cappuccinos.  While it is a small location, they do have a few tables that offer a great place to relax.  However, the tables are often taken, but there is a bench on the block outside if you are just looking to veg out."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2010-02-11,5.0,"My favorite Starbucks location! Perhaps, it's because it's in my office building... hahah.

The staff are super friendly and always remember what I like.  Unfortunately, the Starbucks around my house always gets my order wrong. :(

The White Mocha's here totally kick ass- delicious.

I enjoy coming every morning and afternoon to get coffee at this location!"
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2014-12-05,1.0,"Yuk...I just moved my office to across the street from this location and I'm not impressed AT ALL.  I feel the CS is rude here, the line is slow, it's always ridiculously crowded, and just in general, a poor experience.  The people here need to take a training course from the location on 36th and Madison....they are so friendly in that location.  I purchased a $20 cup from them and they didn't even have a bag for me to put it in!  No sorry either just handed me the box and said we are out of bags.  I almost told them to take the cup back but I really wanted it.  Awful employees here."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2014-06-20,1.0,"The customer service is lacking at this location. The past two times I have been there my drink, which was called off correctly, was taken by someone else before I could stop them. When I told the baristas, both times they asked me to take the drink the other person ordered, which was similar, but not what I ordered. When I asked them to make me the drink I actually ordered, they gave me such a hard time that I ended up taking the other person's drink, and then throwing it the trash as soon as I walked outside. Such a waste of money. If you want to drink what someone else ordered, this is probably the place for you."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2011-12-30,3.0,"This has to be one of the slowest Starbucks I've ever been to. If you are in a rush, do not go to this location. At peak hours the employees forget people's drinks, and often have to ask customers to repeat their order. Only reason I go to this Starbucks is because it is very close to my office. Also, every so often I get an extra additional shot on my usual espresso order to make up for the wait. They aren't horrible, but they aren't exceptional either."
1031,starbucks-new-york-241,2011-02-17,4.0,Right by my job. I typically get a toasted buttered bagel with a tall pike and a shot of toffee nut. I'm a gold member so the .50 cent shot gets taken off my bill. The baristas are typically very fast and friendly.
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2017-12-04,4.0,"I'd like to salute this Pret location. 

I didn't think I would ever do that because I first fell in love with Pret while studying abroad in London in '09 and the sandwiches there + the Pellegrino saved my life (I couldn't handle the taste of European water at the time!).

Well I stopped by one day at this location and the product is the same, but shout out to the staff here. 

Super helpful with adopting the digital app world of Pret and receiving a free cup of Joe + some samples to shoot. Super kind and memorable so next to my Pret I stopped by every day before class back in another decade, this spot put a smile on my face so thank you!"
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2019-11-02,5.0,"This was my first time there and I loved the food! I had the mixed green with spinach salad, sweet potato, chicken, candy pecans, raw beets or purple carrots and a soft cheese. The cheese was perfect for me to dip my roll with. The natural juices are also very delicious. I had the watermelon beet juice. a little pricey for me but it is all natural so I feel it is worth it for my health. I look forward to going back again and trying other Food.  Also the place was clean, well stocked and very comfortable"
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2019-02-08,1.0,"I posted this in the wrong Pret A Manger (350 Park Avenue) back on 01.25.19. It should be posted here instead (400 Park Avenue)...  

I'm not a fan of this location.  I am rarely acknowledged, let alone greeted, never a thank you or anything.  Meanwhile the customers around me are.  I decided to stick around and see just how this works.  I had a Hispanic male cashier back on the morning of 01.25.19 around 09:30 - 10:00.  He asked me twice if I wanted my baguette warmed. I said no twice.  Finished with me, and shoved my change in my hand rudely.  Female customer behind me... He waited and then made a point to say hello to her.  Interesting... I guess only certain customers are worthy of being greeted.  I'll go to the Pret on Lexington instead where I receive much better service.  All of your customers should be greeted and treated with the same level of respect, whether they are a male or a female.  I can guess why the female customer was greeted so warmly... Too busy macking..."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2018-07-23,4.0,"Nice location.  Came here to wait for a friend who works upstairs.  Nice banquette seating.  Know that in this particular area,  there's a Pret on every corner so I'm used to my fair share of them. No pike because it was the afternoon in midtown so there's little foot traffic.  Bought an overpriced strawberry lemonade which was tasty and a couple of croissants.  Lots of seating and it's an entire corner.  Lots of space to sit and work but really not seeing any outlets around for plugging in.  Only giving 4 stars because I told the cashier little ice in my lemonade and with little to no traffic, including no one behind me, she still gave a lot of ice."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2019-07-26,1.0,Very bad experience I came in for a coffee and water. The place looks great but when I used the restroom it was filthy and I got a very bad bad disgusting smell. I understand restrooms get dirty but when I told the 3 staff members about the disgusting bathroom they didn't care. I got the dirty looks from all 3 employees for even mentioning it. They had maybe 2 other customers and simply didn't give a s**t about the s**t. They were just standing around doing nothing. Terrible experience
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2016-04-13,4.0,"Pret used to be my go-to spot for a quick, affordable lunch back in London, so I was really happy to see it followed me to New York. Granted, the prices are not crazy cheap (here or in the UK), but neither are the other options you have in Midtown. 

Food-wise, selections are pretty simple but tasty. You can taste the difference in their fresh, higher-quality ingredients. I've always liked that they keep items in-store only for the day that they're made (and donate what's left to charity at the end of the day). Their sandwich selections, which come on soft 9-grain bread or harder baguettes, come in a variety that ranges from egg salad to more interesting options like balsamic chicken & avocado. You'll find that simplicity is key here. None of the options are going to shock you with their creativity, but the few ingredients they use are high quality and chosen well. I love their prosciutto sandwich, for example, which only has prosciutto, sharp parmesan, tomato, and basil on a baguette but still manages to hit the spot.

I find the sandwiches decently filling for a standard lunch, and sometimes I like to pick up a half-sandwich (for half the price aka ~$3-4) and a latte to fill me up. They're not going to leave you feeling stuffed, but I feel like they're what a good portion (read: not supersized) should be. 

Pret also offers a selection of salads, wraps, soups, fresh baked goods, and snacks like granola-yogurt pots. Everything comes well-portioned and is convenient to grab and go for all of us Midtown office workers.

Coffee-wise, I think their prices skew towards the cheaper side in the city. A latte is only $3, which is better than I've found at my neighborhood coffee shop, and it's decently strong to boot.

Overall, I'm very happy with Pret in general and with this particular location. Employees are friendly and helpful (in a city that makes this a rarity), food is above-average, and the price is right."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2016-01-08,5.0,"By far my favorite Pret in the city! Friendly staff, clean dining space, beautiful decor, and of course, delicious fresh food. 

Their chicken mozzarella baguette is my favorite. I like their tomato feta soup and falafel hot wrap too. If I'm feeling like a portable healthy snack, a protein pot is a quick and filling snack."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2016-01-10,4.0,"Pret, you and I are about to become very good friends. Maybe even best friends.

I've always been a frequent visitor of your various locations. Basically, you can expect me to pop in for a grab and go lunch on a semi bi-weekly basis.

Your soups (especially Moroccan Lentil) and your sandwiches (Ham and cheese, tuna and cucumber, brie and tomato) are constantly in my lunch rotation. I'm only lukewarm about your salads, but don't take that personally. I'm not a salad person to begin with.

Now that you've opened around the corner from my office, you now get the distinct honor of being the closest place to get food (excluding the office cafeteria, of course). So based solely on that, you'll probably be seeing more of me.

And now that you're featuring the Jamon Beurre sandwich, which might be the best sandwich I've ever had from Pret, you'll DEFINITELY be seeing more of me (Fair warning: I'd keep those well stocked if I were you).

PS - This review is actually for the location on 400 Park Ave South and 28th St, but it seems to be lacking a listing and Yelp seems to be mistaking this for the other 400 Park Ave location at 53rd st, so yeah."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2018-03-16,4.0,"Thumbs up for this place.  Clean environment healthy ingredients, fresh squeezed juice, good selection of simple salads with both paleo and veggie friendly stuff.  Tried many salads sandwiches and juices.  They are all high quality and fresh.  Service is quick and friendly also. Prices are also reasonable for manhattan.  

Eating there is ok for a quick bite but be aware that they only have 7 stools on shared bars. They could turn up the temps on the fridge just 2 or 3 degrees as some ingredients were  almost ice cold.  Otherwise I loved everything I ate."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2017-10-29,4.0,"I eat at various Pret locations all the time when in Manhattan, and this location lives up to my expectations. I guess there's not much more to say than that. It's location is an easy walk from the Lexington Ave / 59th St subway stop, and that fits in nicely with my subway usage patterns when I'm in the city on business."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2016-12-20,5.0,"I got some broccoli cheese soup and a ham and cheese sandwich when I was here. It's not pricy at all compared to other places in NYC and tastes so good. Their sandwiches are made with real crunchy baguette which is especially pleasing for Europeans who are fed up with American breads. Their soups are so tasty, and hot although they came from warm shelves only.
There's barely any seating (around 10 high chairs) but one can look directly on the street."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2013-06-25,3.0,"A solid lunch/snack option in this neck of the woods. 

I'm here almost everyday for something. A cold sparkling water? Check. A quick coffee? Check. One of their hot wraps? Check. A fruit or arugula/tabouleh bowl? Check. 

No complaints really from me - everything is well stocked, the cashiers are speed demons and although the line situation can be confusing (some days it's one line, other days seperate lines form) Pret always has a good selection of healthy options for snacking and lunch at pretty reasonable prices."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2015-03-25,4.0,"I go here all the  time when I am running around and looking for lunch in between jobs.

really all the food is delicious. the soups are first class. I even like their cookies. everything is fresh and fast. I am always looking for a pret!

just beware the cofee is really awful. do not get coffee here"
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2017-05-10,5.0,This is a great option for fresh food. But most importantly for me is the service level here. It's been consistently good and friendly but today made it a bit more special. At checkout I made a comment that the Handmade Brownie Bite looked great but I'll have to skip it to be healthy. At which point after paying she slid one my way and said - treat yourself!!! Love.... will likely give away the brownie since her gesture was surely my treat for the day. Thanks!
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2016-11-20,3.0,Decent lunch place to grab a quick bite (they are very efficient). Food is good and fresh (particularly the cookies). Only con which is important is price. It's significantly overprice (~50-100% extra for the same quantity)
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2016-07-29,5.0,Free iced coffee before 12 pm today at pret a manger. Cesar hooked us up and made them iced lattes! Thank you!!
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2014-08-20,4.0,"I go there pretty often. It is good. Not the best, but very fine to get a quick lunch. They are very efficient, so even if there is a big queue, you'll be out in just a few minutes.

They have some good stuff: their chocolate chip cookie is very good (most of the time, when they don't cook it too much), so are their sandwiches.

In summary: perfect for a quick lunch. To enjoy a real meal, go for another place !"
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2017-03-30,5.0,I love this location and am a huge fan of their new vegan lunch box thing. It's absolutely delicious and very healthy. The staff are simply wonderful. Always happy and they are eco-conscious as well. Love going in here. Thanks.
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2015-05-29,4.0,"I cannot complain, this is my go-to when I dont bring my own lunch. Always fresh  and I can always see the nutrional content for everything. Only a few spots to sit, but this place is more grab and go. The prices so far have been low for the area. Hope that doesnt change. Pleasant staff, too."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2017-06-22,5.0,Conveniently located for today's lunch. Love how fresh my egg salad and arugula sandwich was. They offered to steam my half and half for my tea which was actually great! I met Elaine and was treated to her enthusiasm. She presented me with a free out of the oven chocolate chip cookie brought right to my table. Love this new location.
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2015-09-02,4.0,Really quick but super tiny- don't plan on sitting there unless you want to stalk someone!
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2016-12-16,5.0,"This is a review for the Pret a Manger on Park/28th.  They make awesome lattes, and the treats and salads look excellent. I'll be back!"
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2013-02-27,4.0,"I used to hate pret, thinking the sandwiches were too small for a normal person. I maintain that belief for most, but their baguettes are definitely meal-worthy. (The heated sandwiches and the normal ones I still think you need to buy an extra half or bag of chips with). I am a big fan of their 'famous' ham and cheese baguette, but they also recently introduced a new pesto chicken one that is worthwhile. The chicken noodle soup is a good side for cold days - or just those days you are feeling extra hungry.

Tip 1: Stale Bread.
They claim to make their sandwiches fresh every day. While that may be true, I am convinced that some of the bread is leftover as some sandwiches are MUCH TOUGHER than others. I would suggest squeezing the baguette before purchase, because while one may be fresh and taste great, the one next to it may have stale bread. Sometimes they only have stale bread, so I'd suggest getting a soup to dip it in.

Tip 2: The Line.
They have separate lines! Sometimes you enter and despite 7 cash registers there is only one incredibly long line that funnels into the registers. I reccommend being the one to start the new lines ebcause they announce every 5 minutes or so that the lines are separate, causing some madness as people jockey to the newly formed queues.

Overall, pretty reasonably prices for reasonably good food with a good selection. It's pretty quick too."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2012-10-02,4.0,"Great place to pick up a quick sandwich.

They are kinda on the small side, but then again, its probably a normal size sandwich (Fat American) 

The Juices are killer !

Major plus that they get you in-and-out fast ! (NewYorker on Speed)"
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2014-11-01,4.0,"This is a perfect stop for a quick lunch or breakfast.  They carry a variety of sandwiches, wraps, salads, fruit, snacks, breakfast items, etc. that are fresh and not aren't overly expensive.  The lines can get long during lunchtime, but they move quickly and I'm always out of there in a few minutes."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2014-12-19,4.0,Organic Coffee and alot of other organic things great price and i like that they have Half sandwiches so when your not that hungry works out great
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2013-02-28,3.0,Pret is always fresh and pricey.  The egg salad with sun dried tomato on a crusty bread was tasty but smallish for $3 I could get a lot more breakfast elsewhere.  Service is friendly and quick.  Never have to worry about freshness since they donate unsold food every night.
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2014-10-03,3.0,Soup and sandwich place. Seating is limited but most customers are take out. Check out is fairly quick and the food is not bad. Healthy but nothing really jumped out at me.
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2011-09-07,4.0,"If you want simple sandwiches with the freshest ingredients, this is a place you should try.  The sandwiches are offered on wheat, rolls, and wraps.  The wheat is so soft, that it should be considered a delicate sandwich.

The soups are phenomenal also.  Tomato basil is definitely a winner.

From time to time, I have a craving for the carrot cake slice!  It is really good --light and soft from cake to icing; good without being overly sweet.  Great with a cup of darjeeing."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2011-06-01,4.0,"As much as I HATE paying their ridiculously high prices for a salad (minus 1 star for you for an $8-9 salad!), I still do it. Often. More often than I care to admit. 

Their sandwiches are yummy, too. And I really like that they donate all their leftovers every day to some local food bank. 

Plus, all their employees are insanely friendly, helpful and seem thrilled to be working there. I want whatever they're having."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2009-11-16,3.0,"HOLY CRAP!  I just had a Pret sandwich with WAY too much horseradish in the mustard!  My sinuses are completely open - thank you very much.  Not cool at all... not cool at all.

Other than for today's painful experience, Pret does not disappoint - better than average sandwiches and salads.  And it's relatively quick even during the lunch rush.  

Now only if I would have thought to do what this guy did...

1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2007-06-26,4.0,"Anyone with a day job in midtown has most likely been to Pret, or at the very least, seen a location.  There are around a dozen or so in midtown.  I can't speak for them all, but I assume they are all practically the same.

This location is great.  First, all their sandwiches and salads are made everyday in their kitchen, using very fresh ingredients.  I recommend the organic chicken and mozzarella, or the thai chicken wrap.  Plus all of their sandwiches come in 6 and 12 inch sizes.  Second, they are reasonably priced for sandwiches, and just as good as that overcrowded, expensive, very slow place across the street (yes I am referring to Dishes...) Third, they have 10 or so variates of an excellent brand of chips in my opinion: Kettle chips.

Finally, they have 7 or 8 registers, and all are in use during the lunch rush, so you are in and out within a couple minutes.  There are a couple tables, but it is really a takeout place.  It doesn't matter, as there are numerous places to eat outside within a block or two."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2010-09-24,4.0,"I got some iced coffee there this morning and it was very good (made even better by their organic soy milk).  The aroma as soon as I walked in the door was *wonderful* and I wanted to buy everything in sight, but somehow I got control of myself; ha ha.  Also, the manager was a really nice guy; extremely pleasant."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2015-09-19,1.0,They're blasting hip-hop music and it's making everyone here uncomfortable. Obviously today (Sept. 19th) is the manger's day off. Very disappointed with the level of class here.
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2013-03-26,4.0,"The staff here is great.  I come here for people at work and we get the ""warm"" delicious chocolate chip cookies.  They are AMAZING.  Definitely recommend them!  Who knew."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2011-06-05,3.0,"Pret basically is a staple for the 9 - 5 office worker in Manhattan, everyone I work with grabs a sandwich from there at least once a week. The very first time I ate at a Pret was in London, this was years ago, and well before they started opening up in Manhattan. I was so excited when I started seeing these mod sandwich shops popping up all over the city. The food always seems carefully designed, and is always beautifully presented, the cashiers are fast and friendly--you can probably get in and out of a Pret within 5 minutes, which is so important on a lunch break.

My favorite sandwich of all was the tomato, brie and basil; it came on a long cylindrical baguette, and was both soft and crunchy, and tasty and filling. It seems like they've stopped carrying it though because the last few times I've been there they haven't had it. So, I've switched to the grilled mozzarella Caprice sandwich that they heat up for you. It's tasty, but it's not nearly the same, and as a result I go there a lot let."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2009-09-15,4.0,"Healthy, fresh, great selection, expensive though. Love the sushi, it always tastes fresh. Love all of the salads especially the one with mozzarella and avocados. Love the chicken/pesto sandwich- it is amazing! Soups are also generally really good, people who work here are always super nice and helpful. 

I only wish it were slightly cheaper. But everything else about Pret is delicious!"
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2012-04-02,3.0,"Great sandwiches and I appreciate the fact they warm them. Now I have to say my favorite is their granola oat fruit slice. Awesome granola bar, but the calories are a killer. Glad they now have it in a smaller bar. Maybe after my training I can indulge again."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2012-03-04,3.0,"Very overpriced, but not excessively price gouge-y for a pre-made sandwich/salad chain.  Convenient for an easy quick lunch on a busy work day when you look up and it's 3 PM and you're starving and are so weak from hunger you can't think about what it is your stomach wants.

I like the roast beef and tuna sandwiches (although the tuna is very salty).  The ham and egg sandwich is also very tasty - they use Niman Ranch smoked ham, which is great quality ham.  Avoid the specialty turkey Thanksgiving sandwich that shows up around the namesake holiday - there is something in there that tastes highly chemical, possibly the cranberry sauce.  

Also, avoid the chai latte.  Very weak chai flavor and had a weird slightly bitter aftertaste."
1032,pret-a-manger-new-york-4,2012-08-23,2.0,"I usually get the Vietnamese sandwich which is delicious.  I wanted to try something different today so I went with the Buffalo Chicken wrap.  Ugh.  This was terrible.  I opened the wrapper to find basically the entire sandwich stuck to the paper.  I had to pick and peel away at it to get the tortilla off of the paper and then closely inspect it to make sure I wouldn't be eating any residual paper.  First bite...ugh again.  Marinara in a buffalo chicken wrap???  Ok, my fault because I did read the description before buying it and thought, yeah I guess that could work.  IT DOESN'T.  The combo of blue cheese and marinara is not natural.  
Minus another point because this location has the most ghetto workers ever.  Every time I go in they're all cackling away amongst themselves talking about how much they want to go home.  They never look up, say hi, how are you, etc...like they're actually on the clock!  Today I brought my sandwich up...the manager was standing next to the line of cashiers yelling, ""ok...who wants to go home, who got here early?!?!"".  What?!  This is not the back room of Walmart...save that shit for the breakroom...not in front of customers.  Anyway, I'll still go here for the Viet. because it's the closest location to my office but I'll be wary of trying anything new."

I loved the style of the building (not surprising) but the coffee was great, seating was surprisingly plentiful, and staff were extremely nice. It was like a white and green version of a  70's diner/ ice cream parlor."
1033,ralphs-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-07,5.0,"Probably one of my favorite cafes in a city that has one on every corner! After a full day of walking and taking in the spring season, my friend and I spotted this coffee extension of Ralph Lauren. I was intrigued and in need of a short rest, so we stopped in. 

The cafe is BEAUTIFUL, bringing in the vibe and design of Ralph stores, and there were a good amount of tables and seating. The white and green accents combined with the beautiful lighting made for a perfect scene. 

We both ordered cappuccinos which were absolutely delicious. They came out at the perfect temperature and we made our way to a table to continue our conversation. I definitely was not expecting to come across such a gem of a place, and I can definitely see myself frequenting this place! Will definitely be back to try the pastry options!"
1033,ralphs-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-29,5.0,"This place is a true gem. What an elegant coffee shop! Much smaller than I expected, but such food quality and nestled right in the store. I had thought this would be a separate floor all together, but it's right within the store. The decor is absolutely fabulous. It features emerald green and white tones. Not too many people know about it so it's a nice environment to catch up with friends. 

Lovely experience!"
1033,ralphs-coffee-new-york-4,2019-12-05,5.0,"I came on a weekday morning and there were plenty of available tables. 

My seasonal maple latte ($5) was delicious and the scone (OMG the scone!) came with a small jar of jam and a personal pat of french butter. 

For a little under $12, I had a quiet and beautiful space to relax and enjoy my breakfast. The baristas and other employees were so kind, informative, and personable. I felt welcome!  I think I'll be finding myself crossing the park for this spot again and again! 

Merci, Ralph's!"
1033,ralphs-coffee-new-york-4,2019-05-13,5.0,This place is so dope. You can pay $5 to get a coffee and seat inside an luxurious Ralph Lauren Shop. The coffee is a little bitter with Java but I love it! Good place to seat and relax.
1033,ralphs-coffee-new-york-4,2019-10-19,5.0,"This is a stunningly gorgeous coffee shop in the Ralph Lauren store in Manhattan that is owned by Ralph Lauren.  It is located off to the right of the Ralph Lauren Flagship store.  They feature a limited menu with your choice of a muffin, a few cookie options, two different kinds of sandwiches (either vegetarian or a turkey sandwich), and a few pastry items as well.  Coffee and tea drinks are also spotlighted.  The coffee shop is decorated with gorgeous round tables with vases of white roses, crystal chandeliers on the ceiling and a large mirror surrounded with a gold intricate frame.  I recommend getting the red currant scone that is served with butter and strawberry jam and the oatmeal raisin cookie too; both are soft baked and scrumptious; yum!  Prices are also extremely affordable too that won't break your wallet.  This is perfect stop to grab something to eat and rest after a long day of shopping."

1033,ralphs-coffee-new-york-4,2019-11-11,5.0,Hands down one of the best coffee shop I've been to. Out of all the places I've traveled to this coffee shop beats them all. Aside from it being inside the Ralph Lauren store and you will see random models walking by as you sip on your coffee it definitely  gives a nice elegance touch.. their coffee isn't too overpriced. This is my favorite Ralph's coffee location as it is right next to Central Park. Grab coffee to go and walk toward the park
1033,ralphs-coffee-new-york-4,2019-10-09,4.0,"Who know there was this fancy shmancy cafe inside Ralph Lauren? I found myself on the Upper East Side on a sunday afternoon, and found this place here on yelp. While the place looked super cute, it was packed. I found myself a spot at the communal table, and sipped my expensive cappuccino. They have a designated cafe spot, but there are also some tables within the shop that you can sit and eat at."
1033,ralphs-coffee-new-york-4,2019-08-21,5.0,"This place is gorgeous, and very close to Central Park soon as you walk in your vision is flooded with dark green, white and black decor. There is plenty of seating and despite the area being completely full, it was so peaceful and quiet because the guests are respectful of others around them. Their coffee is really great, as is the lighting, and it looks as though this is a pleasant place to stay for a couple of hours to get some work done.  I love stopping by for a coffee before I take a walk in the park."

At first when I walked up to find that it was a coffee shop attached to a Ralph Lauren (duh, Ralph's!!), I had to ask myself... how much am I willing to spend on a cup of coffee? I decided on $15 and was beyond surprised that I ordered a cappuccino and a chocolate croissant for only $9! My coffee was delicious and the croissant was perfect. 

The cafe itself is pretty small, but nicely decorated and the staff was amazing! Don't pass by this shop while you're in NYC."
1033,ralphs-coffee-new-york-4,2019-08-21,4.0,"Beautiful cafe but prepare your wallets!!

On my way to Met Breur, I was hunting for a quick coffee stop and saw this on my ""To-Trys"".  I had heard of this coffeshop and marvelled at how gorgeous it was!  It's in the lobby of the Ralph Lauren's store, but the cafe section is massive!  You are first greeted by gorgeous marbled floorspace, a huge community table, and two sectioned-off areas with complete couches/lounge areas.  A great hangout or date space!

I got an iced latte to stay, since now I obviously wanted to spend some more time at this place.  It was around $6...the most expensive coffee I had.  But, they had good espresso and served it in a fancy wine glass.  Decided to stay a little bit longer than just a simple ""to-go"" coffee.  I would definitely swing by here on an afternoon to read or catch up on some light work, but not something to regular at!"

I enjoyed the rich flavor and smooth texture of the coffee drink and the warm, welcoming service from the helpful staff.  Was it expensive? That depends on how you look at it: it may be--but at least I found something at Ralph Lauren that I could afford!"
1033,ralphs-coffee-new-york-4,2019-09-15,3.0,"We went there on Saturday and it was very crowded. Coffees were great but I don't think there is any service... It's more like a tourist spot rather than a regular coffee shop. I went there because I like Ralph Lauren very much. If you are looking for great coffee only, I think there are some more other options around."

You order at the counter, get a number to place on your table and they'll bring it to you. Very basic cafe goods. Coffee is your basic latte, espresso, americano, etc and they have a limited Harney and Sons tea selection. No tea lattes. What a shame. Service is speedy though and the waiters have sharp eyes to take away your empty coffee cup or they ask if you need more hot water for your tea."

I was very pleased to see the Ralph's Coffee was opened and now I can grab some coffee on a way to the park. The place is beautifully decorated , with nice flower arrangements, everything is perfect as always with Ralph Lauren, but what is wrong with the service??!!! Absolutely rude and unacceptable behavior , never "" hello or good bye "", big favor face , + 15-20 ' to make a coffee to go on a off peak hours is just unacceptable. I asked nicely how long is going to take more and the answer was "" do you think you are the only one who orders coffee "". It's  sad when people like that carry the reputation of the great brand and can easily ruin it. The experience was so unpleasant that I don't want to come back to shop at this store anymore !"
1033,ralphs-coffee-new-york-4,2019-01-13,5.0,Very nice coffee shop. I appreciated how there were other people but it wasn't completely insanely slammed like most coffee shops in NYC on Sunday. Good stuff.
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2020-02-10,3.0,"I have been to this Starbucks many, many times (during rush hour in the am) and have typically had a great experience, until today. I ordered my cold brew and waited nearly 20 minutes for it, meanwhile mobile orders were coming out left and right and people who ordered in line behind me were getting their drinks right away. The woman helping to hand out the drinks appeared to be clueless that I was waiting so long and was instead telling customers about her plans for Valentine's Day. One of the employees preparing a tea spent 5 minutes, on just putting on a lid alone. When I asked where my coffee was, I was told ""you're next in line."" False. I waited another 7 minutes. The woman next to me ordered a cold brew as well and was furious, asking if her order was next and the employees were straight up ignoring her. At one point an employee was yelling at another one telling her not to walk away from checking on that customers order! So unprofessional. I was tempted to ask for a refund, but as soon as I was making a move my cold brew arrived. I dont mind sticking it out and waiting, but the unprofessionalism and common decency to ask what I ordered being that I was standing right in front of them, was uncalled for, especially after I inquired and got a wish washy answer."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2020-03-09,2.0,"GCT is my stopover going to and from work. Most of the time I pass by this Starbucks store and today is my first time to stop by and get some chips and cake pops for my daughter. 

The manager must've stepped out because the staffs are in the mood of not paying attention to the customers, or perhaps they are just tired. Regardless, a prompt and corteous service is expected as a standard. Why would it take minutes for a staff to grab two cake pops? Oh, one of the crew forgot what ingredients/recipe goes to a coffee ordered by another customer. There are like 3 other customers waiting for their order and same as the tired staffs, the customers had a long day as well. The last thing we want to see is messing up our order and unprofessional behavior on the floor.

There is always room improvement and I believe it should start with the branch manager. Check how your guys are behaving and how well they know the business and just remind them they are not in a playground."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2019-10-08,4.0,"Major, major props to innovation to this team. There are not one, but TWO employees handling the drink pick up / mobile orders during morning rush hour, (refer to pictures). They EVEN busted out a separate standalone table for this!

This was so incredibly impressive, seeing as other locations in the midtown area can't get their shit together when it comes to mobile pick up. It can be SUCH a clusterfuck. Sometimes getting 2-3 lines deep of people, as if I was trying to order a whiskey ginger at my local shit hole bar at 1am on a Friday night. 

Thank you Starbucks - 7800 GCS,Track 35 for being on top of your shit and handling this like a pro. 

Keep at it!"

Just updating this post that this identical thing has happened to me 2 more times since my original post. The team here regularly has 10 people in line with 1 person working the register and 4 other employees just ""hanging around"" chatting, catching up, doesn't look like they're contributing to the business."

I then asked the guy for almond milk and he just said""we are out"" and turned around as I said soy or coconut. I waited, he did not get either. I then ask again, no answer.the girl closest to me grabs the soy milk and begins pouring some for her work, so I ask to have some, and she turns and stares at me as if I'm the rude person here in the Starbucks and the other worker looks and laughs. She then says ""yea you can"" and hands me the cup she's pouring full of soy milk.

It's a very small Starbucks and packed due to all the commuters popping in and out. The lines can be long but it moves very fast. Thus if you are catching a train you might want to use Starbucks mobile app so your order is waiting for you. I will use app next time because today I really thought I was going to miss my train due to large crowd waiting for orders.
The staff is courteous and really do try to prepare all drinks quickly.
Even though it's a small outpost you can pick up basics like bagels, oatmeal, take away food like sandwiches, cheese plate etc."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2019-05-05,1.0,"This location is absolutely horrible.  Despite  consistently placing orders on-line at least 15 mins prior, the drinks are never ready. Excuses range from ""the printer is broken"" to ""someone must have taken it"" and the staff has hit an all time low in simply walking away when you ask if your order has been received or is being made.  I mean literally, they look at you and walk away.   I've been beating my head against the wall going there for 5 years, but the odds of getting things right are now about 30%. 

I've been to Starbucks locations on five continents and the only horrible one is right here in NYC.  

Starbucks- fix that train wreck."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2019-10-24,1.0,Worst Starbucks.. 2 baristas just slowly chatting and taking their time when people were waiting for a long time. Had to ask register person for a refund after waiting 15 - 20 minutes for my drink and almost missed my train. He then came to tell the barista and I got my drink... which tasted so bad. I thought Starbucks at least should be consistent. Never again :(
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2019-07-26,1.0,Terrible service. Waiting 10+ minutes for an unsweetened iced tea without much of a line made me want to go behind the counter and make it myself. Also love seeing employees stand and watch as one person made all of the drinks. Useless.

1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2017-05-02,3.0,"I'm at this station a few times a month and if the line isn't too long I usually stop by for a drink. The service is decent, the hours are long so they have different staff for different shifts and the service is always in consistent. Sometimes they're extremely welcoming and friendly like how most Starbucks baristas are, and other times they don't know what they're doing even the basics of taking an order.

However, they do have an app to order online and pick up in store, thank god for that because it saves a LOT of time and hassle. The drinks have been okay, I've never had a bad drink from here yet so not much to complain about. Although they do always seem understaffed and it does take a while for the drink to come out. There are times where you'd wait 10 minutes for a drink but at a location like grand central, everyone is most likely in a rush or waiting for a train so not everyone has 10 minutes to spare for a cup of coffee. Management, service and staff definitely needs to improve."

It generally takes longer to receive your order here than at most locations, and every time I've visited my orders seem to be off...not wrong, just off. Too much milk, too much mocha, too much ice (watered down). There is no care or attention-to-detail given - they don't have the time to.

Can't beat the convenience, but it's not a good Starbucks."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2018-08-18,3.0,"This location really needs two separate reviews. Mon-Fri and Sat-Sun. Two completely different atmospheres. During the week these guys hustle! Not an easy task to keep up with the rush but they hold their own and do a fantastic job. 

The weekend on the other hand... No urgency at all. They're laid back and you wait 3x as long even with a call ahead order. I keep thinking it will get better, but it never does. I would avoid this location on weekends at all costs."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2018-02-09,3.0,"Positive/Negative: We have found this location to either consistantly maintain a line out the door (5:30-6:00am) which takes 10 minutes to move or no line at all.

Negative: Order drinks ahead if time is pointless at this location as they keep your order behind counter and workers are too busu to grab them.

Positive: All employees are pleasant and courteous"
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2018-12-20,1.0,"Today I waited 20 minutes for a mobile order coffee, when I got to the shop to pick up the order I thought to be ready (as I had ordered it almost 10 minutes prior) I found the shop was in chaos with baristas moving as if they where suspended in molasses and one clerk walking back and forth every 5 minutes screaming over the waiting crowd ""did anybody order any food"" the only saving grace of my morning was one barista (Earnest) doing the work of the entire shop pivoting through his coworkers to try and get things done. If he reads this thank you for finally coming to help me out. And for the rest of the staff, take a note from Earnest's book"
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2018-06-18,1.0,"The very DEFINITION OF INSANITY!!!  Why oh why do I continue to do this to myself day after day?!??  

Ridiculously long lines but you place your order fairly quickly.   Now try to survive the mind-numbing wait for your $8 cup of coffee huddled at the end of the long line with your fellow commuters faces down in cell phones.  Pray oh pray that your $8 cup of coffee is actually what you ordered.   

Note to YOU....your $8 cup of coffee order takes a long time to come out and usually is wrong!   Note to the dude filling up the milk and creams....you're the only one smiling and we all appreciate you for that!   Note To The Service Girl with the black and orange hair working the service counter handing out the coffee......ask for a transfer cuz this is NOT the spot for you!   

Chaos and Insanity is the only way to describe this daily ritual.  I haven't decided whether this is worth it anymore!   Let me think about it as I drink the $8 cup of coffee someone else ordered!!"
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2018-12-10,1.0,This location wouldn't serve me because I'm white!  That's a first for me and I certainly  will never buy from Starbucks again.
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2019-01-10,3.0,"This will be one of my favorite Starbucks to go to in the city. He atmosphere is always positive. New staff, makes you wonder why the old staff left. The customer service is always 100%, even when the staff is dealing with rude customers. It would be great to see the managers on the floor helping out when it is crowded or deal with customer issues, or help restock items. Overall my experience is always great. I would recommend this Starbucks if you are ever in Grand Central, but don't place an order on the app there is usually a line outside the door, which means their service is great and the demand for coffee is a high for that day."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2017-12-22,1.0,"This place takes way too long to make a simple cup of coffee. Also, Joseph the ""barista"" needs to get it together with the rinsing of the plastic cups he's using. Splashed me and other starbucks guest with watered down coffee...yuck! At least warn a person. Then he hands people their drink that's dripping wet on the sides. Starbucks is way to expensive to be acting all sloppy."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2015-01-24,4.0,"Its a Starbucks, a chain focused on supplying magical caffeine conveniently every four blocks. This location is right by track 37, across from Juniors on the main level. On weekday mornings, the line stretches out of the store toward the main hall.  While ridiculously crowded, the line moves fast - a barista will walk down the line to collect orders in advance of the register and minimize wait times. I think the staff works well together here even though its very high pressure. 

There is NO seating, only some counter space to stand. They also don't serve sandwiches or oatmeal, but can warm up a pastry."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2019-01-02,5.0,I usually place my mobile orders 10 mins prior to arrival and pretty much get my drink every time I get there despite all the chaos of Grand Central.
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2015-03-19,4.0,"The Starbucks is located in Grand Central terminal. Starbucks has everything every other Starbucks has. They do have a good selection of baked goods. It's located on tracks from 32 to 40.  More specifically track 37. 

The staff here is great the one guy kept joking around with me and one of the other employees. About how I'm in  his Starbucks fan club. In that he's the most famous cashier Starbucks is ever seen. He did tell me that he likes working here and I told him don't quit your day job buddy. 

Overall the Starbucks is a good place if you're headed to the train and you just want to grab a tea or a coffee for the ride back on the Hudson line."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2016-08-21,1.0,"Less than impressed at Starbucks Grand Central. High profile locations with high customer foot traffic always get a professional pass from me but you can't excuse straight rudeness. 

Customer service in its simplest form is basic connection between two people. How can a location miss that completely... 

I'll reference just a couple parts of the experience, firstly the lack of greeting, being handed a unfolded bag to pack the items myself and finally handing the Barista my card to pay and being directed with an eye roll to the merchant machine only to be told rudely that I had to insert my card because it has a chip

It's amazing how one interaction can turn a brand promoter into a detractor."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2019-02-14,1.0,"Ok, I have tried to give this location a chance so many times but, alas, I have to leave this review. Plainly speaking, this is the worst Starbucks location ever! I've been in Starbucks all through the country but this is a nightmare. Always something lost or not working, if you place an order beforehand in app, be ready to come and wait extra 20 min at least! You ask to cancel the order, they start making it! A lot of times the order was just partially prepared, so I still had to wait endless number of minutes for the order to be complete. Last week I just walked out with a cup of brewed instead of cappuccino, today same thing - walked out without any order or refund. The thing which annoys the most is when you're asking, politely, excuse me, could you, please, check that my order has gone through they answer, without looking at the order, it's coming! In 10 minutes you find out that the order hasn't even gone through! Nothing can be more disrespectful for a customer than lying. Common people, your customers see you."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2017-10-11,1.0,"Don't make the mistake of going there during morning rush hour. I ordered a very simple small drink, waited 10 minutes and never got the drink. At this point I was going to be late to work so I asked a cashier if I could cancel my drink order because I had to leave. He sucked his teeth and rolled his eyes as if my refund was coming out of his pocket. A nice young lady must have noticed how much he hated his job and came over to apologize and make my drink. I took 3 sips and had to toss it because I had no time to drink it so it was a waste of money. I've had bad service at this Starbucks before (again waiting a while for a pastry they forgot about). They can't seem to handle the volume. There are a million other Starbucks right outside of Grand Central. Go to one of those instead."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2016-01-21,2.0,"The people are friendly but I think operations needs to look into efficiency especially at this location since most people waiting for
Their coffee are also waiting for a train. Today I basically donated $5 to Starbucks because I couldn't miss my train and couldn't also wait any longer for my latte. There was also a general sense of disorganization unfortunately, with people asking about the status of their drinks and getting back shrugs."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2012-12-05,3.0,"Man, this is a tiny Starbucks location. It's like a piece of the normal store that they found this space for and decided to squeeze it in. I can imagine it can be crazy crowded during the morning rush, but when I was here yesterday around noon it was empty. Same bells and whistles as the rest. Got my peppermint mocha quickly and left. Place is all decked out in Christmas ornaments and trees.

No tables. No chairs. Just a small counter. Nowhere to sit. No wifi hogs!"

1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2016-06-18,1.0,Rudest customer service I've ever experienced. You would think having a Starbucks in grand central would be fast and efficient; complete opposite. They need to expand and train the staff ( or hire better people ) I would rather take my money and business and go to the other coffee shops in GCT.
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2010-05-11,3.0,"Armed with my award of a $5.00 Starbucks gift card from my workplace, I ordered a tall hot chocolate at $2.95 to replinish my warmth affection.  Hot chocolate brightens my sunshine stronger which were stolen by another typical man's constructive abandonment:  ""you're a great girl, but not for me.""

Service at this location which resides inside of Grand Central Terminal, Space MC-72 of the Lexington Avenue entrance is somewhat efficient and prompt."

1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2015-07-17,1.0,"Hands down, the WORST Starbucks I have ever been in. The baristas are usually engaged in private conversation to call ""next"".  Not enough staff to keep up with rush-hour needs. The floor is constantly filthy.  My order is wrong more than 50% of the time."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2013-12-02,5.0,"I wouldn't usually write a review for someplace like Starbucks because I feel that you're *usually* going to have the same experience regardless of where you go. BUT, I was there recently and had a great experience that I felt was worth noting. Sidenote: this was at the location directly across from Papyrus.

I was there on a weekend morning so it wasn't too busy but everyone working there was so friendly with a *genuine* smile on their face. I got my drink and noticed that the milk containers were empty so I brought it to the barista's attention and it was taken care of right away and they apologized to me. As the barista was refilling the milk containers at the little counter, he noticed that there were only small straws and that the girl next to me and myself both had venti drinks. Immediately, he said that if we wouldn't mind waiting a minute that he would see it there were large straws in the back. Sure enough, he comes back out with a package of large straws and hands one to each of us before refilling the rest of the bar.

Someplace like Starbucks is always going to have customers and a following but the people working here are just great...plain and simple."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2012-04-22,4.0,"I would have to say I love this Starbucks!

 They always remember me and my drink even if they do not remember my name. That is probably because I get my regular venti pike where they don't need my name to yell out. :)

I am here every day on the weekdays and till this day, I have no idea which individual is the Manager but they do have a perfect system down. Everyone is always so friendly. Shows great management and leadership. 

The line could be wrap around the Avenda store, but the wait is never long. Literally less than three minutes to the counter. No lie!!! I never hesitate when there is a line because I know they will go through quickly and still be personable. 

In every store, of course, there are always bad apples. This one, there are two. One guy and one woman. Worst attitude ever. Not personable. Rude when they cant hear you. Guy always works at the cashier. I always try to avoid him if i can. The woman jumps from making coffee to cashier. Neither one have been seen in front of the counter. It should stay that way."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2013-01-04,1.0,"Ok, so it's a Starbucks, but here's my story.

8:30am Christmas Day, and Joe The Art of Coffee in Grand Central is closed.  This is the only other option pre-train.  Order a gingerbread latte for my girlfriend, and a soy cappuccino for myself.  As I pick the coffees up I realize something is amiss, as mine weighs about half that of the latte.  Taking a sip outside, it turns out my 'coffee' was 3/4 froth, and some awful, scalding hot milk in the bottom.  I threw it out straight away, but with hindsight, I should have complained. Not the greatest problem in the world granted, but teaching your staff how to texture milk should be mandatory when you're charging people four bucks."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2016-07-09,3.0,"this good old bucky near track 37 in the grand central terminal is your typical starbucks with its order and go on your way vibe. no room to sit cause their ain't no place to sit but that's ok if you are catching a train or just got off one. the usual hot and cold drinks along with a glass covered counter with pastries , bagels , , salads, yogurts, etc. i never ordered during the weekdays. only weekends so i never have to wait long to order but at times when i do pass by on my way to work i do see a long line that seems to move quickly.the staff seems ok most of the time and do keep the place clean and well stocked but it's easy when you have limited space to deal with . i do notice the prices a bit higher then other near by locations but what do you expect from the mta but as long as my frappe is sweet and my blueberry scone is fresh then i am a happy camper."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2016-05-02,1.0,"This is consistently the worst Starbucks I have ever been to by far.  You would think that a Starbucks located in a train station would put efficiency and service as one of their priorities...  Not this one.  It is very disorganized and on multiple occasions I have had to give up my drink because it couldn't be completed in a reasonable amount of time (I'm talking 15 minutes) and I, like most people at this location have a train to catch.  The employees are usually somewhat friendly, but it's obvious that this location needs better management presence.  In addition to being disorganized, it is the dirtiest Starbucks (the floor and counters are always gross) that I have been to as well.  Let's hope that Starbucks figures it out at this location soon."
1034,starbucks-new-york-158,2013-07-15,3.0,"This place needs some more seating!!!  There is really no place other than the Starbucks to chill, people watch, and sip some coffee.  The fact that seating can be hard to come by (and no electrical outlets to plug in your devices) is a major drawback..  It is also off in the corner so if you want to pick up a quick drink before you hop on the train you better make sure you have enough time.     The employees are always super nice."
1036,corrado-bread-and-pastry-new-york,2019-04-07,5.0,"I worked near here for a few years and whenever we were having a work event and needed a dessert we always went here. It is on the pricey side, but it's on the UES, so what can you really expect?

Their carrot cake squares are divine and they are located to the top right of the sandwiches. They don't always have them, but If you want something small and you see them I'd definitely suggest trying them! 

Their little cookies, being the glass on the east wall, are absolutely adorable. I don't know who decorates their cookies but they're so quirky and oddly decorated that sometimes it's hard to tell if it's a dinosaur or a kangaroo, but at the same time extremely charming to have a decorated cookie that doesn't charge you more than $6. Our favorites were the chocolate men! Absolutely delicious. 

Most of the time we ordered cakes for work birthdays. The cakes are adorable and delicious. Most of them are chocolate of some sort and they're all decorated beautifully. The cakes are usually $40-60 depending on the size (I'm not sure the price of the individual small cakes.) We loved this place because they always had ready made cakes that we could walk in and buy, so we didn't have to order anything ahead of time, although they do accept orders ahead of time, and just as a warning one of the people who work there told me that they were considering getting rid of the cakes that you can walk in and buy, because sometimes they don't all sell. 

This place also has a ton of seating in the spring, summer, and fall. There are only about 6 cafe style tables inside, but when it's warm out they have seats and tables all along the outside south wall and it's a great place to people watch. 

Note for the gluten free kids, they only have one cookie that's gluten free and it's not great. I think they market it as some kind of butter cookie. Perhaps it would go better with coffee."
1036,corrado-bread-and-pastry-new-york,2020-01-12,3.0,"If you come here, there are GF options. The cheese puffs are the best thing to get here. Everyone orders it. Worth a try. It's not warmed, which would make it taste better and make it softer, but it's still okay. Avoid the cannoli -- there are better options in the city... tasted soggy and plain without much flavor."
1036,corrado-bread-and-pastry-new-york,2019-08-25,3.0,"Love the corner location and the sidewalk people watching from the 8 outside tables, which is to my knowledge the only seating they have...none inside. 

The format is:  first you go inside to order your food or coffee but you wait longer than you should have to to place your order, then the nasty counter people finally take your order, then you go outside to wait.  After ten minutes, you go back inside and ask if it's ready, but you have to wait in line again so the nasty counter help can take your money.  Then you grab a cafeteria tray and take your earl gray or croissant and head back outside and hope no one has taken your seat. It's all very annoying, unorganized and inefficient.  

Once seated, and breathing deeply to undo the stress of ordering and receiving your order, it's a decent spot to take an afternoon break....and as for the food...meh."
1036,corrado-bread-and-pastry-new-york,2019-02-08,5.0,"Nice place. Good pastries, sweet & savory. Good coffee. Not a lot of good spots near here for a quick breakfast. This serves a purpose. Also bagels available."

Decided to come in here for breakfast one morning and was pleasantly surprised to find that they have ""Cheese Puffs"" - which is actually the traditional Brazilian ""Pão de queijo"" cheese bread. The traditional recipe calls for manioc flour, as opposed to wheat flour, so they're gluten free - a common selling point for these delicious pieces of bread outside of Brazil. You can buy them plain, or as mini sandwiches, which I love getting for breakfast."

They told me they do not use Versi East anymore, even though this is the link they have on their website in three different placse as the online order link. I am so disappointed. I ordered for a 12 people's lunch. Now I have 12 Hangry people screaming at me about their lunch that hey waited two hours to eat. They need to remove this link for their website immediately. I aha ego go through all the trouble of getting a reimbursement from this company now. The manager was also quiet rude while trying to assist me with the issue.

1036,corrado-bread-and-pastry-new-york,2019-03-04,1.0,"I just had surgery to have my jaw wired shut and I am limited with what I can and cannot eat. My mom - who wanted speciality coffee (which she had to return twice because it was cold and not fresh before Corrado finally got it right) - and I were excited to see that they had chicken soup on the menu. Something full of nutrients that I could slurp through a straw! They gave me a tiny cup to try. The broth was fine as was the chicken. However, all of the vegetables were too large and chunky. 

We kindly asked them if they could either just provide a cup of the broth with the shredded chicken, if possible, or, if not, then just the broth. Both individuals here flat out refused to. The place was not busy so could have tried to be at least a tiny bit accommodating. Any restaurant in the city, which actually cared about its customers, would. We pointed out that the heavy vegetables sink to the bottom of the soup as it is so what they are saying does not make sense. They still flatly refused to provide anything. All of the soup as is or nothing. Pretty disappointing, and makes zero sense.

There are plenty of other places on the Upper East Side. Especially, ones who at least have employees that give a semblance of caring about those who are paying to keep the place open. 

AVOID CORRADO (70th/LEXINGTON) AT ALL COSTS!! GO ELSEWHERE WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T JERKS! This experience is just stupidly ridiculous."

1036,corrado-bread-and-pastry-new-york,2019-10-20,5.0,Great location near Central Park. The coffee is wonderful and the almond cookies and cheese puffs are to die for.
1036,corrado-bread-and-pastry-new-york,2015-11-12,4.0,"I adore Corrado Bread and Pastry but very sad the location between 63rd/64th closed. I knew it was a goner: I had the place pretty much to myself half the time. They spent a lot of money in TI's (something I learned when dating a land use consultant) and it was a wonderful place to hang out. 

I hate sitting inside 95% of Starbucks. The only two I can tolerate on the UES when my WiFi dies--as it does far too often because I am technologically cursed--are 66th/3rd and 63rd/Lex. I avoid the ""commuter"" Starbucks and with Fika in Midtown East and the UES, I try to limit my exposure to Starbucks to 4 minutes (about what Andy Borowitz says any right-thinking American can take of Ted Cruz--slightly up from 3 minutes some time ago but less than the 6 minutes one can tolerate if the sound is muted). 

So Corrado, formerly Le Pain Quotidien before the move to 65th/Lex, was my local place to chill before it's respectable to start drinking at a bar (Fishtail) when Happy Hour begins. 

This location (the original, I believe) is nice in the summer: 70th/Lex is a great corner and it's pleasant to sit on the patio and benches. The inside is cramped and not very comfortable. But I'm addicted to the mini-tuna on brioche and the mini-cannoli is wonderful too. (I'm sure the maxi-cannoli is equally wonderful but try to be good). 

If you want more elaborate, fancy desserts like passionfruit mousse and various complex chocolate concoctions, you will love Corrado. The sandwiches are all good and they have the best chicken soup not in a Jewish deli. Also the grapefruit juice is great and only 2 dollars. 

It's an oddly reasonable place for the location (compared to pastries and deli food at  Dean and Deluca and other local places), Corrado is a downright bargain)."
1036,corrado-bread-and-pastry-new-york,2016-10-05,4.0,"Nice discovery over here at UES. To be honest, I really got attracted by their huge pastry collections, and clearly, sweet ones were also on the higher quality side. Just look at that huge piece of pecan cake glittering on the shelf, or that daily freshly baked croissant...oh no, cannot resist this temptation.

They were using the Gramercy beans for their daily brew - definitely not as intense as the other beans, yet quite balanced with milk."
1036,corrado-bread-and-pastry-new-york,2016-07-18,4.0,"I've grabbed breakfast with a friend here a couple of times, and it is always a treat. The breads are very, very good, and they offer a lot of different pastry options that are both savory or sweet. Prices are premium. 

It can get a little packed in here, but generally the clientele is good about not hogging seats. 

The people who work here are speedy and are good with the rush of people."

1036,corrado-bread-and-pastry-new-york,2015-03-08,4.0,"I needed some food after my visit to the Frick Collection & popped in to check out the cakes in this cafe. There was a large selection of cakes and sandwiches so decided to stay. I asked the server for a recommendation for the best brownie, as they have about 5! It was suggested I try the white chocolate brownie and it was really good. I can be a bit fussy with brownies and this was near perfect. It was a generous size, I could probably have split it, but was greedy and ate it all! It had a firm cake type texture with a crunch. 

I thought it was a bonus that they had indoor seating (and a restroom!). The staff were really friendly & I think a cake & soda for $4.25 was a bargain. Next time I'd like to try their sandwiches or bread."

I ordered an Americano, which was so incredibly hot that I couldn't drink it.  My friend and I also ordered a Latte.  We concluded that all of the drinks were ""OK"".  We also ordered a couple of scones.  Both the cranberry and blueberry scones were decent.  They were moist, which was nice, but again, just ""OK"".

The staff wasn't overly friendly, but they weren't mean either.  Just going through the motions of getting people in/out.

I think I may come back and give their sandwiches a try, but I'll go elsewhere to get my coffee.  Corrado is in a great location, so if you're in the neighborhood and you just want to grab something quick, this may be a good choice."
1036,corrado-bread-and-pastry-new-york,2017-11-03,2.0,"I think I'm being rather nice on giving this place 2 stars instead of 1, but all I wanted is a cup of coffee and I wanted to pay with my Visa and with NO sign posted at the Point-of-Sale that a minimum payment is needed, the employee there said $5 minimum, and so I walked out WITHOUT a coffee, since I really don't carry cash on me. 

With that being said, if you have a minimum amount for credit card transaction, my advice to you is post a sign saying ""$5 minimum on Credit Card"" either at the register and/ or at the door.  It's not hard and it may save you from losing business. 

Have a nice day!"

The two ladies behind the counter seemed like they really want to get people in and out of the place. Everything here is mostly premise and is on display behind the counter. The petite sandwiches were much smaller than I imagined in my head. I decided to go with the mozzarella/proscuitto/tomato sandwich which was $4.75 and $5.15 after tax. The sandwich itself was very thin (as shown in picture) I think it's good for a light snack but it definitely won't fill you up if you're a fatty like me. ^_^ But on a serious note, I was a little afraid that the bread would be a bit hard, but it was not bad at all. Perhaps it was the smaller portions of the prosciutto but it wasn't too salty..it was just right. At the end, I enjoyed the sandwich, but it wasn't anything special. I probably wouldn't walk 8 blocks to go there just for the sandwiches but perhaps if I ever happen to pass by in the future."

I stumbled across this beautiful little bakery and now I'm obsessed. Just the quality and look of the pastries look like they cost the world and then some. They have reasonable prices and they have the quality of a Michelin star French bakery. The best pastries I have tasted. It is definitely my favorite place for breakfast, their sweets are very much up to the standard of French pastries. It's not too sweet and perfectly compliments coffee if you like coffee that is.. I even brought friends with me and they agree 100% ."

The coffee was good. There were also tables outside, which was nice.

It was really between 3 and 4 stars because I definitely wasn't blown out of the water but at the same time, it wasn't bad at all - location and customer service got them to a 4."

The best thing about Corrado is their customer service. It's fantastic!  Actually, it's a tie w/ their Fab pastry items. Coffee is great and extremely reasonable too. Tiny round tea sandwiches are delish...! And the quiche is great & inexpensive for NYC. 

Having been coming to this new location frequently even tho it's further from me. It's on E side of Lex b/t 63rd & 64th. But the location on corner of Lex & 70th has my heart cuz that's where I was 2 years ago when I made the decision we were moving to NYC (finally got here August 1!) and I  the owners who were sweet & humored me when I announced to them...""guess what, I'm going to move here!""

Weather is super nice after the horrible weekend, so I decided to grab a scone and iced coffee and sit outside in the shade before I went to work.

Place is on the cutesy side, and servers are nice. Iced Coffee is a bit overpriced at $2.75 and pastries are ok for the cost, but some are hit or miss as far as taste goes. 

In my opinion it is really a 2.5 star rating, but will give it 3 stars for the friendly staff and outside seating in the shade."

The coffee is soft and tasty, but served a little too tepid and weak for my taste.  But the pastries more than make up for the lackluster coffee. The cranberry scone is huge and tasty and delicious in every way, baked to a slight crisp on the outside with a soft fluffy inside. The orange bread is tasty but subtle, a perfect treat if you're looking for something *not too sweet. If you're gluten-free, go for the GF cheese puffs - they are excellent!"

Nice wicker Parisian-style table and chairs outside where you can hang for awhile.  Inside was small but quaint.  I ordered a small strawberry shortcake and ice tea, it was under $10 which I didn't think was too bad.  

In the display case there was a lot more, nice salads and sandwiches that looked very fresh and expertly prepared.  I want to come back and try more, and also buy some of their bread.  It satisfies as a good place to stop by for whatever you need in the afternoon, which was exactly what I was looking for."

I still have yet to venture out and try their other breakfast items, but their croissants are always fresh, lattes hit the spot. The staff there are very warm and friendly. 
When weathers warm up, they have several tables set outside for guests to sit and enjoy the sun while people-watching. For a quick lunch I normally have their prosciutto sandwich, delish!"

The inside is very minimalist-- white walls and pale wood. It's a small place with only 4 chairs with wooden counters along the outer perimeter. 

This was my first time trying a flat white, and I am very impressed. A flat white is a kind of cappuccino originally from Australia. They take the steamed, frothy milk from the bottom of the jug and hold back the foam at the top so you get a velvety texture. I substituted in for oat milk, and it's still super creamy. 

They also offer seasonal drinks (hot apple cider, etc.) and small pastries."

Latte here has a nice espresso kick to it. The shop also offers various kinds of pastries and few seats here and there. I'd love to hang out here with a friend with a cup of coffee in hand.

They will give you 25 cent discount if you get your drink in your reusable cup! Some pastries here were from pain d'avignon, and some others it seems like they baked in-house. How awesome!"

The butter croissants looked so good that I couldn't resist, so I got one with a latte. The croissant was delicious, flaky on the outside, buttery and rich, it paired well with the latte that had perfect art and the taste was magnificent. 

They had a large variety of great coffees from roasters all across the US. They even had Ritual coffee, one of the roasters."
1037,black-fox-coffee-new-york-4,2020-01-12,4.0,"TLDR: Another outpost of Australian coffee shop, Black Fox. Try the Espresso Tonic for something different and yes, the chocolate chip cookie is great.

Found myself in the area running errands and figured I'd give it a try. There is no shortage of coffee shops in this area but Black Fox does have some unique offerings.

I asked for something signature and they recommended the Espresso Tonic. As the name implies, it's a glass of tonic with lemon bitters, a lemon slice and espresso poured over. It definitely takes a bit to get used to. Kind of reminds me of when you have an Italian espresso and you get the lemon rind with the side of sparkling water. Imagine all of that immersed in a drink with lots of ice and I think there was some sweetener added too.

The chocolate chip cookies here are a signature offering. They are very buttery, large chocolate chunks and on the denser side. Very delicious, I wonder if it's possible to heat those up.. I think that would give it that special touch.

All in all, it's nice to have another option in this area."
1037,black-fox-coffee-new-york-4,2020-05-05,4.0,Though this was my least favorite coffee I've had in the city the environment of this coffee shop wasn't bad.

I would be willing to give this place a second chance next time I'm in the area .
1037,black-fox-coffee-new-york-4,2019-12-30,4.0,"Didn't get any caffeine fix since it was already too late in the day, but got my sweet fix. 

I was afraid this location's cookies might be different than their downtown location. 

But nope, they are consistent - still soft and chocolate super melty as though it just came out of the oven. How do you guys do it? 

I only took off one star because the cashier gave me croissant rather than pain au chocolat, but charged me for the latter. 

But regardless of this mixup glad they finally opened in midtown."
1037,black-fox-coffee-new-york-4,2020-02-19,4.0,"Everybody coffee shop at one point boasts about offering the best coffee in the city, and so goes any credibility. That said, it's a pleasant surprise when the claim is backed up. Of all Australian coffee spots in the city, I enjoy Black Fox the most with its diligent and knowledgeable staff. Their filtered drips, espressos, and lattes pass all the taste tests. The pastries are pretty darn good too, not to mention they are made in-house!  Loving chocolate chip cookies may sound basic, but BF makes them damn good. It is exciting whenever Midtown gets quality coffee for a change. Let's just hope BF stays awesome and not expand too fast at the expense of quality!"

I walked over with a coworker one day, we work on 5th ave and this place is so convenient. Warm and welcoming feeling as soon as you walk in and the aroma of the place is unmatched. They have plenty of food options with many variety of different cultures and cuisines. 

There was plenty of seating in case you wanted to dine in. In the case you're unsure of what to have, there's a big sign that shows the food the place has and the name of the place underneath. EX: FRIED CHICKEN : BobWhite or MIDDLE EASTERN : Taim. To top if all off, some place even have happy hour for the people that enjoy a boozy lunch.

The first meal I had was at Bao By Kaya and I got a popcorn chicken bowl which was tasty. It came with some really good garlic cream sauce and another sauce all over the popcorn chicken, rice, veggies, corn and egg. My mom got the two pork Bao buns with gyoza meal. The food was not that pricey for the amount of food we got. 

The second meal I got from here was at Roberta's and was just a margarita pizza and a beer. The pizza was very thin and had a delicious crust. I really liked the pizza from this place. A large is enough for 2 people to share. My beer threes brewing beer was also good. This is a great food hall to stop by in to get a break from the busy city. Also makes for a good food choice for those indecisive pickers. Lot of different options."

All kinds of cuisine here, from ramen to Italian subs. A few places serve beer.

Bao Buns - I thought the spring rolls would be made with rice paper. Instead they were standard deep fried veggie rolls. Not worth the calories. The 
baos however were great and filling! Fatty duck, lots of meat.

My friend liked her Baja Mex food. It's an indoor food court with better food that you'd find at most mall food courts. I like how these are popping up all over the city. Reasonably priced, satisfying, quick meals for folks with busy schedules."

I'd love to try the ramen, veggie bowls, and sushi next time! I hear it's a mob scene during lunch hour which didn't seem like fun to find seating and to look around at options with indecision.

Urbanspace has a lot to choose from, but sometimes I don't know what I want so I do a few walk around  to narrow it down to maybe the ramen spot Kuro-Obi or the Mexican spot Dorado Tacos & Quesadillas , or maybe  some buns from Bao by Kaya counter this time?

But that what makes Urbanspace a great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner is the selection  like a mecca with a wide variety of vendors serving tacos, sushi, pizza, seafood, buggers, Indian, salads, beer or wine, etc. etc.  Sometime an old vendor goes out and a new one in.

Benefits from its smaller portions so you can try different things. Price adds up as you add dishes.

Food (3/5): I've tried a few spots in the court:

Liquiteria - Grabbed a Big Green smoothie here and was quite satisfied. Fresh and fruity without the arm and leg cost of a Pressed or Joe & the Juice.

Bao - I've tried their pork bao and their duck bao. Delicious!

Taim - Fresh falafel and tabouli was great. Their pickled onions were on point! Unfortunately they had run out of hummus when I ordered, but I've heard great things.

Atmosphere (4/5): Great space to roam and find a spot to eat. There is seating upstairs with lots of room.

Uniqueness (4/5): Great variety! Lots of new fusion and experimental dishes that I appreciate.

Value (4/5): A little pricey when you start stacking different dishes. If you want a filling and affordable lunch, I would try somewhere else. Otherwise, great way to spend some time in a market without traveling to Chelsea or to Brooklyn/Queens."

When the space opened over a year ago, I was excited for the concept and this place used to be one of my staple lunch spots given the variety of options.

However, I haven't been coming here as often since it's started to resemble more of a factory assembly line.  It gets VERY packed during peak lunch hours and because the vendors need to cater to the masses, food quality has gone down.

I have tried a majority of the vendors here and found the food to be average on a whole.  If you are looking for a quick meal, I would recommend the following:

1. Taim - Mediterrean vendor that always has a line. The falafel platters are a popular favorite.

2. Bobwhite - Fried chicken is decent but pricey (i.e. skip the salad though which is plain highway robbery)

3. Bao By Kaya - Most of the platters are decent, including the red curry and the taiwanese lu rou.

4. Roberta's - Personalized pizzas.  Do only come here if you have half an hour to kill since pizzas are made to order.

Additionally, there's seating and bathrooms upstairs.  Vendors do rotate in/out and differ from the Vanderbilt location.  Overall, it is not a bad place for a quick meal, but at these prices, I'd probably skip."

From Thai to Mexican to Indian to Japanese to Korean to Smoothies to Coffees, and the list goes on. I settled for Mac n Cheese from one spot and a Veggie Bao Bun from another spot.

1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2019-08-10,3.0,"Came here at 12:30 after summer streets on a Saturday

I've heard about my colleagues purposely taking a subway stop to eat at Urban Space, not sure if it's this one though. 

Came here because it was a close option near where I ended summer streets and seems like the place is chill, lots of seats.

As I scrolled through yelp, I was mainly attracted to the pizza. Even after arriving nothing really appealed to me, so I just went for the original pizza idea.

I spent a bit too long figuring out what to order. I ended up deciding between famous original and famous pep. The only difference is one had pepperoni and one didn't. I felt like avoiding salty pepperoni so went for famous original. 

When it came out, I regret not ordering the large. They had a sample of the sizes, but somehow I viewed both to be bigger than they actually are. Just the pizza plate looks larger than an actual pizza on the plate...

Glad to see my pizza come out smoking hot. I was disappointed in that I started questioning if I actually wanted the famous original...or did I really want a margherita... because I was jealous of this pie that came out same as mine that had basil...

The dough is thin and surprisingly crunchy. With the cheesy flavor of the crust, this tastes more like dough sticks than pizza dough (don't tell me they're the same...)
They use fresh mozzarella but it was cut so thin. I guess it matches the thinness of the crust. 
I've never specifically had caciocavallo cheese but I have a feeling that's what's giving the cheesy breadstick flavor  
There's supposed to be oregano and chili on there. Flakes for both? I vaguely remember having those. Some bites were more earthy and some were more fruity sweet. I'm assuming this is due to different ratios of oregano and chili. Not exciting regardless 
I kind of like and don't like the burned bits on the dough. It gave nice charred flavor at times 

Most of the stands gave compostable containers (good!) but my pizza was on a platter (well I did say dine in). I was wondering what to with the platter since there was no tray return area. Luckily an employee came around to clear our trash and I didn't need to figure out what to do  not sure where he took it though. 

It's nice to have the sitting area with so many seats, but I can also imagine how packed it can be on weekdays. What threw me off what how COLD and WINDY the seating area is. My food got cold so quickly and I started freezing really soon after I finished eating. Even walking out to  mid 80 degree weather didn't feel hot. 
No good no good 

My two friends bought food from different stands within this US. All three of us felt that the food was meh. The idea of US is better than it's execution. The prices aren't cheap either. I can totally get something yummier at a cheaper price elsewhere.

UrbanSpace is on the smaller size of food halls with around a dozen stands serving up breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks. The stands vary from ramen and sushi to juices and empanadas. You'll find something here for all audiences and dietary restrictions. 

To give you a deeper taste, they also had a Middle Eastern stand, bao, Taiwanese street food, cookie dough stand and a taco bar. Seating was easy to find in the evening hours with both high tops and picnic tables available. I recommend taking a slow lap before making any decisions. Better yet, if you have a group, divide and conquer all of the menus with family style eating of what you gather.

1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2018-09-05,4.0,"Great selection of different types of food- lobster roll, sushi, sandwich, etc

I come here for the ramen. kuri obi is my favorite! I get the spicy ramen and an egg add-on. Super quick and delicious. Plenty of space to sit- there is an upstairs. 

The ramen is on point! Great place to get a quick bite to eat."
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2018-09-10,3.0,"Urban Space is the newest food hall to pop up in NYC where they are starting to bubble up everywhere.

The food hall concept to me is trying to bring the up-casual or trendy foods at your favourite resto spots and bringing it all under one roof so that you can enjoy a taste of them. It's a place for spin-offs and new food ideas to live and be creative.

It's a very nice looking food hall with a lot of choice from ramen, fusion tacos, pizza, sushi, coffee, paninis, seafood, etc. 

We strolled around the downstairs scoping out what we would want to sample as well as viewing the upstairs where all the food court style seating is located. We were here just before the lunch rush so we had the time to do it. Once lunch hit around 12:30PM, people started streaming in and I was so curious to see which stalls had lines. Let the people vote with their stomachs. 

I think the clear winner was Bob White's Lunch and Supper Counter.

Before the rush, we finally decided to sample Kuro-Obi and Roberta's Pizza. I liked the pizza more than the ramen concept if I had to choose."
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2018-10-12,5.0,"I have a few updates to include since I've tried a few other places here:

Dorado:  

I've had the Tacos and the Bowl here.  I had the Veggie Tacos and thought they tasted pretty good.  I probably should have tried the Mushroom Tacos, but didn't get a chance to do so.  I had a pair of tacos which didn't feel too heavy for a lunch, but you may want 3 if you want a more filling lunch.  At $3.75/taco, it's pricy, but we're at Urbanspace.  

The bowl is good for the most part, but you're getting a similar deal at other places such as Dos Toros and Chipotle, so you're not getting anything terribly different here.  And at $10.95, you're probably better off with the tacos.

Taim:

I had the harissa falafels here.  I got the platter, which is a bit easier to eat at my desk than the pitas, though the salad option is pretty good too.    I like the combo of different items the platter brings.  The falafels had a nice kick to them.  The tabouli and Isreali Salad was solid.  The pickles and peppers added more of a kick too.  I wish the tahini sauce was added either on the side or away from the hummus because it got mixed in together.  Otherwise the platter tasted great.  At $12.50, it's pricey, but again we're at Urbanspace.

Empanada Papa:

So this place is new.  And this place is the reason I'm still keeping the 5.  Wowza, the empanadas are awesome!  Get yourself an empanada combo that gets you 2 empanadas and a side for $10.50.  I got the cheese empanada and the Esquites (corn with pepper).  The cheese one was beyond dope and the Esquites had a nice kick to them.  You get to choose a sauce with the empanadas.  I got the medium sauce (green sauce), which was pretty good for me.  If you got an appetite for spicy food, I'm sure the hot sauce isn't too bad.

My side were the yuca fries.  I debated between that and the chips, but settled for the yuca fries.  You get 4 yuca fries, which look like mozzarella sticks along with their signature ketchup mayo.  The ketchup mayo + yuca fries combo is ill.  Awesome taste.  

For the price and taste, this was an excellent option for lunch."
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2019-01-17,4.0,"This is similar to the Pennsy's set up in Penn Station. This has been a welcome addition to NYC. Urbanspace takes the food truck concept and brings it indoors for all types of weather. I've only been here once but it's a clean space, and when I am in the area again I'll go back. 

I tried a lobster roll which was fantastic, but they have a bit of everything here. I've heard amazing things about Bob White. You can stay to eat but there isn't a lot of seating. Service is quick and you can grab whatever combo of things you're looking for and head out."
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2018-06-11,5.0,"Vegan Mecca. Here's a breakdown of the vegan options I've tried thus far. 

Inday GoGo:
The basmati rice bowl with added chickpeas is great, as is the salad with added chickpeas. So flavorful, so colorful. Enough veggies in there to make you feel healthy. The cauli rice bowl with green kebab left me hungry and unsatisfied. The green kebab balls were tiny, light as air and there were only a couple of them. All around not hearty enough to get me through the afternoon. The staff and menu here are the most vegan friendly of all (and/or maybe just friendly!). 

Taim:
The falafel platter is delicious if you're looking for a heavy vegan lunch. Creamy hummus, perfectly fluffy and fresh pita. Both the harissa and green falafel are great -- crunchy on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside). I'm not a huge tabbouli fan but this was pretty good - not too parsley-y. And the Israeli salad was whatever - vegetables, great. If you're looking for a lighter option, the green falafel salad is one of the best vegan salads in town (I add hummus for added protein and pickles to complete the flavor family). The lemon-mint dressing adds incredible brightness (though, you may want to order it on the side since it tends to pool at the bottom). 

Dorado tacos:
The veggie Baja bowl (ordered without cheese, crema and the salad dressing) is a flavorful, veggie-ful and hearty lunch option. With yellow rice and black beans, pico and guac, some tortilla chips, grilled zucchini and red pepper, and a little lettuce-salad situation. 

Baos by Kaya:
FYI, the tofu is deep fried in the same vat of oil as the meat, but I consider it to be vegan enough for me. The Buddha rice bowl (ordered without the green sauce and garlic sauce) is pretty good - the tofu's got great crispy crunchy flavor and they give you plenty of it. In my opinion, the coconut rice is what steals the show and adds subtle, but magical flavor throughout the dish. The veggies in the bowl (canned corn and shredded cabbage and kale) are kind of a throw away. Would love to see anything done to elevate these. The sweet chili sauce is fine but a little over powering - next time I'll get hoisin instead. Really wish the sesame noodles were vegan but there is egg in the noodles!

Takumi Taco:
The teriyaki bowl with tofu tinga was a protein fest. Brown rice, black beans, pinto beans, edamame and the tofu, with a tiny amount of veggies. The tofu had a nice texture - baked and marinated, had more of a Mexican flavor to it than Japanese (intentional, this place is fusion). All around it was good but needs some balance with some more veggies, more cool and crunch - maybe just make the slaw a bigger part of the dish. 

Little Collins:
Incredible oat milk iced latte. And great cold brew. Even a milk drinker will love their oat milk drinks."
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2018-12-04,4.0,"This is like the food court in a mall, except there is no mall. Jut the food court. ​

You won't go hungry at Urbanspace (the former home of my beloved Mr. K's). There was enough variety to satisfy my hungry brood.

We had:

- Ramen - very tasty and salty, just like what good ramen should be

- Fried Chicken Sandwich - the go-to​ meal for the 10 and under set

- Hamburger - another go-to meal for the 10 and under set

- Dough - cookie dough for dessert. I am not a fan of this (I prefer​ the real deal - take me raw eggs, take me!!) but the kids like it

If you can't find something to eat here, you are just being difficult!"
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2019-02-20,4.0,"I pop by every now and then. The turnover rate seems to be high, so don't bet on one shop being there forever. 

The food's pretty good though and the selection is decent. There's usually a range - sushi, ramen, baos, pizza, thai, indian, açaí bowls, beer, etc. Great, easy, fast meal. 
The baos are great and the pizza (particularly bee sting) is really good - spicy with a kick of honey. 

Seating is plentiful because there's also an upstairs section. Can get a little cold with the air conditioning up there. 

Do not come during rush hour. Lunch is jam packed and the wait isn't worth it. Dinner is a little better but it's still pretty full."
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2019-06-25,4.0,"One of the few closest places I can conveniently get food that's relative close to Park Ave and make it back to work within 30 minutes. They have a variety of food you can choose from: tacos, sushi, ramen, pizza, asian fusion, thai, poke bowl, and the list goes on. Some of the place are pretty interesting to try and others are just plain not worth it at all. Up to you to decide!"
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2019-03-07,3.0,"A food court for fast service and decent midtown prices. The food quality is average in general, though there are different types of cuisines to choose. It's ideal for quick work meals or drinks on weekdays, but not for date nights. 

Despite food quality, I found most vendors working there are super friendly. I even got a free entree from a Chinese place!"
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2019-03-17,3.0,"Came here for a quick lunch and got Taim to try.  I've been here once before for the sushi spot by the front door.  The first floor is a bit crowded and cramped during peak time so avoid that time.  There are seats upstairs.

Because of the location, I imagine the rent here is expensive and why the food here is expensive.  I'm not sure if this will be a regular spot for me since I can realistically only come during lunch.  It is way too crowded for me to spend that kind of money for lunch when I can go elsewhere and be more comfortable.  

That said, the food stalls here are pretty good.  Tried the sushi spot, Taim and the taco place in the back.  They should also allow the back door to open instead of forcing everyone in and out towards the front.  Traffic flow will be much better, especially during peak lunch time."

1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2018-04-24,4.0,"Urbanspace is a food court off Lexington at 51st St. It was near where I was staying so we came here a few times to grab some food when we didn't want to go to a sit down restaurant for dinner.  

It's a good sized food court in midtown, near hotels, residences, offices, so it can be quite busy during lunch and dinner time. We mainly came later in the evening so there was not much of a crowd, actually it looked like it they were about to start cleaning up and closing up shop in the next hour when we came by.

A lot to choose from so we had to do a few laps to narrow it down to a few spots. We chose the ramen spot Kuro-Obi and the Mexican spot Dorado Tacos & Quesadillas.

We got a bowl of their ""Kuro-Obi"" (black belt) ramen bowl with some takoyaki on the side. Creamy rich broth, unsure what kind of noodles but they were pretty good, good pieces of chashu pork, mushrooms, scallions and a dash of some miso paste and probably some other stuff. Takoyaki was good but we took that to-go and it got soft in the to-go box, but it was flavorful. 

The chicken quesadilla at Dorado was quite good, nice & crispy tortilla, nicely grilled up, chicken was flavorful, wish they went heavier on the cheese but we all wish that. If you add guacamole to it, they will add it inside of the quesadilla, not on the side. 

Overall, I like these hipster-ish food courts/food halls/food markets all over NYC. Good amount of seating and ledges upstairs & downstairs or you can take it to-go like I did. Some places are card only so if you try to pay in cash, you are from another world."
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2018-05-09,5.0,"I'm enamored with UrbanSpace. This seems to be the new trend all around the city and I'm loving it.  This brings back memories of food courts from yester-years but with a new modern chic vibe.  This review is for the Eastside 51st and Lex. location.  Inside this brand new UrbanSpace, houses 16 different eateries...like Little Collins, Rockaway Clam Bar, Bao, and  Ippudo Ramen & Buns just to name a few!

Good eats surround you once you enter the revolving door.  If you walk a few steps in, you'll meet the foot of the stairs leading up to the seating area where you can enjoy your eats in a casual setting.  At the same set of stairs, there are arrows pointing out where everything is.  Best part, if you're with companions and are all undecided as to what to eat, that's ok... everyone can split up and go anywhere to buy their food and reconvene upstairs.  The space is easy to navigate and even though the place is bustling with foot traffic, it's still very chill and easy to manuver.

Each food counter has it's own line and ropes to keep it organized.  Since it was my first visit, I made sure I walked through the entire place and checked out the menus for each.  There were so many choices -- sushi, tacos, salads, Italian fare, ramen, fried chicken, burgers, and Bao's.  So fun exploring each menu.

My friend and I agreed to try the Rockaway Clam Bar. First there are no restaurants near me that serve this and second, the menu looked awesome. And awesome it was...I ordered the Fried Clam Strips. They were crispy and came with a pesto or herb like tartar sauce.  And for a few bucks more, I made it a combo where you get to pick a side and a fountain drink or water. Cool deal.

We took our food upstairs and chowed down for 45 minutes. I noticed how clean the dining space was. There was a porter walking around cleaning each table that had finished and left.  He was also assisting with keeping the common area orderly.  There were three bins for your garbage: compost / recycling / and general waste. So this place is also environmental.  

Loved this first visit. Excited to return. And note the hours, they're open from 6:30am - 11pm. That covers your meals for the entire day!!"
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2019-07-24,1.0,"One of the absolute WORST meals of my life @ Thaimee Magic. I had a Thai curry from Thaimee today. The rice was partly burnt, the chicken was not fully done (eww), there were chunks of some weird vegetable I couldn't even figure out what it was and it was just a horrible flavor profile. I was hungry so forced myself to eat 1/4th of my plate only to trash the rest. Worst $12 I ever spent. Overpriced and awful! My friend had pad Thai with beef and hated it as well. He said his beef tasted like rubber. 
Also this is the 3rd joint I have tried at Urban space and the first two were nothing special either. I feel like the food overall in this food court is overpriced and disappointing. Meanwhile there are TONS of amazing food all over the area so I'd recommend go elsewhere."
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2018-03-28,5.0,"The newest big food hall to open is just a short walk away from the popular Urbanspace Vanderbilt, and operated by the same group.

Just like that one, there are a bunch of really good vendors (Inday, Taim and Roberta's, the last of which is actually located in both), and some throwaways that are there just to make sure every office worker's palate is satisfied.

So definitely go for the exciting new stuff, like the Inday Go Go concept that has roti and more of the great stuff from the original Inday, and Taim, which is serving new breakfast stuff for the first time.

This location is two floors, with mostly seating upstairs, but room for a few more vendors that will eventually come in. I'm hoping they are dessert-related, as sweets are the one area that is severely lacking in the market so far."
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2018-04-30,5.0,"Ahhh Roberta's, taim, and bobwhite all in one place that's enclosed and protected against the elements and right next to the train?

The suit and tie men are abundant here at lunchtime. Other that that gripe this space has large potential to fill my belly with future regrets when I try to put skinny jeans on.

I hadn't tried bobwhite until I ventured here and damn it's a good piece of fried chicken. If my belly could handle it the above three would be polished off immediately. 

But I have to get into a bathing suit soon. So I hope this space will stick and the suit and ties and other people will keep it alive.

Happy eating!"

First up is Roberta's love me some brick oven pizza can't go wrong with a classic , cheeses Christ or white guy all great options w plenty of cheesy goodness. 
Next Bob White lorddd that Fried chicken sandwich was amazing, perfectly fried well seasoned & very juicy great tasting sandwich.  Also tried the Mac & cheese this was not bad could use more cheese, more sauce. 
Drinks from Top hops during happy hour we gave the Rosé a try very nice. The Delirium beer is good, a bit on the bitter side but not bad nice & cold. 
Do Cookie Dough.. the cookie dough is good nice & sweet tasting.
Empanada papa seems to be the newest edition here I gave the Cheese empanada a try not bad, good amount of cheese .. highly overpriced tho!! 
Decent options here, price wise kinda pricey in comparison but not terrible assuming u are not eating here everyday. 
Nice open space w seating below & on the second floor, decent  place to grab a bite or quick drink."

The tuna taco was tasty. Seemed like a mayonnaise based sauce coated the tuna. It was in a crispy shell made from (I think) rice flour or puffed rice. The braised beef was in standard corn tortillas. His was just mediocre. There was a lot of beef topped with a sauce and scallions. Not bad. The salad had a nice rice vinegar ginger dressing, and the brown rice and beans were as expected (no special sauce or topping, but a good compliment). I wishe the tacos had some more heat. 

My friend got chix tenders from a different stand. Good fried chicken, really buttery fluffy biscuit. Fries were too salty and not as crispy as I like them. 

This place has a lot of options and different things to try. For the things I tried, I would eat again if I'm the area, but wouldn't go out of my way for to eat them again. However I would go back to Urbanspace to try other things."

We're talking Little Collins, Zai Lai, Bob White's Fried Chicken, Rockaway Clam, Dorado Tacos, Roberta's, Taim, Pecora Bianca! There's the perf mix of anything you'd ever be in the mood for. Great place for groups. Plus - there's a beer/wine bar on the 1st floor!

Can get SUPER hectic during weekday lunchtime. I'm talking like 12pm on the dot and the place is SWARMING, no matter what day of the week, but Friday is notably worse. If I ever grab something from here, I will be THAT person getting lunch at 11:45 just to avoid the rush!

A group of my close friends who live in the neighborhood and I decided to do Urbanspace for a Sat lunch shortly after they opened. We literally got EVERYTHING to share. Standouts include Old Bay tots from Rockaway Clam, Roberta's pizza, Taiwanese popcorn chicken from Bao by Kaya, the fried chicken sammich from Bob White's, and chicken quesadillas from Dorado's (we were hungry). We also had a Trappizino which has since closed and been replaced by Zai Lai (!!!). Great place to pass time with a large group of friends without worrying about a resto that caters to everyone's appetite. 

Went back again recently for Zai Lai's grand opening ($2 bowls!) and loooooved the minced pork. The chicken was okay - nothing stood out. Pork buns were amazing (but saw a sign today that they are no longer serving???). Can't wait to try the beef noodle soup. So happy I no longer need to make the trek to Columbus Circle for some of their goodness - albeit with a more limited menu. 

Can you tell I'm a fan??"
1038,urbanspace-at-570-lex-new-york,2018-04-06,4.0,"Food courts seem to be the hottest thing right now, and this Urbanspace location on Lex is one of its latest offerings. I've not been to any of the other Urbanspaces but this one was something that I liked.

We stopped by on a Thursday to pick up a quick lunch, and the place was crowded but not as packed as the reviews had me think it would be. Perhaps it was because of the April snow shower we had that morning (yay climate change?)

The first sense I had was of confusion. So many options and I could only pick one! I finally decided to try out the bao by kaya stand, and went for the 2 bao + cold noodles combo. I picked thai chicken and pork buns (they were unfortunately out of the duck I wanted to try). I don't say this often but the chicken was better than the pork - much more flavorful while the pork belly one was tender and juicy but could have done with more sauce. The cold sesame noodles were quite good as well. They have a good bit of seating on the upper level so we had our food there rather than trudging back in the snow. 

Prices didn't seem to bad, a tad higher than midtown rates but nothing outrageous. There's a lot of great counters here so although its a bit far from my workplace, I will be back to try out a couple more things here."

Anxiously took it back to my desk to have my lunch (short 3min walk). When I arrived I came to the sad realization how dry this was and it didn't end there. At no point did they say/ask if I wanted it to be spicy, so when mixed the noodles with the peanuts and the chili flakes the heat was beyond anything enjoyable (though my heat tolerance is high to begin with). I tried to tough it up and get through my $15 meal, however even the chicken was so dry! The overall meal was tasteless, overly spicy, greasy, and way over cocked. It was so bad I ended up throwing almost all of it out. #neveragain"

Bagels are the main thing here. It has a pretty large menu. The menu is pretty typical. It's about $5 for a bagel and a spread. They have a pretty large variety. A few other menu items include sandwiches, if you don't want a bagel. The last time here I came with my smoking hot friend. I had a poppyseed bagel with the tofu vegan cream cheese. She had a sesame bagel with the same spread on it. The bagels were okay but they were kind of stale. 

I might decide to come back. It didn't really impress us at all. The restroom always is out of order which is the most annoying thing."

I tend to get the the avocado breakfast sandwich with egg whites. I like it because it's exactly as you expect and doesn't come with any unnecessary sides. My husband often gets various breakfast sandwiches and likes it too. Gotham has coffee but it's not the best so I tend to skip getting it from there. 

There's a nice seating area that you can utilize after you order at the counter. They bring you your food and it's usually pretty quick. Many of the seats have outlets near them so you will see people working sometimes.

1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2018-01-20,3.0,"Back when I used to live around the corner, I scoured this neighborhood from top to bottom looking for cafes with seating. One of the key categories missing from this neck of the woods is somewhere with guaranteed seating, lightning-fast WiFi, and tasty pastries. Well, Gotham boasts the seating part. I've never had to wait for a table to open up, even on the busiest of Sunday mornings. WiFi is a little on the fritz: you have to toggle it on and off a few times. 

Let's talk about the food. Everything has been uniformly served on the cold side, temperature-wise. Maybe it's an issue with staffing, such that food gets left out and forgotten for a few minutes before being brought to the table. And I suppose it's a good thing I've never had to choke back a scalding mouthful of soup but, particularly in the winter time, food served piping hot should be the standard. 

The pressed paninis are quite small - I don't have the biggest appetite in the world but I scarfed mine down and could have easily fit in another. Besides, paninis are like half of a real sandwich anyway. 

I do like their breakfast offerings. Their egg, Swiss, and tomato on a toasted everything bagel is a thing of simple beauty. Don't miss their croissant sandwiches, though I would ask them to leave the croissant in the toaster for a few extra seconds. 

As for the service, all my interactions have been pleasant, even bordering on friendly, though I will say that everyone, from the smoothie operator to the sandwich-maker, looks perpetually confused."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2019-02-12,5.0,"Gotham Cafe has been my go-to spot in the Upper East Side for the past 8 years. This place has everything that a classic NYC cafe should have. Their breakfast options extend from your traditional bagel with cream cheese and lox, to delicious breakfast platers and of course, avocado toast. They have really great coffee and quick staff. For dining-in orders, they give you a numbered ticket and they deliver your food to you. They have great pre-made options too for a quick bit on-the-go."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2018-01-05,1.0,"I've been coming here for years. I work across the street and I like their strong coffee. However, today I found a STAPLE in my flat-everything bagel with butter. Luckily I separated the halves as I took a bite and noticed it! I politely pulled the manager aside and showed him the bagel and he immediately said it must be the bakery's fault and he'll be sure to speak with them. I explained that it was cut open, toasted and then smeared with butter, with the staple laying on top. (Highly unlikely to have been baked in) He offered me a new bagel and explained his normal staff was out sick. 

I'm not looking for a handout, just take responsibility, apologize and offer at least a refund! When I asked for a refund he said ""Don't worry, I'll give you a new one tomorrow!"" 

SMH..."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2019-03-19,1.0,I found the best sandwich. The Gouda Melt. I love it. I have come and gotten it several times.  But the service I have received the last several times is appalling.  The manager is aggressive and excessively overcharges for or any change in your order and will charge you for ice. A couple of the employees are rude and the others look afraid. I will not be retuening to this establishment ever. You would be better off at any other deli or coffe shop in the city.
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2017-11-21,5.0,"A pretty busy cafe in UES where the prices are typical Manhattan prices. The food is delicious though. The space is larger than your typical NYC coffee shop. The cafe also has wifi, but it was kind of slow at times. There are a lot of menu items, but I can speak for the avocado & boiled egg toast. I requested for my avocado & boiled egg to be on a croissant instead of toast. Salt & pepper was lightly sprinkled over my croissant, which was the little touch that it needed to be delicious! My only con is that the boiled egg was cold [I'm sure it was refrigerated] & since it's cold in NYC, I would have preferred the eggs to also be warm - maybe they can add this as an option since the croissant is already warm as well. Either way, I'll give this place 5 stars."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2019-08-02,5.0,"I love Gotham! I come here at least once a week. I have yet to find avocado toast as good as the one here. Five stars, highly recommend!"
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2019-05-04,3.0,"This is a great spot to stop for a quick coffee and meal. The espresso is excellent, and their lattes are up to par. As for food, I have only had the lox deluxe bagels, so I can't speak for anything else. But the lox bagels are DELICIOUS! 

As for staff, some improvement would be nice. The cashier never looks me in the eye or even speaks at all. I get it, it's New York, baby, but come on. Regardless, I'll be back."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2018-11-06,1.0,"I don't like to write reviews like this, but the food is mediocre and overpriced, and the manager's got a mean attitude towards customers. I have been coming here for YEARS even though the food's not great--it's right next to a client of mine so I often stop by for breakfast anyways when I'm on the go. I'm usually happy to support a neighborhood cafe, even if their food is less than spectacular.

The other day they took 20 minutes to prepare an $11 bagel sandwich. (Fine, it was a busy day...it happens...though they're often slow even when it's not busy.) When I took out the sandwich to eat it later, it wasn't even the right bagel and it wasn't prepared as I had ordered. For $11 I wasn't having that, but I didn't have time to go back at all let alone wait another 20. 

When I went back the next day it was much quieter, but they said I should have brought a receipt (which they hadn't even offered me when I got my sandwich, but I didn't think anything of it at the time) and they couldn't do anything. I said ""after my years of coming here, you must recognize my face as a regular supporter of your business? I'd just like to get what I paid for.""

The manager's response was ""I see 1200 customers, I don't know you and I can't do anything for you.""

This is a neighborhood place that I'm guessing relies on its regulars, but I'd rather go out of my way to eat better tasting and more sanely priced food without attitude. (Honestly, if he'd even been polite in declining to take responsibility for his employees' f*ckup I would have been frustrated but gotten over it.) 

TLDR: The bagels are dry and only good if you get something on them that distracts you from the subpar taste, but worse still I believe you can taste the manager's attitude in your food. 

You'll get better vibes, better food, better prices, and better service at any of the many other nearby options."

1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2018-11-17,2.0,"Gotham has good coffee. And a nice space. 

So you go to Gotham. You go to Gotham, and you put up with the wrong orders, the shitty attitudes of the people who work there, the tables that often haven't been cleared or cleaned. You pay $9.00 for a breakfast sandwich they get wrong, and then you take shit off the woman you try to explain this to. You question whether she thinks you made the sandwich yourself.

I stopped drinking coffee. Not sure I'll keep going to Gotham."

But recently every single time I come in the lady at the register is incredibly rude. Today I ordered a simple breakfast and when asked what bread I wanted I said ""no bread"" and she flipped out and raised her voice with an annoyed tone asking ""well how do you want it!!??"" I could only stare at her I was so taken aback by her reaction. Then she asked if I wanted to go or to stay and I clearly said to stay. When my food was ready they tossed a to go bag onto my table. Awful service all around. I get that businesses get busy and maybe she was in a bad mood but it was very rude in my opinion to lash out over wanting no bread and sliced tomatoes (which apparently was so difficult to order so I ended up with tomatoes in my omelet!)"
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2018-06-16,3.0,"Wanted to find a place with seating for studying and this definitely checked that box. However, I tried 3 outlets and all of them didn't work.

1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2016-10-15,3.0,"Been trying to find a coffee shop to study in and thought I'd try this place. Coffee was meh -- definitely had better. Wifi was fast and free. Tons of seating, like TONS -- probably enough to fit about 30 people comfortably in the shop.

But downsides is that there is one bathroom and I was waiting for like 15-20 minutes for this person to get out of the bathroom and then I gave up and ran home. Tables are tiny, which wasn't the best for studying purposes. Chairs are not very comfortable. Decor is okay, I guess. Not a place that I want to study in again, though, just because it wasn't very cozy. It felt kind of cold, if that makes sense."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2017-11-03,3.0,"I like the atmosphere and the free wi-fi - though it wasn't really working this time. They have a good variety of good.

1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2019-02-12,3.0,"Went in this little nondescript cafe one late afternoon to kill time. I ordered mocha and have to say it was one of the better tasting mochas I've had around town. Prices comparable. They have a lot more tables than your typical tiny cafes. The place is high ceilinged so even though decor inside gives an antique ambience, it feels airy and not stifling and I'd say comfortable enough for work or chatting purposes. Minuses...I feel theyve got to improve lighting and have their restroom repaired. I do see myself going back when around the area."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2018-05-14,4.0,"I fairly enjoy this cafe on a day that I want to splurge a little. They offer everything a normal cafe would offer such as, soup, salad, sandwiches, coffee and beverages, smoothies, pastries, etc. One thing I do want to point out: their unique soups. Today I had coconut curry chicken and it was extremely good! I recommend this and the vegetarian lentil!"
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2016-05-24,4.0,"Nice coffee house with plenty of seating and wifi. It reminds me of the days of yore when coffee houses were young. Now they are either small, have no wifi or are Starbucks. I will be coming here more in the hopes that it will continue in this vein.

Shocked at all the reviews of poor customer service, as I have never had a negative encounter; everyone who works there has been exceedingly nice and helpful. They have an awesome assortment of really good pastries, and the bagels and sandwiches I've tried have always been great. I'd keep going back for the great coffee alone, but I love that its so quaint and quintessentially New York inside. All around, highly recommend this place."

1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2014-07-21,3.0,"This is a local place and they come in and settle in.  Go for it.

The bagels are stacked, so don't be surprised if your plain bagel tastes something like an everything bagel.

It is small, but I heard it is much larger than the original which was really more of just a coffee shop.  Service was okay, water was only room temperature in a miniscule cup.  It really was just okay, nothing special."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2018-03-28,5.0,"NOTE: I started a Yelp account just so I could publicly say how much I love this place.

I work in the area and the lunch/coffee options are tricky. I find it's either fast food with no seating or pricey waiter service. Sometimes you just need to escape the office and find a quiet place to decompress. And that isn't as easy as one might think. Especially in the winter. This place is the answer, though! I wandered in one chilly fall day and found they had pumpkin pie for sale by the slice. That alone was enough to win me over.

The atmosphere is sort of old school NYC coffee shop with a shabby chic Euro twist. Spots like this are virtually extinct in New York. Gone are the days when one could linger over a warm beverage and read a book, or write, or check email. But Gotham is perfect for exactly that. It's roomy and there seems to always be seating when I go.

Anytime I'm having a bad day, I can come here and restore my sanity with a bowl soul warming soup (served in real crockery!) and fresh bread. It's one of my favorite places. 

Extra points for stocking Polar Seltzer."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2014-06-19,3.0,"I like this place. it's not terrible and it's pretty cheap! it's not exactly deserving of 4 stars just because I think the food can still improve. the frontega chicken panini was pretty flavorful but lacked a bit of moisture. the chicken was a little on the drier side but it was still tasty and it was a big portion. they cut it in 4 pieces so it looks like it's piled on the plate. it had it's high moments with the pesto spread and the mozzarella cheese though. my brother had the special of the day which was a philly cheesesteak which didn't look like a cheesesteak by any means. it really just looked like meat in between bread but it smelled good and my brother liked it.

this is definitely a meeting spot for new moms though because at lunch time the strollers PACK the restaurant. which is a little annoying but that's the upper east side for you. entitled new moms who think their double strollers deserve a place in the middle of the cafe where it's most inconvenient. 

the actual cafe was cute and just a good meeting spot in general to grab lunch and chill. I'd probably come back here again to try the rest of their sandwiches."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2016-08-07,5.0,"Gotham is a popular neighborhood place with a very friendly atmosphere.  We have found the best coffee in NYC so far!  I had the vanilla slim latte and my husband had the Carmel macchiato. The power breakfast bagel was delish. Definitely will come back and highly recommend you try it. 

We returned on a Saturday morning. This rustic neighborhood place was busy with locals including families. We loved the toasted bagel and cinnamon cigar pastry. Impressive that the cashier/owner? remembered us. After only one visit.  They have great possibilities for lunch..."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2017-09-06,5.0,"It's a spot for us to have breakfast. You don't need anything complicated in a workday morning: a toasted everything bagel and a cup of coffee. I always enjoy the bagel here better than begal works since I like the crispy outside and soft inside. Efficient staff and easy going amsphere, I don't ask too much from a neighborhood cafe. I am satisfied and happy every time I leave here. That's all."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2018-01-27,5.0,"LOVE GOTHAM!

1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2017-09-17,3.0,"Decent place to get a quick ok meal. The sandwiches are ok, tend to be on the dry side. The soups are usually pretty good and are made in house. Coffee is ok, not great. Typically you can find a place to sit, but possibly the worst thing about this place is that there is very poor ventilation and even if you just stay for 10-20 minutes you end up smelling like a greasy pressed panini. This a serious turn-off and often prevents me from going there."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2016-01-26,4.0,"I've been here a few times and really enjoyed it. I like their thin style bagels and their paninis are great. Last time had the Chipotle Chicken Panini. It was delicious! I had half immediately and reheated the other half 2 days later and it still tasted great! 
I would not recommend coming here if your in a hurry. Everything is prepared after you order it so it takes a little while to get your food."
1039,gotham-cafe-new-york,2017-10-20,5.0,"Great breakfast spot. The place is always full of families with their little kids, and there are usually a couple of dogs tied up outside to pet.

I can't remember my cashiers name but she was at the register near the mobile pick up, && I when i placed my order she recommended my usual drink with a twist to it that she prefers && honestly, im glad i went with her recommendation! It was the passion tea lemonade with raspberry, better than my usual. I was skeptical at first but it was worth it.

Working in that building and being one of the regular customers, I've had many experiences here, bad and somewhat mediocre. The lines around 9-10am are always super long, so prepare.

Oftentimes, they run out of the more popular breakfast items like ham and Swiss croissant. 

One black, short female cashier always wearing a black beaming is exceptionally mean and unprofessional. Seeing her serve customers nothing but negative attitude makes me glad I no longer frequent this location."

Occasionally they'll be out of something (per the app since I almost always order ahead), and in those cases I'll hit up another nearby Starbuck's if I'm set on whatever drink but for the most part I always order here.
There is a decent amount of seating too if you need to hangout for a bit.
I think their 2.5 star review is a bit low, so I'm aiming a bit higher at 4 stars to help these guys out. They work hard!"

He manages to remember the name of every repeat customer. AND their order. For a midtown Starbucks that must be thousands of customers a week. And he's nice. Every time. 

In a hard world, in a hard city, where we're all just trying to do our best, Jay is delivering his best. So, thanks Jay! And see you next time."
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2019-09-30,4.0,"Disclaimer: here during breakfast hours.

So I frequent here before work to grab at least something to drink to get my day started. It's a pretty spacious spot with a bunch of seating, a few armchairs, and seems to be sufficiently staffed on each occasion that I have been there. It's pretty clean inside and there's the selection of coffee and tea and food that is standard for every location.

As of the drink and food, I haven't had one poorly made drink yet! I had the pumpkin cream cold brew (seasonal item) and the pink drink. I will say that they do tend to run out of some ingredients so ask first before ordering.

I will say though, every time I leave this Starbucks I smell like cigarettes. I don't smoke! So maybe there is something that can be adjusted in their policy to keep any smokers away from the little nook at the entrance of the location. If I find that the source comes from somewhere else on my commute to work then I will adjust this review. 

Other than that, pretty good Starbucks spot in this part of the city."

Had Carmel and chestnut latte, nothing else. Service was fast but, no seating place filled with tourists and crowded, since close to grand central.

I really go to any fast-casual establishment in Manhattan with low expectations, but this one just doesn't even hit those standards. Pretty sure they employ sloths, but I also think I've seen sloths move quicker and with more of a sense of urgency than the employees here. If you mobile order, plan to order a half hour ahead. Yes, even for black coffee. 42nd/Park or 42nd/2nd. Both a block away and much better, more accurate service."

She replied that she would buy something after she went used the restroom. Like come on.

Also, they're super cheap with the refills and give you the third degree. I guess they have to be strict because they're close to GCT. Good to know that there's a restroom and outlets here if you're in the area and need to work or kill time."

The workers here seem more frazzled and less friendly.  One particular worker also has made the same mistake multiple times so maybe the training needs to be improved.

Also want to mention, that they don't keep accurate inventory here so when you order something it's very possible (happens to me often) that the item isn't available.  So, you end up not only wasting your time but possibly not getting what you wanted."

For hot and iced coffee (and iced tea) it should be good to go by the time you go up to pay.  For fancier beverage choices, you'll still have to wait sometimes.

At any normal time of day, there is plenty of seating - but not so much during the morning rush.  That's ok - i'm not there to sit, and you probably aren't either unless you are working from Starbucks or are making a touristy pit stop.

Most importantly - despite the rush and chaos, my drinks are ALWAYS correct.  Everyone that works there seems to know what they are doing, which is lovely when serving thousands of routinely impatient people on a daily basis."
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2016-01-18,3.0,It's a large Starbucks with plenty of seating. I came across this location because some buses pick up right around here. The service was fast and friendly. The coffee and breakfast sandwiches were standard. The egg and cheese sandwich was $3 and came hot. I love the convenience.
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2016-07-16,1.0,"Slowest service ever. Only one person was in line in front of me and I still waited almost ten minutes and was never greeted nor acknowledged by the staff. Ended up having to leave without coffee since I only budgeted 10 mins for the trip. I can only imagine how long I would have waited if I'd ordered. 
Order ahead or be prepared to wait."
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2017-09-06,1.0,One of the worst Starbucks I have been to. It has not even reached 8am and the employees are already being obnoxiously loud and using profanity in front of the customers. Also playng music with profanity in it. This is Statbucks not a trap house. My coffee for the first time ever tastes like dirty water! I would walk out of my way not to come back here again.
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2015-06-27,5.0,"Ok, so there's usually not much to say about a Starbucks. I mean... It's Starbucks, you know what you're getting. But something about this place...
Not sure if it was how clean and organized and spacious it was, or just how downright nice every single employee seemed to be. I'm talking eye contact, a smile, a ""how are you"" that almost convinced me they cared.

Bravo!"
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2016-02-20,1.0,"I know it's Starbucks so it's like, hey what do you expect, but this is honestly the worst one I've walked in to.  I've gone in on two separate occasions and will never again.  If you go, prepare to be ignored while the staff talks to each other, be prepared for your order to get screwed up, and be prepared to be given the look of death and major attitude when you ask them to fix it."
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2015-10-07,2.0,"This isn't one of the best Starbucks I've been to, but it is extremely convenient because it's attached to my office building. So during the day I don't really have much of a choice. It's a very large location and it's in a very central area being in one of the most popular work neighborhoods in Manhattan. 

The drinks here are very inconsistent. Sometimes they'll be great and other times they'll just be  ok. The line is always so long even if it isn't peak hours. The workers are friendly! The best solution for this location would be to hire more help. If they had more employees here, I believe that would solve a majority of the issues. I go here by default, but would rather visit a Starbucks that offers consistent drinks and a less hectic environment."
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2015-01-06,4.0,"My usual Starbucks. 

*Despite the location and early morning crowds, they almost never mess up on my order. 
*If the line is at the end of the counter, it's not bad. If it curls around the entrance, I usually give in to the coffee machine at work. 
*The one time that they really messed up on my order, I called from my office and they had a new drink ready by the time I got there. 
*My old usual Starbucks is nearby... and they were somewhat nasty. The people here are super nice!

Props for a Starbucks of this size in tourist central to be able to serve with a smile.

The only thing that annoys me is occasionally there are groups of young office workers who like to stand and talk near the cashiers/pickup area - the area is tight enough with space - if you got your drink, move on!"
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2017-12-13,1.0,"I have a video of how loud the dub step music was this day:  I was at this Starbucks on 42nd between Lex and 3rd Ave. and the new shift comes in around 1pm. They proceed to put on some crazy dubstep/rap music over the sound system, and it is blasting, chasing out all of the customers. I asked them if they could change the music to regular Starbucks music because I couldn't think and it was hard to hear the person I was there with, but they ignored me. About 5 minutes later I asked again and questioned if management would approve of such behavior, then one of the employees, perhaps the manager, idk, started arguing with me.  I was being respectful, but when she kept arguing with me I finally said ""You gotta be f'ing kidding me"".  With that she accused me of cussing her out, then said that if I had asked more polity she probably would have turned the music down. More polite? lol, okay. I guess she's psychic as well as psycho. How do people like this still have a job? My friend and I were the last customers to leave.  I suppose that's what they wanted, 1pm on a Saturday.   I wish I could post the video here because it's pretty hilarious how loud and crazy it was."
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2016-10-20,1.0,How could anyone mess up a coffee... This place did.  Avoid Antonio and what else can I say... I'm sorry to give Starbucks one star because generally I'm a five-star Starbucks guy but avoid this Starbucks and go somewhere else
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2018-05-26,4.0,"this starbucks on 42nd st off lexington ave is a mad crowded place during the week with the morning rush and it's proximity to grand central terminal but on a saturday morning it's a different story and it's where i am at for a decaff cappy and lemon pound cake slice .place with its  modern semi upscale design is fairly spacious with tables , chairs and counter space to enjoy your morning cup and wifi . the large glass counter has a good amount of sweets and other decent eats which starbucks is known for with the hot and cold beverages getting top billing . you can charge up quickly with plenty of outlets all around the place but the starbucks brands  for sale takes up too much space , cant recall how many times i have bumped into or knocked over mugs or bags of coffee , maybe on a shelve behind the counter would be a good move or have all the stuff in one section away from all the people movement . did enjoy my drink and pound cake especially with not too many folks around . place looks fairly clean and condiment counter is well stocked and the starbucks workers seemed ok during my visit . me personally not a place i would visit  during the morning weekday rush unless you like waiting on long lines ."
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2014-03-19,3.0,"Kinda like this location, but I wish they had more baristas on duty during the morning rush hours. The line is always, always around the corner, but I must say the service is always superb. No error on your order and name is spelled correctly. That's a total plus! The place is clean and the display always full, not sure how they do it, considering there's always 2 or 3 baristas on duty at a time. Starbucks the only place on earth that has made it socially acceptable to pay $5 bucks for a cup of coffee or tea. Go figure!!!!"
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2017-08-18,2.0,"I get my morning coffee here every day, and will continue to do so.  However, I need to stop ordering my breakfast at this location.  For some reason, the person heating up the breakfast sandwiches likes to clump certain orders together and doesn't prepare them in the order in which the stickers come out on the machine.  That may work well for her.   However, I just waited 10 minutes for a sandwich.  That is unacceptable in NYC when I can literally get a bacon/egg/cheese sandwich on any corner in less than 2 minutes.  Love your bacon, gouda, egg sandwiches, but i can't afford to give up 10 minutes of my morning."
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2016-07-05,1.0,"Terrible! I had to make this review because of how unpleasant this Starbucks is. You would think a Starbucks next to business buildings would make the quality of service even better but this is by far the WORST Starbucks I have been in my ENTIRE LIFE: I first ordered a light ice latte AND a cup of water. They end up making a light ice BLACK coffee. After they realized they messed up, the end up filling the cup that's supposed to be WATER with latte and regular ice (I want light). And gave me NO water in the end. Cashier even asked me to come back to the register to pay again.....which I already did! I am a loyal Starbucks customer but I can't be any more disappointed with this experience..."
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2011-08-25,3.0,"This is the closest Starbuck's to my work place (there are actually about five insanely enough).  I visit now and then and found it has improved greatly over time.  Several months ago I would have given it two stars, but recently they've opened up the space more and added some seats and a large table for laptop users.

One thing I'll say for this store is that it's larger than your average hole-in-the-wall Starbucks.  The space goes deep into the building and is rather wide, with most of the seating set up as small tables with two chairs.  The store is kept clean and appears well taken care of.

The staff is very courteous and friendly.  I've never seen them take very long to make a drink even when it's crowded.  They definitely have a good system worked out.

This place does get super crowded most of the time as its audience combines tourists, office workers and students in one big mash.  Be warned, there are times when the line could go out the door."
1040,starbucks-new-york-441,2014-12-19,3.0,"Typical Starbucks location with all the usual. It is a madhouse from about 8:30-9:15 or so. There are usually close to 20 people waiting in line. They are pretty quick, but I think they could be even more efficient. They have 1 person making the drinks. Everyone else looks busy but they make quick things like the black coffee. Be prepared to wait if you order something fancy. I used to also get the spinach feta wrap which is pretty good. However recently it's been super soggy even when I get it toasted 2x! I think it arrives frozen in the morning so when cooked the spinach gets soggy.

They have a pretty big seating area so that's nice if you need to use the wifi and stay awhile. Bathroom is pretty clean too."
1041,dan-jones-new-york,2020-06-10,5.0,"This place is just tooooo cute!! Usually I stop in for a cold brew to go, and it's quite lovely. Super aesthetic shop with minimal seating, but people definitely like lounging here on the weekends with a friend or two for an intimate catch up sesh."
1041,dan-jones-new-york,2020-01-25,4.0,"Cute, tiny coffeeshop that makes the most of it's space. Beautiful ceiling and a surprising amount of tables packed in. 

The pastries are eye-catching and wide ranging. The special cookies and caneles caught our eye. We were curious about the draft latte (a foamy cold brew concoction) and they kindly let us try some - it tasted delicious. 

I ended up ordering a decaf cortado oat milk, which was beautiful. Either the oat milk or espresso had a very bitter flavor though, and it was hard to taste the coffee itself. Overall, a solid cortado but not for my personal taste."
1041,dan-jones-new-york,2020-01-06,3.0,"I had so-so memories of this space from when it used to be a really mediocre juice and salad shop, and had meh hopes that it would turn out to be a good coffee shop. Well, the coffee is sharp and strong and does the trick of keeping me relatively bright-eyed but, as other reviews have alluded to, the vibes put out by the front counter are not always the friendliest. I've come when it's empty and I've come when there's a line and almost always, I can count on a scowl or the absolute bar minimum for human interactions. Or they're too busy checking their phones, bopping to the music or chatting with each other.

Which sucks because to my knowledge, Dan Jones is the only place relatively close by that offers: 
1) This cheesy scone that I always regret a smidgen because eating it feels like swallowing a brick whole but it tastes so, so good. Especially when you brave a grumble and they toast it for you. 
2) Some sort of sticky pecan bun that I like to have with a latte for the best afternoon pick me up. 

On the other end of the spectrum, I've had the brownest avocado toast here that I've ever seen. I'm not above eating a super brown avocado out of its skin crouched over my garbage bin but I definitely would think twice before serving it to someone else. 

Maybe I'm just coming by on off days but that said ... I do come by a lot."
1041,dan-jones-new-york,2020-01-05,5.0,"Fast, really friendly, great food! The vegan toast was so flavorful and the canele was perfectly caramelized on the outside and spongy on the inside."

One of those places where staff feel that they are cool than cool because they work in a coffee shop.

Just don't go."

Me: hey, can I get an americano and black coffee?
Barista: (sassy tone) GOOD MORNING! How about we start with that?!?
Me: uh okay...
Barista: you want a container for that?
Me: huh?
Barista: do you need something to hold your coffees?
Me: no

*walks out with coffee thinking what a dbag*

I was going to write a poor review right then and there but the stores yelp site wasn't up yet. 

Such a shame because I drink coffee everyday and I live in the same building as this shop. Im going to stick with getting my coffee @ Madame Sousou Cafe

TL;DR: come here for coffee with a side of attitude..."

Overall, a great addition to the neighborhood!"
1041,dan-jones-new-york,2019-05-19,5.0,"One of my favorite coffee shops in NYC. It may be small, but the people and coffee make up for it! Love their iced oat latte or cold brew. And their bagels are really good. Definitely check it out if you're in the area!!!"

I went here to drink a good coffee with my wife and I was absolutely satisfied with everything they had to offer. The service was very nice and the staff are really friendly. The interior design is very beautiful! And the food doesn't fall behind at all. I had a Cappuccino and it was just perfect. 

I would definitely come back and recommend them!"

I go at least 2-3 times a week to get my coffee fix, keep up the good work Dan Jones!"
1041,dan-jones-new-york,2019-05-02,5.0,I came here for the first time and noticed that one of the best baristas in NY was behind the counter. The long trip was totally worth it. Great coffee and beautiful space
1041,dan-jones-new-york,2019-11-05,1.0,Will be closed in a month. 10 minutes to put butter on a bagel. While I waited I sipped on my lukewarm flavorless coffee. Head here if you can take 3 hour coffee break and have no regard for your money.
1041,dan-jones-new-york,2019-09-12,4.0,"I can't speak to the coffee as I haven't had I'd yet but I think their meal pal lunches are fantastic. Really good sandwiches with extremely high quality bread as well as out of this world vegan and avocado toast.

I was on my way to Starbucks when one of my colleagues hands me a small token to go check out Dan Jones, and get a coffee -  I was super excited to stop by this morning, I've had Colombe coffee before and it's incredible - but c'mon it's coffee! and Starbucks is right around the corner.

I complete my order, was first one in line, and ordered a latte and an egg sandwich (which was +$9). While chatting with my friend, I saw a cup ready to go and I go to grab it - all of the sudden one of the man behind the counter yells at me and with a very sassy and rude tone yells: ""DON'T TAKE THAT, THAT'S NOT YOUR COFFEE"". I proceed to keep talking to my friend, and he prepares two other drinks (keep in mind I was the first one to order and I asked for a latte, how hard to make is that!?). The third cup he sits on the counter, seemed like a latte and since 3 people had already gone before me, and I heard latte - I pick that one up. He goes crazy on me and yells at me ""MA'M THAT'S NOT YOUR COFFEE DON'T TAKE THAT, YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION!"" Really!? where am I, why are you talking to me like that and who the hell does he think he is to speak to customers that way? I asked him to take a step back and not speak to me that way, and he continued to argue, and say that he had ""TOLD ME 3 TIMES NOT TO TAKE THAT!"" okay, tell me a 4th,5th, and 6th time dude, I'm the customer, why are you even taking so long to make a LATTE! 

I was so disappointed, he was so rude, and aggressive, I asked to cancel my order. And I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN THERE AGAIN. NEVER!"

1041,dan-jones-new-york,2019-05-18,5.0,Great place to grab some food and coffee. The avocado toast was fresh and made with some passion. I heard that a well-known barista worked there and he was ultimately there making my toast. I asked if he could pls make me any coffee... Coffee was NICE (especially after he asked me what I usually drank for coffee so that he could make me something he thought I'd like). I mean NICE as a Saturday morning in May. Cashier was cool too. The Glory by Kanye was playing in the background... so I'll be back based on the mix of good things this spot offers

I know I make mistakes, maybe I forgot to say iced, so I asked if I could make it iced then. She said ""uh no.""
???
I offered to pay the difference if there was in price? She said no you can do that. They were the same price, $4.99. They had not started making it. I have no idea why it couldn't be iced. Call me a child but I don't like hot coffee! I'm going. To Starbucks next time."

So if you want to sit I suggest you split up with your friend- one of you go to the counter to order while the other holds down a seat or hovers impatiently over people for a seat. There are about 6 tables for two people, and a n area before the tables with four seats and a bar to eat on. The rest of the store is more spacious. The staff is very nice and attentive, but I would say they could come over to the dining area and clean a bit more.
Food: The sandwich- cheese, lettuce, tomato, and red onions was fresh and tasty. The drink was their blood orange sparkling beverage  which was quite tasty and not too tart. 
Location: right near the C & E trains and close to the theatre district. 

Overall, I enjoyed what I had and Pret is always a good guilt free meal. I wish they would get heavy cream for their coffee and then maybe I would divorce Starbucks."

WHY IS THE MUSIC SO LOUD?!?!
I've been in bars with lower music. Jesus.

The large cappuccino was meh. So much weird dishwater suds foam. 

There is seating in the back, so that's not too shabby. And get your receipt if you want to use the wi-fi. You'll need the code. There is a LinkNYC kiosk in front of the store, but the reception gets iffy when you go to the back. 
There's a restroom as well. You'll need your receipt for that as well. 

This location would have been conducive to getting work done if not for the bloody loud music."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2019-06-11,1.0,"Truly gross. The frittata is bad cafeteria eggs with a few veggies floating on top. No sign of the promised feta cheese. 

The one time I ordered a sandwich it was a similar experience. Days-old bread with bad lunch meat in between. Go to McDonald's. It's gourmet by comparison."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2019-04-11,4.0,"I've loved Pret since I lived in London, UK. Pret in the states is not as delicious as the ones back in UK but I still love their bread, sandwiches, juices, and salad. 

Pro:
- healthy selection 
- good pastries as well 

Con:
- this location seems a bit small; few seating area 
- some items are expensive"
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2017-03-07,4.0,"I don't want to Pret-end that I like chains, but the shocker is, I do actually like the sandwiches at Pret-A-Manger. They taste almost fairly fresh, and they have some pretty good, stacked, well-put-together items. They definitely taste fresher and more wholesome than most places that sell pre-made sandwiches, for sure. Although the words pre-made in themselves are off-putting to myself.

What I also like about Pret-A-Manger is that at the end of each business day, they supposedly give all of their sandwiches away to the homeless. Thanks to Alex K for letting me know about that. However I'm not sure how you would get a hold of said sandwiches, as I've been homeless in my lifetime and was unaware of such delights.

Anyway I'm going to stop giving you reason to think I'm pret-entious."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2018-08-12,3.0,"This place is a hit or miss. Sometimes the food is okay and sometimes it's bad. For example, the egg sandwich sometimes have runny eggs and burnt bacon and sometimes the bacon is undercooked. Plus they are very stingy with the bacon all the time. 

The service is also similar. Sometimes you get a friendly cashier and sometimes you get someone who is totally obnoxiously rude. However, almost all the time half the seats are taken up by people who work there the other half by either teenagers or tourists. Basically don't expect to get a seat if you come here; just get take out..."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2018-10-16,3.0,"As far as chains go, Pret is one of the top ones. This Pret is on the smaller side, so you will have trouble finding seats, especially if it's around showtime. There are a couple tables in the back, and a few seats by the wall up front. You need a code from your receipt for the bathroom, which is one single room, so if there's lots of tourists around, good luck getting the chance to use it. They're open late, and even if you go in late, they have a relatively full stock. I tried the turkey chilli and an almond milk cappuccino; the turkey chilli at Pret is alright, definitely soothes your soul if it's cold outside, but I wish there was more turkey in it. The cappuccino was delightful. If you have the app, you'll get ""treats,"" and one of them during the fall includes getting a free beverage if you purchase a fall item FYI, so download the app! Service at this location is solid; once, I went in before a show and casually mentioned to one of the employees that I'd be back after a show I was catching and that I wanted one of their soups, and she said she'd hold it for me to make sure it wasn't gone by the time I returned - so thoughtful of her!"
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2018-02-11,4.0,"I must say I have passed these stores often while in NYC. I have actually been quite curious and while I prefer sit down full service restaurants, the food here was good. The service was good and staff was very helpful. 

I had the chicken salad with avocado. The salad was fresh and good. There was a huge variety of salad dressings. The salad was huge and the price was reasonable. This fast casual spot is somewhere to get a healthy and quick meal. I had a taste for something sweet and got a greek yogurt with apples, cinnamon, and granola. It was delicious! Staff was very helpful when I inquired as to whether the granola had raisins or cranberries, as I despise raisins. The staff person that assisted me was very helpful. He want to the kitchen and inquired as to how the granola is made and came back to let me know there were not raisins used in specific parfait I wanted. 

While this was not the normal sit down restaurant I am accustomed to supporting while in NYC, this was a pleasant surprise."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2018-04-20,1.0,"Bad croissants. The app scanning system needs improvement.
 
Don't don't try to redeem your free drink from the app here because they will charge you anyway. They suck."

1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2017-05-10,5.0,"I eat at Pret at least once a day for lunch, sometimes breakfast too and I'm never disappointed. This location is a tough one to work and visit because of all of the tourists - they are on vacation and the rest of us are hustling to work. 
Today, a woman cut in front of me in line and I said - excuse me I was next - she said no you're in a different line and put her stuff on the counter. I was clearly in front of her, but whatever. I let it go after saying - really? unreal. 
The Pret employee behind the register saw this and when I put my soup on the counter to pay she said, ""you don't have to pay for that,"" and gave me a wink and a smile. #karma
Thanks Pret! Every location has the best employees who truly care! I appreciate you all!"
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2018-11-29,5.0,Great spot in midtown for a quick lunch. Fairly crowded during lunch but quick and efficient service. Sandwiches are always very fresh and consistent. Great pastries as well! Friendly service and nice staff
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2016-01-12,4.0,"Stopped by this location while walking across the city. We had the chocolate chip cookie and a hot chocolate. The cookie was really good and I was happy with the purchase. The hot chocolate, not so much. At most it could have been classified as lukewarm chocolate. The service was average and the area where you put sugar and cream in your coffee was a bit disarrayed. I am sure that there are better locations of this business as I saw multiple scattered throughout the city. As for this one it is slightly above average."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2018-03-07,5.0,"Okay, once upon a time I gave this shop quite a low rating and after a while removed it from Yelp, simply because leaving a negative review is not my cup of tea. Luckily, management of this location seems to have looked into the issues I was addressing and have perfectly solved all the problems: sales associates and staff are now quite professional, polite, efficient and experienced. I wish them all the best of luck in their future careers. Despite the fact that the space is a bit tiny, it serves the purpose for me quite well whenever I'm in a bit of a hurry and need to grab a quick bite."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2017-08-15,4.0,"I like it. Usually just come for coffee. 

What I hate? The straws that are at a completely different station than milk, sugar, caps, stirrers, napkins and everything else you need. 
I felt like an idiot searching for straws. When the line is long, as is in the morning, the straw station is blocked.

My only silly complaint--easy fix!"
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2016-10-20,5.0,A place to eat healthy in a wasteland of terribly unhealthy choices. Thank you for being. Great happy employees !!!

The place is busy ...gives a feeling of being unkempt. The restrooms- HORRIBLE. That's why I've rated it as bad as I have."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2016-06-23,5.0,Nice and clean restaurant with friendly staff.  Just wanted a quick gluten-free snack - had the sweet pea hummus cup and it was great!
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2017-04-26,1.0,"I'm a regular Pret customer, or at least I was, but after visiting this location I think my patience with Pret is gone forever. The staff here was passive and less than friendly from the start, but when I asked multiple staff members to please turn down the volume level of the music in the back where I was sitting and trying to enjoy my coffee and a phone call, no one did anything to help. It was the loudest music I've ever heard in a cafe, it literally felt like a club. I asked twice to no avail. Then the temperature got progressively colder in the cafe; you could see uncomfortable customers putting on HATS AND GLOVES inside. I asked kindly again for something to be done and alas, no one on staff cared.

Pret's customer service standards are a joke. Food is consistently fine, but who wants to sit in an ice cave where the music is too loud for you to think and the staff doesn't care at all about whether or not you're comfortable? Bye Pret, I'm out."

1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2017-05-06,2.0,"I visit this particular store quite often since is very close to where I live, especially on my way to work Saturday mornings. I'm a reasonable person and I understand is early, but to Saturdays in a row, they had no breakfast sandwiches ready. The same team leader told me last week someone called out, understandable. This week, with a full staff, the excuse was that they make everything by hand. Really? Come on store manager, someone is not doing their job here! I like your food but your service at this particular store SUCKS!"
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2016-10-21,4.0,"So this review will be about Darnell the barista who took care of me Wed. night. All I wanted to find somewhere to sit,drink decaf coffee ,watch the debate on my phone with free wi fi and have a clean bathroom. The wi fi was initially spotty - but ending up being fine. What really impressed me was that when I mentioned to Darnell that the decaf was cold he happily offered me a decaf americano in its place.
That's the kind of attitude that should be everywhere. Well done.....BTW great Americano...."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2015-08-20,3.0,"This is a tiny little Pret with very limited seating. I was working nearby and came here pretty consistently for a month.  You likely will have to get takeaway if you come during the weekday lunchtime rush   I've been to better Pret's as far as Freshness, but during the weekday the food seems to be better than the weekend. I had a few Saturday lunchtime orders of the Avocado Veggie wrap that definitely tasted like they had been made the day before. 

Sadly, on one occasion  there was a hair inside one of my wrap's, which turned me off ""fast food"" for 48 hours or so, until I realized oh well it can happen anywhere I guess. 

The iced tea is consistently fresh, and the OJ Pret sells for a pretty penny is top of the line delicious!"

Organic coffee, breakfast, pastries, salads and fresh pressed juices!!! Amazingly good."

We come for the macaroons, absolutely delicious, I had them in many places but theirs are the best. They're carrying a bigger size too which allows you to taste more the creamy flavors inside but the small is still the well balanced version."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2017-02-02,1.0,"Why is this Pret location so ghetto? I feel like I'm back in my childhood in the Bronx. The music is too loud, the cashiers are too loud and their friends need to go. I haven't been in such a bad Pret ever. Won't be stopping in here again. It needs new management, new employees and less violent homeless people."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2016-04-03,4.0,"Like their chicken avocado salad. Very simple and healthy! I usually don't eat too many pastries (because I love them too much and I was worried that I can't control myself. ;) ). And I decided to get one of their croissants because they looked so delicious. I am not disappointed! Although, I wish I knew how to eat a croissant properly so I wouldn't get crumbs everywhere on my table and bag..."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2015-05-20,5.0,"I have been a fan of Pret for many years and enjoy their tag line: ""The best British Invasion since the Beatles"". I appreciate the freshness of the food and the cleanliness of their locations. 
I am particularly impressed with the staff of 825 8th Ave.--near Worldwide Plaza. Opening the store is often Sedrick at like 5:30am or earlier. Every morning he greets me with a smile and the display of freshly baked croissants and muffins look as good as they smell. 
In addition, I truly appreciate the genuine kindness and enthusiasm as well as patience and professionalism exemplified in Stephanie and Lee. 
I am rooting for a Pret closer to my office--Columbus Circle. Maybe some of my favorite Pret folks will come north a bit 
Seriously, THANK YOU to all the Pret employees and congrats to the manager for a great job in your hiring great people."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2016-09-29,1.0,The service here was absolutely shocking. The guy that served us started to make the other two servers coffee orders and people were called from the line to take their order without ours being finished. There are much better places to spend you cash in New York.
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2015-07-30,3.0,"We were nearby trying to win tickets at the Book of Mormon lottery, so we headed over to Pret A Manger to grab something cold to drink. They were out of green tea, which I thought was pretty weird for a coffeeshop, and I was kind of upset about it. I was probably overreacting and was really just hangry. Anyway, I ordered the raspberry black tea. It did the trick and as we were leaving, the guy behind the counter asked me how it was to make sure I liked what I ordered. That was really nice of him! There is a pretty small seating area towards the back of the restaurant, and they have a restroom in that area too."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2017-05-17,2.0,"Really inconsistent service, most mornings I have to huff it to another pret or get breakfast from another place because they don't have any egg sandwiches ready. Then during the afternoon their sandwich selection is very limited, it's like if you're lucky you'll get the sandwich you want, they either don't put them out or are really lazy about it. I guess I'll have to find another chain that's more consistent."
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2017-01-30,5.0,Everything was delicious always fresh tangerine juice goes great with any meal cashiers are fast
1042,pret-a-manger-new-york-42,2017-05-13,1.0,No coffee nor any oatmeal ! Unbelievable !!! Only on weekends does this location seem to have problems having anything! So basically this location is open Monday thru Friday because weekends they don't have anything! AVOID THIS LOCATION!! Oh there's no manager on weekends!! Said a great deal what the main office feels about this location!
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-03-09,5.0,"How can you resist when an employee sees you looking in the front window, stops what he's doing, and comes out to invite you inside!? Besides they had me at NUTS! This place has nuts and so much more. It's huge, new and fun. You can get coffee and a pastry for $1.99. In the back is the barista. There's a few stools and a counter up front. They also have sandwiches. There's a lot to absorb. This was my first visit. I'll need to return. 

The decor is cool and modern. They have tables close to the front with free samples of spreads and bread. Everything was colorful and looked delicious. I'm not sure how healthy the isles of candy and chocolate are. They have spices. The coffee beans at $13.99 a pound appear pricy to me. I'm not an expert on exotic coffee beans though. I was intrigued by the machines in the coffee section. 

Bottom line, I've got to go back. There's just so much to take in. It will take a few visits to become familiar with so much merchandise. There's also a place to make butter out of the nuts. Make your own Almond Butter. Your best bet is to go check this place out. We will see how well they do in this location. I wish them luck!"
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-02-28,3.0,"This is an extremely specialized store, and I think there is so much potential to expand upon the concept. For example, theveggie sandwiches here are small and $14.99. In general, the selection of sandwiches is very limited (ribeye, veggie, chicken and avocado). 

I'll definitely consider picking up some of the pastries or nut gifts if I'm in a bind."
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-01-26,2.0,"Meh - really?  What's the actual angle?  Think your local coop bulk section, meets sandwich counter, meets nut roaster, meets olive shop, meets bulk candy aisle, meets limited spice shop.  It's alright, but just.  

Got here for the speciality items, but nothing basic/staple.  All conventional basics are at least 3x the normal price of their conventional counterparts and at least 33% more expensive than their organic counterparts in other locations in the city.

Everything is sold by weight, but there are no scales throughout the store, so you get to wait until you check out to see the damage.

All-in-all, meh.

Though I bet the $18/lb spiced cashews might be tasty."
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-03-28,5.0,"Like Kings Gourmet, but big a Manhattan style corner spot is awesome!!! Like Brooklyn in the Upper East Side. They roast their kits and this is a help yourself to amazing nits. My favorite and current addiction is the charcoal roasted cashews- you have never tasted anything like it and I'm a nut Queen- no comments please. There's also roasted veggies and salads in the back and they're delicious. Love this spot. BTW the Sixth Ave & West 23rd st is temporarily closed & should reopen next week."
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2019-12-17,5.0,"I am SO excited the Nuts Factory has finally opened! Contrary to its title they sell way more than just nuts including a variety of spices, sauces, locally sourced coffee, and obviously nuts! There is also a fast casual restaurant in the back where you can order a variety of of salads and sandwiches.

Since this was opening week they were passing out a few free samples, I tried the halva which is a middle eastern desert made from sesame paste which instantly brought me back to my summers in Turkey. They have such a variety of dried legumes and spices that I can't find in the Whole Foods on 57th and that I always wind up trying to specialty order from amazon online including sumac, bulgur (whole and fine grain), dried fava beans, and black olives (these taste like authentic black olives you would find in Turkey!).

I am probably biased because of my Turkish background to find a place with so many of the flavors that remind me of home- I will definitely be back!"
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-03-08,5.0,"This place is a little place of heaven! Everything is delicious - from their homemade preserves, to their nuts and granola. Oh their olives, don't ever forget about their olives! Price wise- It's a bit high but competitive for the area. I love this place and find every excuse to go here! I wish I could order their stuff and have it shipped to CA for when I mobe"
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-03-10,5.0,What a pleasant gem to find on my walk home today! I love candied nuts and there were SO many varieties here I was blown away! I also love loose leaf tea and fresh brewed coffee and was pleasantly surprised to find the store carried these as well - and spices! Around every corner I found a greater selection of goodies displayed in a visually appealing way. Customer service was incredible  and the staff will be happy to help you sample something. I will definitely be back and recommend anyone to swing on by just for a whimsical stop on your afternoon walk - I challenge you to leave empty handed!

1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-02-12,5.0,"Outstanding new spot! Kind of like a Sahadi's vs Dean &  DeLuca right near Bloomingdales. The place is spotlessly clean, staffed with pleasant folks (still in training mode) and price points are very reasonable given the quality and location. I especially recommend their coffee, cappucino, pastries, fresh baked breads and pitas, grilled vegetables,  dried fruit and nuts, olives, and  Mediterranean specialties. We are eagerly awaiting their delivery service and plan to put them in the rotation for our corporate lunch catering. Get over there fast while they're still giving out samples!"
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-01-03,5.0,"I stopped into the Nuts Factory right after it opened and purchased the freshest peanuts in the shell and their homemade chunky peanut butter and loved both so much that I'm heading there again today.  They have tons of nuts to choose from plus candies, olives, coffee, dried beans and fruits, spices etc.  prices are totally reasonable. Happy they moved into my neighborhood."

1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-03-13,3.0,I really want to love this place. The nuts and candy and spices and dried fruits are amazing. But the Chelsea location opened today and it is all self serve. In the age of corona virus it is a little scary. Too many things to touch and spread the virus.  But if you aren't afraid of the germs it is amazing.
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2019-12-24,5.0,"What a great new addition to the city, Nuts Factory...The freshest, largest selection of roasted nuts I've ever seen or tasted, you can watch them being freshly roasted right in the window on the nut machinery, they also make on premises all sorts of honey candied nuts, smells so good and delish!! In addition they have a small cafe in the back to grab a coffee, salad, pastries or sandwiches....

There's all sorts of chocolates from Italy and chocolate covered nuts, a huge selection of Gummies, Spices, Mediterranean olive bar, as well as some international packaged goods, The freshest halvah from Jerusalem as I was told, try the Malabi rosewater variety, really exotic.

They offer lots of free samples and the young people working there are very friendly and helpful, They say they are opening a second shop next month down on 6th ave. & 23rd st...Welcome to NYC! NUTS FACTORY..."
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-01-13,4.0,I stopped in to their open house.  Spiced olives and nuts were delicious.  I tried their $1.99 coffee and pastry special and both were very tasty.  I sat at their window seats and watched the world go by.  The day before I paid $2.56 at Starbucks for OK coffee and their were no seats.
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-02-20,5.0,"Don't believe any of the naysayers. Everything is of higher quality than anywhere else in the hood. You won't buy nuts, olives, dates etc anywhere else. I'm lazy but still walk the 16 blocks to stock up. Welcome to the hood!!!"
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2020-02-22,5.0,"My favorite specialized market in the UES. If you are looking for a light lunch after Bloomingdales they have a great selection of grilled vegetables in the back. I discovered today new rice mixes, instead of rice I use them with cauliflower rice... is a must try! And also the charcoal cashews is forever our favorite. 5 Stars!!"
1043,nuts-factory-new-york,2019-12-18,5.0,"Fantastic selection of high quality, natural nuts. Most importantly, it's just such a pleasure to be here. The people who work here love it and it shows.

It was freezing outside so I decided to go in because it was the first place I saw coming out of my meeting. There was no line. All the employees were very friendly. They have soups, hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, salads, Mac n cheeses, and lots of different types of yogurts, croissants and sweets. I would highly recommend this place. I had the butternut and ricotta Mac and it was absolutely delicious. Can't wait to try more things when I'm back in town. 

I also love the fact that they do not resell items the next day, they work with charities that cater to hunger so the food isn't reused or wasted. I think every restaurant should do this, it's awesome!"
1044,pret-a-manger-new-york-22,2019-06-24,1.0,"This review is specifically for Steven Sanchez, I recently switched over to Pret a manger from Starbucks. I tried their iced coffee and instantly fell in love. Typically I order a hazelnut iced coffee with two pumps of their regular sugar. Today I walk in and ask for my usual order , and in a very passive aggressive manner Mr. Sanchez goes ""EVERY SHOT IS 50 CENTS"" and usually I've never gotten charged for favoring, which i was very confused. I didn't argue just questioned him on why I've never been charged at this establishment or any other Pret a manger for my flavoring , he then proceeded to ask me ""WHOS NOT CHARGING YOU FOR FLAVORING, GIVE ME A NAME"" and I declined because it was not that big of a deal to me, I just
was curious. I ordered my drink and in the process of my payment he continuously kept stating how it was extra for the flavoring ""50 cents each , 50 cents each"". 
and his tone of voice was absolutely horrendous, and very unprofessional. I will be calling corporate and reporting this issue. I felt embarrassed because he kept saying it so loud."
1044,pret-a-manger-new-york-22,2019-07-10,1.0,"I went to shop #19 on 48th and Madison Avenue in NYC with my friend and we ordered some specialty coffee drinks, a Mocha and a Vanilla Latte. The manager (or so I think ) who was a lady in a yellow dress made the drinks as well as charged us for the order. It was all good until we tasted the coffee about 20 minutes later after lunch. The drinks were very bad (very watery and bland) so we returned to the store and asked for them to be made again. At that point Shaquana (who refused to give her name when we asked 3 times) made a comment about my friend saying ""well you drank 1/2 of it and now you want a refund?"" in a very rude and snippy tone. It didn't go over well with my friend so he took a picture of his drink and asked for her name and she refused to answer. I normally wouldn't complain but I believe the worker in question is the manager and she really shouldn't make any sort of disparaging comment and have a bad attitude when helping a customer.

I've only been to PAM while in NYC. I'm amazed to see how well prepared their pre-made foods are.

1044,pret-a-manger-new-york-22,2017-04-01,5.0,"Very good, consistent, quick and easy food.

I often grab something here on the way home for dinner.

The selection tends to be much lighter - catch as catch can - towards the end of the day as they have a ""made today, gone today"" rule.

Whatever they don't sell they donate to shelters so inventory is tightly managed and it can be slim pickings in the evening.

The portions are lean, which I actually like, as its an appropriate amount of food and also very consistent.

The people working there at the registers are ALWAYS unfailingly polite. Whoever does the hiring/training has a good eye and strong sense of what they expect and it shows.

The juice and tea drinks are very good and have typically both smaller and larger sizes.

They also taste great but one major caveat: check the labels - they are FULL of sugar! Guess that's why they taste good. The iced tea has a fairly high sugar level but it's even higher that listed as a small bottle is really ""1.5"" servings.

So, you're drinking 50% more sugar than is listed.

They just recently added some customized Spindrift lightly sweetened carbonated beverages. 

I've had the Blood Orange & the Lemon Lime and these are much lower in sugar than the juices and teas."

What's also awesome about them is how the change with the times.  There was so much healthy vegetarian food this visit, I found it hard to choose. And, great job getting on the juice wagon too.  I like this location with its proximity to Grand Central.  I'm a total fan."

I frequent this restaurant frequently while I'm in town because I can walk in, get the chicken wrap (it's spicy but can't quite remember the name), a freshly squeezed juice and get out within a matter of less than 10 minutes easily. I see in the other reviews people weren't a fan of the staff but I find them to be very prompt and polite.

The chicken wrap I get is one I would recommend. Their salads are fresh and there's many varieties of dressing to choose from. They also have soups that I haven't tried but they do smell delicious. Fresh fruit is a go here and the coffees seem popular too. Haven't tried the coffees but I will make a note to do that next time for sure."

I asked for a plain croissant (ask for the strawberry jam!) and coffee. The people there are not friendly. I asked for a bag. Then the cashier gives me a bag (saying nothing). Then I had to ask for napkins because she didn't give me any and she looked annoyed. 

Also, this Pret is super inefficient. There was only one line and it was almost out the door (because its a small place and its midtown). When I went to get my coffee, that's when I decided I'm never ever coming back. It was so gross. Coffee spills. Milk dispensers empty for whole milk and almost half & half. I wanted the light roast coffee and one of them was empty. The other one was almost empty. It has really little and squirted all over my hand when I attempted to get my coffee."
1044,pret-a-manger-new-york-22,2011-10-17,3.0,"Pret's an okay lunch spot. Most of the sandwiches are premade, are boxed up, and are overpriced...but aside from that, it's a pretty standard lunch spot in NYC. I had the chicken avocado sandwich, which was pretty decent for a gourmet sandwich, and better than most of the choices available to me at Metro. The one thing that earns Pret bonus points is that they make their chocolate chip cookies in-house, and they do a pretty decent job with them - warm, chewy, and not too sweet. But they do overcharge for them given the size (not worth $1.95 per, even if they are pretty solid).

I come here every now and then; more so because I'm trying very hard to eat healthily and properly, and because the moment I step inside the cookies are calling my name. After being to London, though, definitely stop by one there if you can - prices are paradoxically much cheaper there than in the Big Apple."

1044,pret-a-manger-new-york-22,2011-11-29,5.0,"I go here regularly for lunch - healthy fast food. I don't eat meat except for fish and this place offers excellent options.
I just went in and asked if they had any more tuna salads as I didn't see any on the shelf. They said no, and then offered me 50% off of my meal to makeup for it!!!! WOAH! I thought the man said 50 CENTS, which I was grateful for but I fear I wasn't as enthusiastic as I am now after leaving and realizing I'd paid half of what the food normally cost me! He even discounted my drink and muffin.
This place ALWAYS has excellent friendly customer service - which is a lot to ask for at a NYC chain lunch spot - but this was above and beyond. Apple retail + Uniqlo are known for the best customer service out there, and this place is stepping up to the plate!
Thank you to the man who gave me 50 percent off. I swear I'm amazingly grateful and am a forever promoter!!!!"
1044,pret-a-manger-new-york-22,2012-04-12,3.0,"Pret is my fallback when I don't have a lot of time to go grab lunch, or if it's cold/rainy. Everything I've gotten has always tasted really fresh. My favorite things are the hummus and garden vegetable sandwich and the Mediterranean vegetable baguette. The vegetables are always crisp and crunchy and the bread is always perfect. The farmer's market salad is also a good choice. I've tried their Moroccan Lentil soup, and while it was hearty, I didn't really care for the spices used in it. I did like the carrot ginger, which was creamy and blended well. The flavor is predominantly carrot, but the ginger gives it a nice spicy bite. The miso soup is also always a safe bet, although I'm pretty sure it's a pre-packaged-just-add-water deal. 

The +
- great grab-and-go lunch for under $10
- vegetarian and vegan friendly
- everything is fresh

The -
- they don't always have everything in stock (esp after the lunch rush)
- extremely limited seating
- standard sandwich, soup and salad options (like every other deli in NY)"

For those of you not aware, there's Eintein's first rule of food: ""If a sangwidge has no ingredients, it will therefore be low in calories."" 

--Albert Einstein (he was very hungry at the time and needed caloric intake to finish postulating his theory of relativity. Clearly Pret was not the ideal destination for a repast to satisfy this need).

To with the following: their roast beef with horseradish sauce sangwidge has MAYBE a slice and a half of roast beef some greens and horseradish sauce. It's 470 calories. Here's the breakdown:

http://pret.com/us/menu/sandwiches/slow_roasted_beef_horseradish_1499.shtm

WELL NO FREAKIN' WONDER, because there is NO MEAT on this dang sangwidge. 

Their orange soda with ""No Nasties"" in it is actually really good (although overpriced) and has only 50 calories. That's not bad for a tasty sweet soda.

Sangwidge with no meat + soda = like 10 bucks.

That's insane, am I right? Can I GET a witness??"

I now eat here 3 times a week and the sandwiches,salads and soups are always fresh and flavorful.   I say flavorful because a lot of times when you grab a sandwich or salad at one of those generic lunch places the food looks good but has no taste.  It must be the quality of the ingredients. You can really taste the difference.    I come here for my lunch and go around the corner to a place called 2 Beans for my coffee on my way from grand central. Loving my new neighborhood."

It was pretty good, and I'd probably get it again.

Dear Pret,

May I call you Pret? I think we've been seeing each other long enough now that I can, but you let me know if I can't. Oh, who am I kidding? You're sleek and cool, so hip with your jaunty typeface, that of course I can call you Pret! Anyway, it's been, what? Five years? Ever since I first stepped through your doors in ye olde London, the smell of freshly made sandwiches wafting through the air like so many rain clouds over that city. You were a little jarring, packed to the brim with people, but I learned to love you and the delicious food you offered in the otherwise barren wasteland of English cuisine. 

But I had to move back across the pond, and I was sad; how else would I fill my craving for delicious sandwiches I could have made by myself but was too lazy to? And then! Hark! You followed me! I knew we couldn't stay apart for long. But you were so small at first, just a storefront here, a storefront there, and I thought we'd have to stay long-distance. And then--work brought us together! I was now across the street, a mere minute away from your lovely doors. Once again could I delight in all you had to offer.

Yet you had changed...for the better! There were now hot wraps of tasty spicy chicken, fresh Caesar salads with large chunks of roasted chicken, delicious soups, and pudding! Glorious pudding! Your new friends were so nice to me, so welcoming and jovial, always smiling. I had to move away eventually, again, but my love for you will never die, Pret, and we'll be together again soon.

Love always,
Sylwia"

Salad and Smoothie section has a lot of varieties.

The hot food is prepared daily, you can choose from soup options to pasta to baked chicken to tacos and burritos.

I called the restaurant, they said they would send the correct order in a few minutes.

I got a missed call from the restaurant, so I called back. 

As soon as I called they put me on a five minute hold. Then they went on to say they have no spinach (this is about two hours after placing the original order). I asked why they could not inform me earlier.  The lady said she would only refund me only for the omelette and hung up."

They have a full selection of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options from eggs and hash browns to salmon - and a great dessert/pastry case.
FYI - large bottles of water are $4.50 - go down the block to the duane reade and get 'em for $2.50 each."

The Oreo cheesecake wasn't much of an Oreo cheesecake. It actually was just a regular cheesecake with an Oreo stuck on top and some Oreo crumbles stuck to the back of it. Deceiving much?

I grabbed a cafe au last with soy, a cheese danish and tried some scrambled eggs. Nice range of options like rice, eggs, breakfast meats, salads, bagels. 

The danish was moist and fluffy. The best part was the upstairs seating which was relatively spacious and not crowded (score for New York). The classic diner like atmosphere reminds me of a McDonald's playhouse when I was younger- without the screaming children.

Pros: close to a 4 star due to wide food selection , paninis, salads and hot fresh food and pizzas. Love the hot food selection. Pricing is as fair as it gets and very well priced. Fresh fish with two sides for 11.45! Or pizza slices roughly $4.95 and buy two get a free fountain soda. The turkey panini was also great. There is a wide selection for lunch or dinner.

Cons: The main thing that keeps this place from a 4 star is the seating upstairs which needs to be updated as cushions on seats are completely torn. The ambiance is average and layout could be a little better as you almost miss the hot food and pizza side. The fountain cups are very cheap plastic cups which are usually not a subject worth noting but in this case it was so noticeable.

I also have never gone back to the office to eat my sandwich and get pissed because the bacon isn't crispy like other places- they get it right every. single. time!! So important because I just cannot do floppy bacon- crispy bacon people get me, I know they do. 

Another thing that is important is that all the employees are FRIENDLY!  Especially the cashier, she is so nice and everyone loves her.  A lot of regulars come through this place for sure.  And also the guy who knows my order, I mean how often do you get that in NYC? He's very nice and polite.  

I don't sit in and eat but they do have seating upstairs.  The prices are definitely fair as well.  For my hefty B, E, C with L, T sandwich and my small iced coffee the total price comes to $7.67. I can't really comment on other food because I haven't had much else but I definitely recommend this place for a quick breakfast sandwich and for courteous employees.

She had her back turned to me as she was getting the ingredients together and again she asked me what size and I responded with a louder ""small."" In my head I thought she asked me a different question because i thought it was strange she didn't hear me the first time given I wasn't muttering or whispering. Finally, she turns around and snaps at me saying ""HONEY, what size do you want??"" Then proceeds to point to the cups to tell me ""this is small, this is medium, this is large"" as if I didn't understand English and hand no clue. I am never one to openly get angry or argue, but I firmly responded with a ""I said small"" because I was so taken aback. No apology at all although I feel like it was apparent that I was upset because I genuinely was. So belittling. I wish I had the opportunity to tell her that she should actively try to listen if she is going to ask a question."

1045,isadoras-cafe-new-york,2018-04-10,5.0,"We had lunch here a few times 
while visiting family and friends. 
The servers here are just wonderful 
and have great memories it seems. 
We sat upstairs ( 5 of us )actually seems like
there is seating for 50 people. 3 of us ordered
the baked salmon with sides, the 
filet was huge and absolutely
delicious. The other 2 in our group
went for the italian dishes, chicken cutlet
parmesan and pasta, it was great!
The food is ready buffet
style so not a big wait, just order
and go! Price wise 5 dinners for around $50
in midtown Manhattan!!!!!! The manager, Laddie
checked in on us now and then to make
sure everything was ok, we appreciated that.
Isadora's Café is a Must try!"
1045,isadoras-cafe-new-york,2017-08-03,3.0,"I mainly come here for a chicken burger duringbmy break for work.. It's kind of like a cheaper and faster alternative to Chick Fil A for me. It tastes good and comes with a lot of fries for around $8, which is pretty good if you ask me. 

The only thing I'd advise: don't eat here!! It's not the most sanitary place to eat... I've seen a cockroach pass by my feet while waiting for my food and also their tables and seats are dirty and messed up most of the time.. So if you're stopping by, just take your food and go."
1045,isadoras-cafe-new-york,2018-05-25,5.0,"What a nice simple place to get food on the go. Nice workers, tasty food. We took to go for our hotel room at the Omni Berkshire across the street. Convenient and clean."

1045,isadoras-cafe-new-york,2018-06-14,1.0,"The food here is ok people who prepare the food is very friendly. However, the women who works at the front desk and takes credit card to charge you is nasty!!!! I went there three times and every time she gives an attitude. she is not patient and yell at customers. This will be my last time going there."
1045,isadoras-cafe-new-york,2015-08-28,3.0,"Looking for a lunch or breakfast spot with lots of options? Than this would be a good spot. For breakfast there's a pastry case that is loaded with treats. They also have an espresso bar and hot sandwiches. 

For lunch there's a full salad bar, sandwich case (wraps, flatbread, panini, sandwiches, etc.) as well as a hot section (meatloaf, chicken, pasta, Mac and cheese, veggies, burgers, pizza, etc.)

This spot has something for everyone and there's a dining area up stairs. The food was good and the service was quick."
1045,isadoras-cafe-new-york,2018-04-30,1.0,This is dismal and worse part is the staff. Especially at night time. They are beyond rude. Unreal.
1045,isadoras-cafe-new-york,2018-05-26,5.0,"Great place for coffee and breakfast or a quick bite of lunch. Especially if you are staying across the street at the Omni Berkshire. Can't beat the prices at Isadora or the quality, cleanliness and friendliness of staff"
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2020-02-12,4.0,"Simple & Yummy! They have great presentation and good service. Was hoping to get a chai, but they only have coffee/juice. My latte was great and I would come back."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2020-02-02,5.0,"There are so many of these  around Manhattan. A no frills juice spot, only this location has a super lax cashier that knows his stuff. Wish I caught his name. I mean, no one can make a juice like me, but this place comes it at a close second (Or third lol). I enjoy that they have music in the public restroom-what a nice touch."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2019-06-27,4.0,"Despite no cash I still like Joe & the Juice.  Iced almond milk latte the bomb.  Truly delicious.  I wanted something to eat and they only had two tiny bars at checkout or things available from the menu above - none of which stood out to me.

What going on in NYC these days?  I feel like Neo in that scene in the Matrix where everyone is walking around having no clue they are asleep.  Staff at Joe's was cool and tuned in though.  This specific location is very convenient."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2020-03-05,2.0,Terrible service. People behind the counter ignore anybody at the cashier stand waiting to order and instead all cluster around making sandwiches or smoothies if it's busier than normal. Also give attitude when you ask for someone to help you out and place your order. Clearly goes to show management has no idea how to efficiently run this place or train the employees in customer service.
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-04-26,4.0,"Joe meet Jo. That would be me.
I might have experienced a mini juice from Joe & the Juice once at a wellness pop up event, but never visited a location. Until today.

I'm presuming Joe & the Juice recently made this  Park Avenue location a home since I didn't see it the last time I was in the area.

Joe & the Juice is primarily a juice bar but is quick to add that it is also more. The more includes coffee, tea, breakfast and other nibbles. 

Upon entrance, this space was warm, cozy and very welcoming. With so many beverage franchises, their interior sets itself apart from the others. 
The atmosphere was akin to a living room or a quaint study. Very cute low tables and modern chairs. Wall art adorned the entire space which was quite large.

I placed an order for a ginger latte with the very friendly cashier who seemed genuinely interested in getting my order right. Unlike some other establishments.

I incorrectly thought the ginger latte wasn't coffee based but it was. For $5.01, the 16 ounce latte was ready in minutes.
I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. A nice balance of coffee--not too strong--with spicy ginger. And lots of foam.

If I had more time, I would have preferred to enjoy it onsite. For next time, I'm aiming to try the juice. With names of some of the juices such as ""helluva nerve"" and ""sex me up"", I'm curious to find out if they live up to the creativity.. BTW, it should come as no surprise that the juices run in the vicinity of $8.00 and up.

Real cozy & delicious!."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2019-06-09,1.0,"Got an iced latte and a juice. High cost for a small serving and both were served room temperature. Coffee wasn't anything special and the juice didn't really have a flavor.
Not a great visit."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2017-11-13,3.0,"Sunday afternoon, looking for a quick lunch spot in the area that was relatively healthy & inexpensive. Comfortable, modern interior and plenty of seating available for any sized group. Go up and order at front with a big menu behind the counter to look over.

Decided on the Turkey Sandwich ($8) and a regular drip coffee ($3). No milk available at the coffee station, so make sure to tell the barista before going to get the sugar. Sandwich comes out in 15 minutes, lightly toasted and crunchy flatbread with sliced mozzarella, tomatoes, and turkey slices inside. The turkey is nominal and cold (as well as the tomatoes), while the cheese and bread were standouts. Would have preferred a more melted/warmer sandwich, though it was okay overall. Coffee is solid, and paired well with the meal.

Guy behind the counter was nice and did well considering he was the only one there. Solid spot for quick eats; nothing exceptional however."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-06-19,4.0,Hip and cool juice place.  Love the ambiance and in park avenue. Although cups are in the small side.
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2019-03-31,5.0,"My friend and I were in NYC for a week and we went to Joe & The Juice every day! It was just a good way to start off our days. However, it was the customer service on our last day stood out because the employee (mixed Asian guy with freckles?) was upbeat and patient (qualities not common during the majority of our trip). My friend was feeling sick that morning and wanted something ginger-heavy. The employee made some recommendations and was attentive to what she was looking for. It was such a simple interaction, but I really appreciated his friendliness and effort. This is my favorite chain in NYC."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2019-07-12,4.0,Tasty juice. We hit this up every morning. Go in grab your juice and get where you need to go.
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-11-05,4.0,"I like the green juice here. Coffee is solid, I like the seating and vibe of the place. Usually decent music is playing and it feels like an upbeat hipster yuppy coffee shop. It is higher priced than Starbucks and competitors, and less crowded which is a good thing."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-03-21,3.0,"This is one of a few stores/restaurants in NYC that is spacious with lots of tables and chairs. It's a hip place. 10/10 for the interior decor and space.
5/10 for the drinks. Although the staff were very nice and friendly, they got 1 of our orders wrong. And the price was so expensive... $4 for a tiny cup of latte, $7-8 for a medium cup of protein drink. Ridiculous!"
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2019-11-13,5.0,"Cute juice bar with smoothies, coffee, and healthy meals. I was looking for a meeting spot and a place to do some work and this was a perfect spot.  The açaí bowl was delicious."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-07-07,2.0,"Actually thought this place was a bit overrated and overpriced. I got a power shake which is strawberry, banana, and vanilla milk. I also ordered a joe's club sandwich. The shake was pretty good but I don't think it's worth $7+ for the size. In their defense, the shake tasted good, but the sandwich was average. The sandwich kept falling apart and there wasn't that much avocado. Bread was tough and sandwich kept breaking. Maybe the juices taste better?? Idk. The ambiance was pretty hipster which was cool and definitely would seem like a cool place to do work in kinda like a coffee shop. I don't think I'd come back here just due to the high prices for what it's worth. I think there's other options in NY for better...just my take"
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2017-08-27,4.0,"Walked in here late one evening just before closing time to grab a cup of joe. The interior of the place was very clean, nicely decorated, and had ample seating - I'd definitely recommend this as a place to get some work done! 

Although the employees were closing up, they were incredibly kind and quickly prepped the cold brew with unsweetened almond milk that I ordered. Prices are fairly standard for coffee in New York, with this little chain being on the fairer side of things. The coffee itself was not overroasted (YES) -- I'll definitely be back!"
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2017-12-22,4.0,"This location of Joe & The Juice has a good amount of sitting. The cafe is dimly lit with a dark grey and black look. They have tiny tables to the left and more comfortable seating to the right. 
The drinks sizes are color coordinated so you get a different colored cup according to the size you chose.
The staff is friendly, interactive, and seem to enjoy themselves while working. They have loud hip-hop music blasting which may or may not be a good thing depending on the person. They often repeat songs. It's a little hard to talk over people or get any work done if the place gets too crowded. 
The coffee itself is fine. Not my favorite, but it does the trick. 
I would probably give it a 3.5 stars and it's worth a try, but I'm not sure if I would come again."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2019-06-04,4.0,"Decent smoothies and nice guy at register,  but limited fruits. No cherries, cool. But no blueberry, for real?  No cash accepted either, but tips are accepted in cash lol."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2017-10-19,5.0,This place is awesome. Great machiayro and awesome ambiance. What a find on park Ave.
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2017-07-06,4.0,Joe and the juice is always my favorite place! I'm rating it a 4 because the music inside the place was waaay too loud. I asked the staff to lower it and they didn't seem bothered to do it. Other than that I love the green juices and sandwiches here. They're so good. Watch out because this place is pricey!
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2017-08-06,4.0,"Went here this week to meet a friend and have to say I love this place. It was pretty empty when we were there and quiet. I have read other reviews about loud music but there was little or no music when we were here (the loud music would definitely have been a turn off for me).
Very pricey though - it was just short of $22 for 2 juices!"
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-01-24,5.0,great coffee. great juices. great decor/seating. great ambiance. i have NEVER had a problem with their wifi. it's lightning fast and works like a charm. this place is just great.
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-07-30,5.0,This place was great! The service was super fast and efficient and the employees behind the counter greeted us and were so kind! The place is super cool inside and the smoothies were delicious!
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-04-07,1.0,I'm standing here at 7pm on Saturday 4/7 and was just told that the shop was closed. Update your hours or stay open till the hours stated.
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-07-20,3.0,I love the vibe of this place. The drinks and staff are good. The only reason why I am giving this place 3 stars is because I felt that the drinks were extremely overpriced for what you got. A small juice was $9. Although it was good I felt like the quantity for the price was not worth it.
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-03-16,3.0,"It does not matter which location music is too loud, there must be a better process for ordering as they forget someone or something, too much personal chatting behind bar. Love the product."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2017-06-22,3.0,"Joe & The Juice just opened inside my office building so figured I'd check it out. I'm sure to some extent they're still just working out the kinks, so I don't think it's really fair to knock them for the fact that they were sort of frantic with a morning ""rush"" of about 8 people, but they should obviously get used to it. 

My bigger issue is that I paid almost $5 for a 16oz Cold Brew...and they were not serving Cold Brew. They had ""run out"" but were telling customers they'd have more ""in a few minutes"" as they hurriedly filled a pitcher with hot coffee to let it cool. This is bad in part because it just tastes gross, but mainly because a hot brewed coffee costs less than half of what cold brew costs. Luckily, once I told the barista I didn't want hot coffee poured over ice they offered an iced Americano or latte. The latte was fine but the situation left me fairly unimpressed...and hoping their Cold Brew is normally actually cold brewed! 

I know it's nit-picky, but I also hate that they don't have flat lids for their cold cups. How often do people actually ask for whipped cream on drinks? Do you even need dome lids..?"
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2017-07-19,5.0,"My fav Joe so far. Perfect location to my office. Store is simple but special, Hip Rock n Roll!!! Love Love Love the loud music!!! Please be louder! I give 7 stars to this store.  Drinks are fresh. Good food! Staff are friendly + cool.  Such a lovely Joe on Park."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-08-06,1.0,"Terrible customer service at this location. Staff was unfriendly, and did not care about getting our order correct. Surprising, especially because we were the only customers in the store at the time. The staff also did not seem to know how to make the drink that we ordered. I watched the blender overflow and then they added ingredients they forgot after the drink was already blended. We asked for our three shakes to be made thick, and they couldn't be more watery. The two people serving us were obviously more interested in talking with each other then getting our order correct. Over $30 for three shakes. What a waste!  Won't return."
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-04-20,5.0,"The coffee is always fantastic (coffee roasters), the cappuccino very tasty (although kind of small), and the seating/ environment of this specific location is one of my favs"
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-05-22,5.0,"After my first visit, joe and the juice immediately became my go-to for morning lattes. Everyone who works there is very friendly and they will make the effort to remember your name and your favorite drink. The service is really what makes this location stand out over every other coffee shop in the area and it's refreshing to be able to walk in and out with a latte in your hand in less than 3 minutes"
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2017-07-03,5.0,I discovered joe & the juice down in SoHo a couple months ago. I was so happy to see them opening up in midtown! I recommend the joe's club sandwich and the prince of green juice. The service is quick and the staff is charming. I love stopping by for good energetic vibes throughout a long day. This is quickly becoming my favorite lunch spot to meet up with friends and coworkers. Ps: they have great gluten free options too.
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2018-04-20,5.0,This is the best coffee shop ever! The service is professional. I had a cappuccino and my wife an iced latte. The cappuccino was delicious!!!! The place is neat and clean.
1046,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-26,2017-09-13,5.0,Was on the hunt for a coffee place and stumbled across Joe & The Juice.  Great place.  Even better coffee and service!  Stop in if you have time!
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2018-11-16,4.0,"I have been here at 630 am and the staff is always pleasant and well rested. Sometimes there are homeless people sitting in the seats but it may be a way of life for shops in that area.
It is never really busy at that time so the wait is pretty short. 
I will be back again if in the area"
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-12-05,1.0,"I should really learn my lesson about ordering from this location. Typically, I go to the one in the subway station, but today, my app wasn't working to order from there so I came to the concourse instead. 

BIG MISTAKE.

It's clear that everyone working is overwhelmed with orders. My cold brew literally sat on a table for a while before anyone went to go top it with the Irish Cream but then the cream was so watery that it didn't even situate on top of the drink and just melted straight into it. A new drink that I was so excited for literally tasted like watered down coffee. Also had to wait forever for the drinks themselves that I placed through mobile order, but I'll give it to them that the crowds were insane today to begin with. Going to try to remember to do my best to not come to this location in the future."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-10-12,1.0,"My most recent visit was an awful experience. The lines were not well managed. The line formation was  far away from the cashiers/counters and this easily allowed people who did not see the line form 10 feet away from the counter to just walk up to the counter and stand right behind the person who is currently ordering. 

As the customer in front of me was finishing up their payment and stepping away from the cashier counter and I was making my way to the counter, new arrivals simply walked up to the counter and started to place their order. I had to let them know that ""there is a line"" and pointed them in the direction behind me, and the cashier started to delete the order that was just punched in. I was annoyed and disappointed that the cashier didn't handle it better and continued to take the order instead of  politely letting the customer know that there was indeed a line a few feet away. 

Anyway, I ordered a shaken black tea and my order took 15 minutes. There was steady business and I wouldn't have called the flow of traffic to be ""busy"". I'm sure the place gets much busier during rush hour given its location in 30 Rock with offices above and tourists in the area."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-04-04,2.0,"Located on on the underground level of Rockefeller Center, there's plenty of seating and a good view of the ice rink. I ordered the medicine ball tea which was tasty. The cashier however was rude."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-08-06,1.0,"Worse Starbucks I have ever been to and it has a C rating with the NYC Health Inspection so that says it all. The staff is lost, rude and they took so long, I asked for my money back and left. Get it together."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-10-27,4.0,The setting is very chill. Easy to find. Employees are nice. Bathroom line sucks though.
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-04-11,2.0,"Most popular coffee shop for the masses + located at the most popular NYC tourist attraction for the masses = recipe for disaster. The coffee is what it is: if you like Starbucks then you'll probably come. However, so will 100 others - the lines are long no matter when you come, and to make matters worse, the staff seems to operate at a leisurely pace (think lemonade stand in Kansas and not bustling coffee shop in midtown).

Protip: there's a less crowded location above ground on W48th (between 5th and 6th) that has marginally better lines."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2018-09-24,3.0,"Can't say I'm a ""regular"" at Starbucks, but I do drop by this location from time to time. It's underground, around the corner from my favorite store (Anthropologie) and near many other shops like Banana Republic, Lenny's and a big post office. Because it's Rockefeller Center (major business hub and tourist destination), lines are often long, but pastries are fresh, service is friendly, and lines do tend to move somewhat fast. I've never used it, but there's also a room for patrons to sit and use electronic devices (and Wi-Fi I presume) and large public bathrooms not too far away. I would say it's a win if you're okay with waiting on line."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-04-23,4.0,"Very busy Starbucks but even with the chaos, the staff especially Sam was so patient and helpful and made my drink the way I requested.   Thank you!"
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-05-01,2.0,"Worst Starbucks ever ! 
1. The cashier was extremely rude and act as she did not want to be there when dealing with me but when dealing with the customer behind me she was very professional. 
They pick sand choose who they want to be professional with. 
2. Employees are so engaged in conversation it causes them to move slow. So slow they will make you late for work even though your an half an hour early. 
3. Place is filthy. 

Overvall a bad Starbucks. And I won't be going there anymore. If you want a good Starbucks to go to the one on 52nd, around the corner from TD bank."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-04-19,1.0,"I was in need of an evening snack, so I headed downstairs to Starbucks. There was no line and one customer being rung up at 6:35pm. There were 9 ppl behind the register and all, but one were engaging in personal conversations.  I know dealing with the public can be a challenge at times, but there's no reason as to why I had to wait ten minutes while 8 ppl were doing absolutely nothing. They were all in uniform, so they were clearly on the clock. I work at 30 Rock and this is the main reason I avoid this location. Management really needs to do better"
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2018-12-14,2.0,"Horrible experience this morning ,app orders screwed up. Got to work late because it toke them more than 15-20 minutes to get an order that takes 3 minutes to make. They had dozens of people waiting and people skipping the order . I won't be using the app again and Starbucks just lost a lot of customers . No redemption cards were given and the staff was slow .

Besides that the staff people are nice but it was a bad morning to get your morning fix."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-04-29,1.0,"Truly disappointing 

Not only they're super slow, but when they deliver, they're wrong with the order. 

While we were on que pickup queue, 2 other persons didn't received what they ordered. 

We ordered a decaf Frappuccino and they took forever to make it, and when they gave it to us, it wasn't decaf... Then a warm sandwhich that we had to remind them we had ordered."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-05-16,1.0,"Today I visited this location and received horrible, offensive imprudent service. This complaint is directed towards the manager and the way she is running that store. There is no professionalism, it is discriminatory, extremely filthy and that's just a bit of what I experienced. 

The ""shift leader"" taking my order was rude, passive aggressive, sarcastic and at times demeaning towards me. I would proceed to say something, she would repeat it and look at me like I was an idiot. She told me to speak slower and slow down (even though I wasn't speaking fast). At one point during the order, I actually asked her if something I said offended her because she was incredibly rude to me. I placed the order and after I received several rude glares from the behind the counter and what may have appeared to be her gossiping to other employees about it. I can't fathom her being a position of leadership, it's abundantly clear the negative ambience she has created in the store in comparison to other positive upbeat Starbucks in the area. 

Towards the end of my visit I addressed the manager and told her how offended and displeased I was with the way the employee treated me and all she said was ""I'm sorry you feel that way,"" then walked away. This is probably the worst Starbucks I have even been to, and to receive poor treatment from store manager nonetheless is absolutely pitiful. The way she made eye contact, the tone of her voice and the level of sheer disrespect illustrates poor customer service skills."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2019-09-01,1.0,"I mobile ordered a venti iced latte with soymilk at around 8:40am thinking it would come around 8:50am. However, to my surprise when I got there the man said that he was working on it now. Annoyed at the inconvenience of my drink, I also placed an order for a lemon parfait. I went to the front asking one of the cashiers if I could just grab one, however one of the workers swerved away from me, avoiding me at ALL COSTS. Instead of the workers apologizing for her behavior, they all started giggling, making me feel even more alienated. There is no professionalism here, weekend staff needs to upgrade and get there morals checked. Will not be coming back to this crusty starbucks."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2018-12-12,4.0,"This is a mega Starbucks, the amount of people in and out of here trying to see the tree was astonishing and I cannot imagine how the staff actually keeps up with all of it. Even though it was SLAMMED, the staff were all friendly, and the lines moved extremely fast. The wait was no longer then it is at my local Starbucks. They forgot the whip cream though on nearly everyone's drink they were making that was in my area (huge bummer!) but it was pretty incredible that all of the drinks were actually coming out correct and timely. Good work."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2017-11-25,4.0,"If midtown Manhattan is a city unto itself, the entirety of the Rockefeller Center complex would be one of its boroughs. And within every borough, there needs to be multiple Starbucks within walking distance.

While many may gravitate to the large coffee slinging outpost centrally located next to the skating rink and tree, walk a little further down the path to find the better of the places to get a frap. Although the lines can get a bit long when every employee is trying to beat the 3pm slump, service moves quicker than the Starbucks that is deluged with tourists (to all tourists reading - there is no Starbucks here ;] )

While some drink orders can be a bit rushed the baristas are always happy to fix an issue that comes up. The queuing can also be a bit confusing, as people just congregate in one small corner."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2017-11-10,2.0,"They are doing their best to handle the rush. But they need to do a little better.

Came today for the buy one, get one holiday drinks with a coworker. Didn't take very long to order, but once we had we were left to a mob of people waiting for drinks. Like, dozens of people on just one side. We waited 10-15 minutes for our drinks.

My White Chocolate Mocha was lukewarm. On first sip I thought not very sweet... only to have it get sweeter and sweeter as I drank. The bottom inch of the cup was literally all syrup. They need to heat and mix the drinks properly before serving.

The baristas look super stressed... think they need to hire more people as they are overwhelmed to the point of not maintaining quality standards. I've had okay experiences here before, but it was much less crowded then.

If you really need your Starbucks fix in Rockefeller, then go for it. The Starbucks on 49th and 7th is much faster / more consistent if you're willing to walk. If not, the Blue Bottle in Rockefeller is excellent and, though it may look crowded, will end up being faster than this."

I waited almost 15 minutes, while 6 employees stood around and bullshit with each other, every now and then taking care of mobile orders. 

Finally, I watched in awe as this dimwit took over 5 minutes to make my order. She'd complete one step, and then wander off and continue bullshitting. I also heard her mention to another co-worker at one point ""I know what I'm doing."" 

I heard 3 other customers complain about their orders while I was waiting. Maybe make sure your employees actually know what they're doing, instead of them being useless dopes."

This one sucks!!!  Line moves slow.. like snail mail.

Registers, at times don't even know the drinks... especially their ""holiday ones""... they had to ask each other where it is in the system? 

Barista(s)... please get the drinks in order! How is it possible all customers who came after me left and I'm still waiting for a stupid drink that you somehow forgot it's even in the queue?!?!  Not ONCE, Not Twice but 3 days straight?!   I had to make myself stop going there... just not worth my time.   I will save my $ for when I really want one...

It does not have any sort of closed space except for a small room without a door with random people seating without being customers. Expect a long line to order your coffee and because every barista is in a rush, don't expect your order to be the best you've ever experienced in a Starbucks location. There is plenty of tables and seats in the common area in front of the cafe even though they are provided by the building and not by Starbucks, and the place is usually crowded (especially with the ice rink open). Must give credit to how fast the line moves though. Also, when it's really cold outside, there is a quite strong breeze that makes the stay not pleasant at all."

The personnel was very friendly and passionate about their jobs (as quite always on SB's =). The coffees were made fast and they were delicious. They also put a special flavour in my coffee on my request =)) Especially the Oak meal was such a delicious piece of cake, and cost only 1,25 $ !!

The café was tidy and really calm though we were in Rockefeller center and it was Monday evening? (Or because of that?)

There were already some Christmas products on sale that helped to rise the warm atmosphere. Also the gloomy lights made the atmosphere very special!"

There are 7 employees working but the Christmas burnout must have gotten to them because they are moving slow with production, modest pace for payment, and slow for line distribution. 
I feel bad for the employees but annoyed a cup of sugary whipped cream laden joe costs so much time.
The drink production also had too much ice in the frappaccino."
1047,starbucks-new-york-273,2013-10-17,2.0,"Avoid during the morning rush, the lunch rush, the after work rush. Later in the evening is usually the best, especially during the winter when you can bring your coffee to go and move to the public seating area for a closet window view of the tourist-attracting skating rink.

This location now has better redesigned customers-only seating areas. Still not a lot of seating but it's definitely more gorgeous than the previous incarnation. The new design is sophisticated, with darker woods and chic lighting.

Tips:
1) they have wifi 
2) the have a few outlets to charge your cellphone or laptop (they get full fast though)
3) for men, they don't have a private bathroom but the concourse level has one. Go past the Swarovski store and make a right at 'Wichctaft.  Not sure where the women's bathroom is though. Sorry"

We patiently wait at the counter for a good 10 minutes with each Starbucks worker completely ignoring us. Finally, fed up, I ask if anyone can fix our order, as they gave us the wrong thing. One worker rudely replies ""you have to tell the person that rang you up"". Well, first off, they didn't make the tea, you did, and the label even has the correct ingredients on it. Second, it's a mobile order, so no one rang us up. As I explained this, one girl replies ""we don't have peach so I just gave them passion fruit"". So if you don't have something, you just make something else and hope that your customer doesn't notice? So, finally, someone made our order. No apology. Instead we actually got rudeness in return for simply wanting what we ordered. The worst customer service experience! On top of that, the Frappuccino that we had ordered was also messed up in some way, as it tasted like nothing but cream and ice. Never returning."

I got my coffee quick and when it's cold outside and I need something to warm me up, I don't care about how nice you were, I care about how quickly I get my order.

I'll take this over a Starbucks any day. But seriously, the coffee I ordered was piping hot and made with the perfect amount of cream and sugar. At that moment I needed no sweets so nothing else was purchased, but honestly, I'd come back here again in a minute. I don't need you to be friendly, I'd rather you be fast in this instance and they did what they had to do so thank you."

I was so frustrated and my coworker was appalled at the lady's attitude as well. Eventually I showed her the email (from Dunkin's perk account) and the expiration date (today). She eventually agreed to scan it and of course, it went through. She rolled her eyes and took the cash for the remainder of the order. No apologies at all. Was mortified I was treated this way (it was a birthday voucher, so not a good vibe for my birthday either). Not a Dunkin location I would frequent again if I didn't have to."

There are no seats so everything is to go but it is also open 24 hours. They also have plenty of registers so usually the wait is very short. They have a pick up counter as well, so once you order, you get your beverage, you can get your donuts or sandwiches at the pickup counter. Mobile orders are at the pick up counter as well.

Went in this morning for a Friday treat - toasted poppy seed bagel with cream cheese. ""Sorry, we discontinued the poppy seed bagel"".  Ok, damn.  Got a toasted sesame seed bagel with cream cheese instead.

Came out quickly.  Ok still so far so good.  Get up to my office, unwrap my bagel, and it's barely toasted at all.  It's like they held it up to a hair dryer for 5 seconds and called it toasted. 

I was annoyed. Then I remembered that this wasn't the first time this happened to me at this location. Shame on me for not remembering the 1st time.  Skip this if you want a morning bagel - try Lenwich instead."

1048,dunkin-new-york-165,2014-12-12,2.0,"Ehhh, I've been here a million times because I work in the area and I always try to give this place the benefit of doubt when they mess up on my order.  

I am a latte kind of girl and they always seem to mess up on my sugar cookie lattes by not adding in the Christmas colored sugar on top.  That's what makes the drink.  It is a huge hassle to have to stand there and watch them to make sure they put it or have to open up my cup to see if they put it.  

I've also ordered a few Bavarian cream donuts here and they often mess up by giving me the lemon filled one instead.  I get it looks the same on the outside, but come on.  How many times does this need to happen?  Well, it happened again yesterday so hence my need for a review.  (I don't find reviews of places like this helpful because people will come here regardless for coffee so I tend not to review franchise/chain shops).  On top of getting the wrong donut, my donut was also really stale.  The outside was so hard.  This was the last straw and I think I'll just stick to Starbucks for my lattes and go elsewhere for my donuts.  

With that said, this place is convenient because it's in the train station and it gets a lot of foot traffic.  The workers here are friendly, but they are seriously lacking in their prep department."

The service may be quick which is ideal at that time(rush hour) but its just very annoying to repeat yourself every day. 
The one person that deserves credit in all of this is the woman who runs the espresso machine. she is always quick and calm and gets the orders out in a timely fashion."

One complaint I have about DD is that they don't have the option of soy milk, but that's every DD so I'm not going to hold that against this particular location.

Every morning as I exit the 47-50 St Rockefeller BDFM station, DD is my first stop.  I always get the same thing every morning - medium blueberry, skim, 2 sugars.  How is it that one day, it's perfect, the next day, it's not sweet at all, and the next, it's like drinking diabetes in a cup?  How can you get 2 sugars so wrong?  Basically that's my only complaint... the inconsistency of the one thing I would like right every morning.

The ladies, particularly the one on the far left, are nice, quick, and efficient.  I'm in and out by 30 seconds."

On average theres about 30 people on line, itching to fulfill their caffeine needs and these guys will clear them all out in about 4 minutes. With speed comes robotic service. Cashiers are rude, they'll snatch payment out of your hands and begin taking the next order before you've even received your change. But hey, do you want a smiling barista and a 5 minute wait? Or an angry scowl and a cup of coffee in your hands before you even put your wallet away?"

Cashiers are quick to accept orders and payment without the typical unfathomably nasty attitude index of other Dunkin' Donuts locations, albeit the portral of their unhappiness.  Service is efficient and courteous.  A receipt for picking up your order is required to ensure accuracy, which comforts me to know my order is properly fulfilled. Upon consuming my breakfast sandwich of sausage, egg and cheese croissant with complete and utter dismay it was burnt.

Sure, i enjoy idle chit chat with cashiers and browsing the menu sometimes but honestly who does that at Dunkin Donuts? If i want that experience there's a million small coffee shops around town to do so. This location is near the subway which attracts a lot of people funneling into and out of work at Rockefeller plaza so the ultra fast service is whats needed.  That's why in the morning there's literally 20+ people working at this location.

you have someone hand off my order

1.) This store is dirty and has a ""B"" or ""C"" from the health department due to its being just hundreds of feet away from filthy, rat-infested subway tracks.

You're wrong! It has an ""A"" from the health department, and if you actually visit this location and look behind the counter, you'll notice that it is kept spotless.

2.) Staff are rude or apathetic because they're forced to work in such a hot and unpleasant environment serving - quite a few - very rude customers day in and day out.

You're wrong! The staff is courteous and extremely efficient. You can get your drink or sandwich faster at this Dunkin' Donuts than probably any other DD in the entire US of A.

3.) Speed and location make for inferior Dunkin' Donuts drinks and food.

You're wrong! Every drink and sandwich I have ordered from this location has been as good - if not better - than that which I've received at standalone locations.

Be wowed! Be surprised! Visit the Rockefeller Center station Dunkin' Donuts location. I guarantee you will be amazed!"

My sister asked for a glass of ice water because it was hot. We both had ordered drinks and the girl looked at her like she was from another planet! We are from south Texas and it's hot so we live on iced water and I guess that's not something they do here in NY. I think it's because they can't charge for it like they can a bottle of water. Then I didn't like my drink so it wasn't a good experience.
1048,dunkin-new-york-165,2013-01-17,3.0,"It's a weekday. It's morning rush hour. And you're about to do what you do every single morning after you get off the B / D / F / M. You're going to sprint up the staircase, barrel through the turnstile and pony up the Dunkin' Donuts coffee counter to place your order.

It doesn't matter that you visit at the same exact time and order your coffee the same exact way with the same exact cashier every single day.  They won't remember you.  Or maybe they do and honestly don't give a crap.  Don't get too uptight that the cashier isn't giving you his / her undivided attention.  The employees are most likely given explicit direction by management to receive and fulfill orders as fast as humanly possible, if not faster.  

The cashier is probably going to be already taking the order of the person behind you while you dig in your wallet / purse.  Definitely have your money ready ahead of time.  There's no minimum for debit / credit cards if you don't have cash on hand.  I'm notorious for handing over my card for a $2 coffee.

Just ordering a coffee and / or donut?   Cool.  Your order will be in your hand 30 seconds after you hand over your dough.  Oh, you want to order breakfast too?  That's when things get tricky.  Proceed to the pick-up area in the far corner with your receipt and wait in that unorganized crowd of people who need to get to work ASAP just like you.  Why are you even ordering your breakfast here anyway?  The food isn't that great.  Liberty Deli is just a couple hundred feet down the way.  However, I do highly recommend the hash browns.

Congrats.  You like Dunkin' Donuts coffee.  You have come to grips with the fact  that Starbucks is highly overrated and you finally realize that the coffee you're paying half the price for at whatever cart on whatever corner is glorified motor oil.  Enjoy your day at work."
1048,dunkin-new-york-165,2011-07-01,4.0,"Disembark the BDFM and sprint up the stairs to beat the other commuters on your train.  

The ordering process is a bit of a shitshow:  walk up to one of the two counters and haphazardly shout your order at one of the cashiers.  Hand over money.  Hear 3 more people shout out orders behind you to same cashier.  Jostle with them as they attempt payment. Get handed back iced coffee, double splenda/milk.  

Takes less than 2 minutes.  Perfection."
1048,dunkin-new-york-165,2012-09-19,2.0,"My Dunkin Donuts experiences have gotten progressively worse. I practiced my order, I even tried to simplify it to help streamline the process but no luck.

Today I ordered the same thing I do every day. These people know my face and probably my credit card number by heart. And yet again they messed it up after I had waited about 10 minutes. 

Today the guy at the back counter was extra shout-ey and keeps asking people for their receipts BEFORE the order is even ready and then forgets what was on your receipt. He grabbed my receipt, yelled something, and handed me the wrong cup of coffee. It was iced - I never order iced. It was 60 degrees out. 

So I slammed it on the counter, gave him the stink eye, and abandoned my latte and the $3 I paid for it. You have to stand up for your rights. 

Honestly, it might be worth the extra dollar to walk across the corridor to Starbucks, get premier service where a barista takes your order over a fancy microphone, and you get you coffee efficiently and the right cup .. without being late for work."

By that, I mean I went out by myself to run errands such as getting dinner from Tri Tip Grill (read my reviews) & grabbing breakfast before heading home.

I was able to get 6 donuts for 4.99 which I thought was really fair, especially given this was New York City & this is a big name chain.  Unfortunately, this is the only good thing I can say.  The donuts were only so-so & they were not very good after being in the bag over night.  The day before my purchase, the boyfriend's parents actually got some donuts for themselves & they were already tough off the shelf.

Not only was the product only so-so, the service was also really blech.  I get that this is a high pressure job having to serve tons of people @ this super busy location, but please respect your customers & more importantly, your profession which I admire because I know I would never be able to handle."

But anyway I got my salad box and cold brew.

Salmon, Mango & Avocado Balance Box [8/10]: Flavorful. The mix of salmon, avocado made it refreshing. Would like to have many spinach in the salad. I don't remember what's the dressing. I didn't use it. The mango was in bite size but it's sour (not sure if it's ripe yet). Also, I feel that my quinoa was overcooked and quite mushy.

Environment [10/10]: It is clean and spacious. There is a short line when I got there (like 5 - 6 ppl). A lot of people just grab and go so fairly easy to find a seat. 

Service [10/10]: The staff is really really friendly and energetic in my opinion."

I drank a little bit and then kindly asked the cashier if I could get another drink instead, even half a drink. To my surprise, the cashier was rude and said this is what I ordered. They said if I wanted another drink, I can pay for another drink. Never did I expect that kind of customer service... I had never tried the drink before and it wasn't what I expected at all. The cashier did not even apologize or was sympathetic.  For a $6 drink I expected better. Pret needs to change their customer service or they're not getting my business again.

1049,pret-a-manger-new-york-77,2020-01-28,1.0,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AFTER YEARS AS A LOYAL CUSTOMER.  I came in on Friday for probably the 900th time as I have been frequenting this coffee shop for the last 3 years almost every day. There are times when customer service is not great, and that's OK and we all forgive that but today was a completely awful experience. I waited online only to be met by the rudest lady who didn't look up when said ""yes?"".  I then ordered a large green tea with lemon. She called it out and never spoke again as I paid. I waited on the side and the overwhelmed gentleman making coffee had to make about 8 drinks. So I patiently waited and watched as my cup of tea with the tea bag in it sat there for several minutes. He must have lost track and I don't blame him, but my cup sat there as he made drink after drink for people who had ordered after me. Finally I asked if I could please just take the cup to go (because I can pour hot water over a teabag). The lady who had helped me noticed that I asked for my Tea and had been waiting for several minutes while the gentleman making drinks was obviously making drinks for people who had ordered after me over and over again. She proceeded to pour the water and BERATED me and yell at me that I should have patience. She then made a big deal out of it and poured hot water over the tea bag that had been sitting there for 10 minutes. When I asked her for lemon she rolled her eyes and muttered about me and said that I should have patience. It was so inappropriate. I walked away completely disgusted and couldn't believe that I had been insulted and yelled at for simply asking for my tea that had been sitting there for 10 minutes. She then aggressively came from out behind the counter, walking behind me, and started yelling loudly in the store so that her coworkers could hear ""gotta have patience! Gotta have patience"". I was so uncomfortable, and my colleague was with me and couldn't believe this was happening either. This was Friday morning Jan 24th at 9am. She knows who she is. I will never set foot into the store again. My name is Jeremy Romine I work on the 4th floor of 99 Park. My colleagues are disgusted by her behavior as well. We will not be back."

GET THIS STORE HELP, CORPORATE.  It continues to blow my mind that this store has not yet closed. Location is the only thing going for it.  TWO managers have already been replaced.  What should be a two minute process in getting your morning coffee turns in ten minutes for me.  There has not been ONE time my drink has actually been made.  It's ALWAYS forgotten.  I watch customer after customer order their drink and 50% do not receive their drink because the baristas can't move that fast and they can't comprehend a fast pace environment like that.

Coffee was perfectly roasted and really love flat whites, and the avo toast with an egg put the whole thing together. Definitely will be repeat customer.
However I'd like to propose instead of shortening Avocado to Avo, we all call it Cad instead (sounds like kod). Yeah that's a fish name I know that but I would rather call something a cod toast than an avo toast since it has 1 syllable and just rolls off the tongue easier, at least it does on mine.

Known for their amazing long blacks (improved version of the Americano for the uninitiated), this no-frills location brings BL coffee to an under-served area in the heart of midtown. In addition to quality coffee, the delicious cookies and banana bread are also making regular appearances at this location. This is a welcomed alternative to the Gregorys and Macchiato chains that clog up midtown east and west.

1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-06-18,4.0,"I walked in here today since I always see people in my office with coffees from here. As soon as you walk in, you instantly feel like you're in a small beach town coffee shop. Except in the mornings it's usually crowded with people in suits and business dresses. 

The menu is pretty simple to navigate with cold brew being their top iced coffee choice. I ordered that and asked them to put milk and simple syrup. The milk and simple syrup were both self serve. I found it kind of strange that they had their simple syrup bottle in a plastic unlabeled squirt bottle since I wasn't sure if that's what they were referring to. It was a little watered down and I was confused if it was even sweetening my drink. 

The service in the morning was a little slower than I normally expected but that's definitely expected since it was early on Monday morning. 

Overall, the cold brew tasted good and I probably should've spent more time trying the syrup. But again, 8:45am on a Monday I was just trying to get out of there."
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-06-19,4.0,They have some strong coffee. This stuff packs a kick to it. Ordering was easy. The only bad thing is they don't add milk and sugar to your coffee. They give you a cup of coffee and point you to the milk and sugar. I had to add sugar twice and still didn't have enough. I wish the process was simpler. I just want coffee and I want to go. I don't want to be taste testing my creation for 10 minutes lol.
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-05-23,5.0,"I love the availability of cold pressed juices and various toast selections. I ordered the smoked salmon toast.

1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-11-10,5.0,"Friendly staff, nice, bright place and a darn good cold brew with a nice area of milk options. The Chai Bundt was nothing special, but solid. I'll definitely be back."
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2017-10-27,4.0,"The coffee here is so good, but expensive! A basic latte is $4.75 + tax; and if you get soy milk it's an additional $0.50 add on. I usually get Bluestone Lane coffee on days I decide to treat myself to a good cup of coffee, otherwise I stick to that water down office coffee (yuck). Unlike Starbucks, they do not burn the beans which makes my espresso based drinks very smooth and creamy tasting."
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-10-09,5.0,"The only place in NYC that has coffee as good, if not better, than back home in Australia. Proper espresso coffee and great food. I just wish these were on every corner instead of Starbucks."
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2017-10-22,5.0,"This is perfect coffee and excellent service.  Get the Australian specialties, the Flat White and the Magic.  Today, a Sunday, I went in at 8:30 believing they might be open only to discover their opening time was at 9 am.  Any heartless chain coffee would have told me to come back in 30 mins but the owner, taking pity on my confusion and seeing the bleary hungover appearance, stopped his prep and whipped up two drinks for me on the spot, explained the menu, and at no point let me feel like I was screwing up his morning routine (which I definitely was).  And the coffee was outstanding--the Magic (similar to a cortado) is a new favorite.  Intensely flavorful.  

Bottom line is you don't have to take a 14-hour flight to Sydney to enjoy an Aussie-style cup from an actual Aussie (judging from his accent) barista."
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2017-11-14,4.0,I have been looking forward to visit this coffee shop long before it opened across the street from my office. Great australian style coffee. I got a matcha latte for my first visit and its so rich and creamy! Yum! The place is a little bit crowded during the afternoon coffee hours cuz of all the bankers so it was kinda difficult to find a place to stand while waiting for ur drink to be made. I would definitely come back again with friends and coworkers.
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-12-23,5.0,"One of the best places for coffee in the city and the friendliest staff (Kelvin, Josh and Walter to name a few). Relaxing and chill atmosphere while you enjoy a great cup of coffee."
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-01-14,4.0,"Plus 2 stars for the British girl and the tall dude with the beard. They were both super cool and helpful. I'm glad they were there this time to help us. They were really genuine and took time to explain some of the lesser known drinks on the menu. I want more shops like this in area - smaller who still care about coffee. A good way to combat the rampant Starbucks invasion around the area (49st has two Starbucks on the same block in sight of each other.. Seriously). 

Plus another star for the owner who actually took the time to care and not just reply with a generic ""We will do better"" answer. I love blue bottle because their coffee is good and their employees are awesome. The matcha latte from here was bomb diggity. I guess my first experience was a timing kind of thing, but I'm glad I gave this place another try. Cheers mate"
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2019-05-31,5.0,Had an issue here in April 2019 with the avocado toast. Management reached out to me to rectify the situation. Really appreciate their attention to detail on the situation and how they were able to address it. Thank you!
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-08-12,5.0,"Goodbye Gregory's, I've found my new go to coffee spot in midtown east. The coffee here is smooth and non dairy milks like oat are no extra charge, whereas typically at coffee spots the soy isn't extra charge but everything else is, so it actually ends up being cheaper and better here if you prefer non dairy!"
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-06-11,4.0,Really good but EXPENSIVE!! FYI the small Aussie iced latte ($5.50ish) is a giant cup of iced coffee with a scoop of ice cream in it - very yummy but it is very decadent (but not overly sweet). FYI - no table seating or bathroom in this place.
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-03-22,5.0,"Nicest baristas, BEST gluten free avocado toast! Made my morning. Can't wait to try their other GF, vegan options!"
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-03-07,5.0,"The coffee is delicious, made even better by the fact that they offer Oatly oat milk. The staff could not be friendlier, especially Ruddy, who remembers my name and my order every morning. The roasts are also delicious and perfect for a filling breakfast ."
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-07-17,4.0,Good coffee and quick and easy food. A good spot for on the run coffee. Have never been to one of their legit sit down cafes but I would e finitela give it a try. Solid coffee every time.
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-08-17,5.0,Stumbled upon the best coffee in NY at this little shop. I had a beautifully crafted latte and was tempted by all their baked goods!  The service was excellent and  the staff couldn't have  been more  friendly. Thank you for the wonderful start to my day!
1050,bluestone-lane-new-york-20,2018-12-11,5.0,"Friendly staff, great cappuccinos, and a good selection of baked goods - banana bread and brownies are especially good. Very fast service in spite of being busy at certain times on weekdays"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2020-01-19,5.0,"This Gregory's is on point. The staff just makes the experience enjoyable. I am contrasting this with the DC stores- which is where I live. They could come  teach DC a few things about customer service. Except for Jacob. He's consistently professional and positive and makes a good beverage. 
The latte was perfect temperature, ratio of espresso to milk, and was beautiful. Thanks for making my morning!"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-12-30,1.0,"The coffee is bad enough not for them to have an attitude when serving the coffee.
Maybe it's a location issue but these guys should be trained to deal with customers"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-04-12,4.0,"One of the better locations in the city! The espresso they use smells and tastes fresher. The baristas froth/steam the milk into a nice thick and soothing texture that I like. The other locations don't steam the milk enough that it becomes thin and fluid within minutes (might as well just order drip coffee and add milk). I usually switch between the latte, cappuccino, and matcha latte with oat milk when I order here. Though, I wouldn't recommend the hall & oats or the avocado toast. Hall & oats is definitely an acquired taste and the avocado toast was expensive and ordinary. I would just stick to the classic espresso/coffee items. 

There are enough seats for at least 20-30 people, but it doesn't get too crowded often. The employees I've encountered so far carry out great service with mindful attitude. The atmosphere is inviting and calming. Good for working. They accept apple pay and chase pay. You can accumulate rewards on their app (powered through LevelUp)."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-02-02,3.0,"Short review incoming! First stop after landing and making my way to the city. I honestly had no clue this was a chain, but felt like it was just from the vibe and interior.

Breakdown:

Pros-
Quick service
Ample amount of different sugars/sugar substitutes/creamers/milk etc.
Decent amount of seating for how small it was
Decent neighborhood

Cons-
No interaction from the staff, sort of awkward
Prices were a tad high for the amount of coffee you were given
Quite bitter black drip coffee
Inside was dirty and looked like it had not been cleaned in awhile

Was it the worst experience, no. I have had some same experience at various Starbucks as well, so it's probably a thing with these chains. So in the end it is a chain and if you cannot wait to get a cup of joe or special drink, then give it a go. I would personally find a smaller mom and pop coffee shop or your standard Starbucks store."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-03-12,4.0,"I love Gregory's! The coffee is always great and I also love their smoothies and toasts. This location is consistent in terms of the taste of their coffee, but be aware that they don't have a ton of seating. I came during the morning rush today and they did a great job of taking our orders before we even got to the register. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that I had a longer wait than I expected for an iced latte. They only had one person making drinks and I think an additional hand would really help during the morning rush. However, you can order ahead on the Gregory's app! Next time, I will probably do that. Overall, it's a good place to get a coffee and a snack on your way to work in the morning!"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-02-24,2.0,I come here every weekend for a cup of latte. Not sure what has happened recently but are they having milk trouble nowadays? The milk foam used to fill the whole cup.
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-09-30,5.0,Nothing better than stop by #GregorysCoffee in the mornings and get my day started with a delicious latte made by an amazing and super friendly staff. #LoveItHere
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-01-04,3.0,"Gregory's Coffee has good reputation for being a local chain that adds some delights into the city of New York. However, this location's coffee was nothing but plain that resembled Starbucks without being Starbucks.
Pros:
_fast service
_unique coffee
_nice space for doing work
Cons:
_not creamy or sweet coffee
_honey badger coffee tasted bitter
_could barely taste coffee
_nu latte Nutella was unnoticeable
Overall: Honestly, we would prefer other coffee, but this coffee shop does fulfills its niche for coffee lovers that want to a place to relax and drink something not loaded with sugar."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-06-29,3.0,"I wish coffee shops wouldn't ignore tea. I went in hoping to support an independent coffee shop by picking up a fancy tea, and still only had the options of green, black or chai. As far as vibe, Gregory's had an upscale feeling to it. Small (like many of the coffee shops in the area), I imagine it could get pretty crowded at peak time. If I were a local, I can't say I'd stop in very often, though, because their tea options just weren't there."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-12-20,4.0,"This is my first stop before hitting the office everyday. The staff, especially Rebecca, is attentive and genial, and they're careful to make my coffee drinks just the way I like them.  Relaxed vibe, and good coffee to start the day, makes everything better!"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-04-19,3.0,"This is my favorite to-go place for coffee theses days. I always ordered coffee in the morning by seamless since when I visited in NYC this time. My friend ordered coffee for me even if I was sleep also I ordered coffee for us if I wake up early. I've been tried many of different coffee and their donuts or breads or snack. But most of my favorite was iced americano. Sometimes they forgot to delivery with straws and I had to drink without straw but it's totally nothing problem with me. Their iced americano was not too deep tasted than Starbucks. Some of Starbucks locations americano coffee was burn tasted but This place ice americano tasted was perfectly not too deep tasted but if you like deep coffee taste, you wouldn't like this place also you can taste watery if you like dark roasted deep coffee. I am a huge fan of coffee and I had to drink coffee every morning or every times. I couldn't count how many coffee I drinking in one day. Coffee is as water to me but I tried not to drink coffee a lot in one day but still I drinking coffee a lot than other people or drinking coffee more than water too. They delivered service was amazing and packed well too. Delivery time was always faster than estimated delivery time. That's why I used this place a lot. I only give 3star because other coffee wasn't good than ice americano or I expected. I thought other kind of coffee was also good as ice americano but it's not. If you want try this place coffee, I can tell you try ice americano or hot americano first."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2020-01-09,5.0,"I've been drinking Gregory's coffee and lattes for a few years now; I find the quality of their products much higher then those of similar chain coffee shops (Starbucks, Pret, Etc.). I also enjoy their loyalty system and rewards structure. Out of their locations in the city, this is my favorite. The staff provides excellent knowledge of the products, as well as takes great care in brewing and learning the names of the customers. Overall, this location has all the perks of a small town local coffee shop vibe while being in a large city. Highly recommend."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2020-01-08,5.0,An amazing and wholesome place where I get my coffee every morning. The staff knows what I drink and they greet me very kindly. As transgender person sometimes i feel unwelcome in some places but the staff at Gregory's has consistently made me feel welcome. This is my go-spot for coffee and donuts and a little bit of laughter with the very lovely staff.
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2020-01-08,5.0,I randomly popped into this coffee shop and it was such a warm welcoming experience. The manager Rebecca was very sweet and helpful. The staff super friendly.  I got the hall and oats it's delicious.  Shawn was very helpful letting me sample the different cold brews they have. Would definitely recommend.
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-09-15,2.0,"Forgot to make my toast causing 20min wait and no apologies.
They need to have a better service."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-12-17,5.0,"Love the coffee, speedy service, and friendly staff at this neighborhood gem. Rebecca, Shawn, Aaron and Toni (and everyone) take such good care of us that we go nearly every day."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-03-07,3.0,I walk by this coffee shop three times a week headed for work. Stopped in for the first time today. Customer service is not that great. The employees are not friendly. The space inside is pretty small. I ordered a medium sf vanilla latte with almond milk. I like that they have milk alternatives. The foam and the latte were both very good. They have a nice subtle flavor. I like that they accept Apple Pay. I've heard birch is better so I likely will not return to Gregory's. My latte was $6.86. That's very high! It was not worth the cost.
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-04-23,3.0,"I drink alot of coffee so I have a pretty good standard for coffee. Gregorys coffee is very strong, but the taste leaves room to be improve. A little bitter and lacking aroma, priced a little bit more expensive compares to other similar coffee shops.

Clean space with nice design, small. Friendly staff but service is slow. Food menu is expensive. Overall I'd come here if I want a strong coffee to keep me going, but I wont come for the taste or the price."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-09-19,5.0,"I passed two other Gregory's on my commute just to come to this store. I like the atmosphere and offerings that the company as a whole has to offer, but I love this particular location. I'm in here constantly to get some work done during the day. The staff and management are the BEST. They greet me by name and have my Spicy Avo & Cold Brew ready to go. As long as they're here, I'll go out of my way to keep coming!"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-10-31,5.0,"Gregorys menu is a modern take on coffee and nutritious snacks. The menu has everything from STRONG black coffee to one of my personal favorite drinks called ""Honey Badger"" which is cold brew mixed with almond milk and honey. The combination of flavors is an absolute delight. They also have various smoothies, juices, and nutritious breakfast and lunch options. However my favorite thing about this Gregory's is the staff. I love starting my morning with them because they are always energetic and vibrant. Rebecca, Shawn and Toni have infectious personalities and know exactly how to brighten your day. Rebecca delivers an exceptional level of service and Shawn makes a mean cappuccino. I go out of my way to come here every morning. It is my favorite location by far!"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-10-30,5.0,"I'm a local in the neighborhood and I have to say, this is the best coffee shop location in the city. The entire staff including the female manager are so amazing, kind, up beat and attentive. It feels like a mini community. And on mornings I need my dose of coffee more than others, they always brighten my day. Best staff! Keep up"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-09-17,5.0,Consistently delicious and (very) strong cold brew. Always friendly service. I've made Gregory's a daily ritual.
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-09-17,5.0,"Great coffee, very friendly staff. Lots of seating. A good place to stop by before a show in Times Square, or while walking around Hell's Kitchen."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2020-01-31,5.0,Great service and friendly staff that remember your name. Cozy location in the heart of Hell's Kitchen.
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2018-04-19,3.0,"The hot chocolate was rich and chocolatey, but why such a limited amount of seating, and a nonexistent amount of outlets? If you're planning to meet your Tinder date here, arrive early to stake out chairs, because there's very few options. I hate being on the hunt for seating when I'm at a cafe (we're not animals!), so I didn't enjoy that, but besides that, friendly service, delicious drinks, and strong WiFi."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-10-08,5.0,"The best hydrafuel cold brew ever. I suggest you get it with macadamia but milk, it is heavenly. Great service, friendly staff. Made my mornings in nyc for the week fantastic!"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-09-24,5.0,"I love this place. It is a great location to do work. It is very comfortable to do work here. My friend and I literally spend hours here almost everyday. The staff are just amazing and very friendly. And of course the coffee, try their soy latte, delicious!"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-07-03,2.0,"I got a very much lackluster Almond Berry Toast to-go. Way too much almond butter in proportion to the berries. They also just dump a load of chia seeds on top so it's a super dry toast. If you don't get a drink with it, beware! Extra star because it's a cute place to study."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2018-05-15,3.0,"A month later, i finally I am back for a second visit. But realized that the price of this place is so high! 4.60 dollars for a small hot latte? C'mon... the taste and consistance is good, but it is a bit much for the quality that they do provide. If you have more cash to burn, go visit their coffee shop (and kudos to you!). But I would not recommend it for anyone who is just looking for something to refresh their spirits. 


****** a month ago*****
I would go out my way to support any high end  non-Starbucks coffee shop. The ambiance is nice, and the cold brew is great! I would have tried the aeropress coffee, if it didn't take 6 minutes to be done. Oh well, next time! :-) the only complain would be, there are fruit flies flying around, which kind of kills the mood."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-05-03,2.0,"I was coming here for about a week straight when I first moved into the area to do some studying. Unfortunately, the last time I came here was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a coffee shop. I order my usual almond cappuccino, and it came out like a latte. I asked for them to remake it and it came out lukewarm, and it just tasted horrible. It was such a poor experience that I ended up not drinking my cappuccino and left immediately to find another coffee shop. I would have stuck around there if the employees were a little bit more friendly and approachable, but unfortunately, they weren't. It looks like Gregory's coffee shop isn't into providing excellent coffee nor good customer service, and that's why I give them two stars. It's such a shame because they could have been a great little neighborhood coffee shop for locals. Oh well.​"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2018-01-30,1.0,"Expect to pay $6 for a regular cup of coffee. Usually paid $3 something. Not much of a big deal but it appears to be that prices have increased for Regular cups of coffee""

I reiterated to the Barista : ""Regular coffee? "" and she said ""yes"". 

Not worth the price."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-03-22,2.0,"I hate writing ""bad"" reviews. The menu has interesting, unique options but overall the shop was a disappointment and I wouldn't recommend. The barista who served me was unfriendly and seemed irritated that I had questions (I asked two). I got the Nu Brew which is drip coffee, Nutella and milk. Sounds awesome! In reality, it's pre-mixed Nutella/milk syrup that is mainly milk. It made the coffee luke warm and sadly, it was flavorless. Disappointed :("
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-10-25,5.0,"I live two blocks away from this location, and this has always been a go-to work spot for me when I want to work remotely and grab a coffee. Unfortunately for a while there, the lead manager running this location was just a sour, unhappy, angry, unpleasant person which is why I'm sure you're seeing many reviews complaining about that. The whole reason I'm writing this one is because there is new leadership at this store, and the entire vibe has completely changed and all for the better. Rebecca has turned this store around and changed the vibe entirely. The store is cleaner, more friendly, and it feels like all of the staff are happier. Toni is a phenomenal barista and assistant manager as well and has always been a gem at this store. I look forward to seeing Rebecca and Toni daily. The coffee here has always been great, Gregory's has great product (though I wish they had an iced coffee that wasn't cold brew) but I'm writing this because it's amazing how one staff member change can alter so much in the store. I've been coming a lot more these days and will continue to. If you're in HK, skip Starbucks, skip Dunkin, and come here."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-10-08,5.0,You must try the hydrafuel cold brew! It's delicious! I suggest adding the macadamia nut milk. Super friendly staff and a great environment.
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-09-26,5.0,"This is the best coffee shop in Manhattan! The staff is so friendly and they always know my order. Not only is there a welcoming atmosphere, the coffee itself is delicious. I start every morning here!"
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-09-18,5.0,"The staff at this location is a joy! So warm, friendly, and accommodating. Toni and Rebecca always brighten my mornings. The cold brew is awesome as well! Definitely one of my favorite coffee joints in the city."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2019-09-17,5.0,Great place to start you morning! I go here every day before work and the service is always quick. The baristas always remember my order and they're always very friendly specially Toni and Rebecca!

1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2018-08-27,2.0,"I'm not surprised to see that this location has the least amount of stars.  I went in and ordered a smoothie. Then someone came in after me and ordered a coffee. I'm still waiting for my smoothie.  The barista almost gave me someone else's order. ""What are you waiting for again?"" A SMOOTHIE! That is when they started making it, seriously? I've already been waiting. It was not busy and there was no one ahead of me and only one person after me.  I shouldn't have waited as long as I did. The staff was more invested in their little conversation than making sure all of their orders were made.  The smoothie was fine but I won't be back."
1051,gregorys-coffee-new-york-32,2018-01-20,5.0,"Wonderful little shop with excellent coffee. I had a Cortado (usually go straight espresso but decided to change it up tonight), and it was great. Excellent espresso, and the price wasn't bad for the area ($3.60). I will note, it did take about 3-4 minutes for my drink during a low volume time, so I can imagine service to potentially be slower during high traffic times of day."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2020-01-01,4.0,"What a lovely starbucks! I have been to many a starbucks (work from home perks), but this one has just amazing staff and customer service. From the morning until late, the staff is cordial and helpful and know their regulars, their orders etc. I think I was surprised to see/overhear this level of hospitality within a Starbucks in the city. The staff was consistently working and cleaning, greeted everyone as they came in, was timely with orders, and even came around to collect trash, deliver orders with the utmost courtesy etc. There is ample seating and it is quite a spacious area, not bad at all of a place to do work. 

I will say the spinning door could use some work (it's fine if you're looking for a workout), but it definitely takes some effort to go in and out. But otherwise, I would definitely return for another city work from home day!"

""Why not"" I asked. The answer was ""points can only be redeemed for items $19.95 and below."" This is a poor rewards system and needs to be revised. Customers should bee able to redeem points on any item. It's a bad business practice to force customers from actually getting the item they want. Shame on you Starbucks. Shame, SHAME."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2019-10-10,1.0,"It is near my office but service can be quite bad. Takes them long to finish even if i ordered it earlier than those by the counter and mobile. Plus they got my order wrong, i wanted to bring it back but was in a hurry. 

Also my friend who tried to use the app with the promo was not honored and no effort to at least compensate. Don't know how the service has been bad."

This location is medium size, has seats on the side, restroom and coffee came out quick."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2019-06-01,4.0,Location is small and had limited seating. The staff is friendly and they make your drinks quickly. They offer mobile pay and pickup which is convenient if you live or work nearby and want to avoid the sometimes long lines. They make great blended drinks. I highly recommend their cold brew.
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2018-04-19,3.0,"This is a good sized Starbucks located at the base of the News Building.

There's an open space in the middle with a few tables and chairs lining either side.  It was a good place to wait for a bit, but more for the take-out crowd.

You need a code to use the bathroom."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2019-11-10,1.0,Holy hell. This is a horrible Starbucks. They messed up my order. Then I asked for an extra cup of ice for my iced tea because by the time they finished the rest of the order the ice had melted. He yelled at me to order that at the register next time. Then gace me iced water. So I went to the register to get a cup of ice and she practically threw it at me. Um. Really?

1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2019-04-24,2.0,"This location, near Grand Central and tucked away next to the subway stairs, falls flat. The managers aren't particularly friendly. And the decor is like a cramped cave (though it's not their fault given the real estate they were given). For actual smiles by staff, try the nicer location on 3rd Ave/43rd or 42nd St ar 2nd Ave (the 42nd St one can be crowded)."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2018-09-14,5.0,"This is the best Starbucks, period. I get mostly drinks here daily, sometimes twice daily and everyone from the manager to all the baristas is friendly, courteous and quick. Of course the occasional newbie will slow the roll a bit but I have to say my experience here is always great - even prime time when it's busy. The store is always clean and you need a code for the bathroom."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2016-04-29,3.0,"Not the worst Bux by any means at all. Has a restroom, lots of space, nice and quiet AND has a Capital One ATM inside. It's a great Bux to work from home at, because it's so quiet.

They're cheap with refills! Whenever I'm working, they always interrogate me about whether I was in the store. I guess it's their job but still. It's 5 cents of coffee and I gotta get back to my laptop. 

There is one lady who works the register in the morning who is really sweet and I like going back to order from her. She had brown hair and works weekdays."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2019-08-21,5.0,"This is my most favorite Starbucks. Everyone knows my order and they always make it exactly how I want it. When there is some down time, I enjoy talking to them about various subjects, like movies. I do a lot of studying and reading here. It's my home away from home."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2019-05-30,1.0,"I love Starbucks coffee but ai wasn't able to stay here to have one for two reasons: 1) the music was way too loud and aggressive, like a disco; 2) the place is large and beautiful but it has barely a few chairs and tables and no room to sit. I ran out."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2018-06-18,4.0,I go to this starbucks atleast once a week and have never bad a bad experience! Its always on the busier side so things tend to be a bit messy at the sugar station but all the employees have always had good attitudes and never have I had a messed up order
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2018-12-31,1.0,"We just got drinks for the entire family at this Starbucks. Entered the store cheerfully and exited absolutely disgusted. Extra hot coffee was room temperature, easy on ice drinks were filled 3/4 of the glass with ice. Girl name Ruby who worked there was bitching and making faces nonstop. Saying things like why are you still here, I had to remind her that we didn't get all our drinks yet. She was mean in front of my kids and said we are about to close and she didn't want to see anymore customers. I told her it's still not past 5:30 and you should have locked that door- which she obviously couldn't because the store doesn't close as per her wish. I will take up this complain further with Starbucks seniors and make her realize that she can't behave the way she did. I'm sure it's all recorded on their store cameras. We literally felt why the heck we entered that place:(("
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2017-01-11,2.0,"The employees aren't ever friendly, they have gotten my order wrong multiple times or forgotten items, and then today I asked for an egg sandwich. I went back to my building and pulled it out--the bread was literally in fragments with the cheese melting through. Obviously these people don't have pride in their job or even care. You're better off walking a little further and going to the local coffee shop around the corner. I know from being a manager in retail that things get hectic and it's not an easy job, but when this location has literally no line and still functions like this? C'mon."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2017-11-16,1.0,"Some employees are great, some are incredibly rude, I've seen one snap at the customers for virtually no reason."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2016-08-04,1.0,"Two people waited on me but it took super long to get my pumpkin bread - then they kept asking what I was waiting for, when I was the only one in the store. I waited for my coffee at the bar and then they gave me my coffee with the lid half off so it spilled on the counter. I wouldn't come back to this location."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2015-10-26,4.0,"Idk what all the bad reviews are about?? I spent 4 hours here on a Friday afternoon getting some work done and had no issues at all - my drinks came out at a reasonable time, the noise level was on the lower side for most Starbucks, which I appreciated, and the location was great. 

I did see the issue with the slow staff as I was leaving - near the end when I was actually in a rush to leave, I was picking up a drink for my friend and there was only one other lady in front of me. It took abnormally long for the barista to get the lady her two muffins and drip coffee. But overall, slow service didn't affect my visit until the end."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2015-07-11,1.0,"I would give this place negative stars if I could. First, when I ordered, they never even marked the cups. After waiting 8 minutes, we went back, asked and they realized they made the mistake. Then, it finally hit them that they had run out of what we ordered in the first place. Finally, even when they were making the drinks they did so extremely slowly.

This all happened when there were only 3 customers in the store: can't imagine how bad it is when it's busy!"
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2017-05-12,1.0,UGH! So unsanitary. The guy who was touching the cups where you actually put your mouth if sipping out of the cup had his fingers on his lips moments before and didn't wash his hands. It looked like he was putting some lip balm on. then wiped his hands on his apron and proceeded to touch the cups and equipment. Then he took his own drink and was drinking over other drinks being made .I took my drink but threw it away after I was just too nauseous to actually drink it. The manager needs to train his staff to be more sanitary and was their hands after touching their bodily fluids and spit. GROSS. FAIL. Will never go into that starbucks again!
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2014-12-06,1.0,"Worst and slowest starbucks in Manhattan. I only come here because it is so close to my house. Out of the dozens of times I have been here I never see more than 1 person actually doing something hence the reason it takes you 20-30 minutes to get a coffee when there isn't even a line. 
Don't go here if you don't have to."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2016-01-15,5.0,"I love this Starbucks location! I'm so glad I found it. I started going a different way to work, which is why I found this smaller Starbucks location. This location is actually apart of a Capital One bank branch, but it's a full service Starbucks. The best part is... It's so quick and there's barely a line during rush hour in the morning. I used to wait upwards of 20 minutes at the Starbucks literally one block away and my drink was just mediocre there. At this location everything comes out perfect because they actually listen and have the time to craft your drink. This is my new go to location on the way to work! It's truly a lifesaver."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2016-01-03,2.0,Quality is uniformly Starbucks but this location is particularly understaffed. Also they put the chairs on the tables for closing time an hour before closing. Staff seem overworked.
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2015-07-20,2.0,"Let me preface by adding my own embarrassment to the equation: I am a gold Starbucks member and lover of all things coffee. Where I lived in Los Angeles prior to my New York move had a Starbucks on the first floor. A major perk in my book. 

If this Starbucks and its staff were located on my first floor however, I'd be working hard to have them evicted.

They have the weakest customer service of any Starbucks I've attended. Which says a lot given that the New York standard of customer service is already abysmal. 

You're charging five dollars for coffee? I know I pay it. The product isn't worth it, the convenience and service generally is. But treating your clientele with disrespect simply isn't the business model on which this company initially found success.

In a city this rough and tumble I hate to wish anyone out of a job. My sincerest hope, for my new neighborhood Starbucks is that either management takes the time to train their staff, no matter how difficult the prospect, or someone with more company clout simply starts again at this location. 

As a reminder Starbucks, the prices are high because the service is good. When the service isn't good, suddenly the coffee just isn't worth it."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2015-05-06,1.0,"This Starbucks needs attention from corporate. It is painfully slow, almost always out of ingredients and its drinks don't taste as consistent. Sad when I'm willing to walk a few blocks to a different location."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2011-02-22,4.0,"Being sandwiched between a subway station and a pile of office buildings, this Starbucks is almost always crowded.  It's a relatively large Starbucks, which in the city can range from holes in the wall to grand stores.  This one has plent of seating and can accomodate about twenty or so people easily.  There is a large area leading up to the cashiers since lines form here quickly.

However, just as quickly as those lines form, they disappear just as quick.  The staff has a great system down, keeping the flow going as they chatter into headsets to transmit their orders from one side of the bar to the other.  The efficiency is definitely to be admired!

I've ordered a variety of drinks from here including green tea lattes (one of my favorites) and they always taste fantastic.  They're also always neatly organized and well stocked (something not all Starbucks can claim).

Add to all this that this is right at the base of my office building and I'm definitely a fan!"
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2015-08-25,4.0,I love going to this starbucks cause it is less crowded and staff give an excellent service .I always get  my hot caramel venti latte with soy milk  :).Its practical for me cause its connected with one my favorite bank capitalone :)
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2016-10-29,1.0,"Avoid on weekends! Come here on my way to work and am a gold member who spends thousands every year on their drinks, but on the weekend their barista is rude and stingy! I'm allergic to milk and even when I pay for soy (they don't make me on weekdays--only weekends) they refuse to give me more than a thimble-full! The barista rolled his eyes at me this morning when I asked why the weekday baristas give me as much soy as I like and he goes, ""bc they feel like it and I don't."" Umm, manager? Howard Schultz? Dunkin and their new decent cold brew is right around the corner..."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2016-01-20,1.0,"This used to be my go to Starbucks but not after today. First off they don't mark the cups. I ordered a nonfat caramel macchiato. I was given a caramel macchiato made with 2% milk. When I told the barista that my drink was not correct, she threw the drink in the trash quite angrily and made me another drink. This time she made me a latte. Again not the correct drink, and I had to ask her to dump some caramel into the drink because I couldn't deal with the stupidity any longer. For the record, I kept my receipt and it has my correct order on it, a nonfat caramel macchiato. I understand that mistakes happen, but you guys need to be a little more gracious when dealing with them, especially when they are your mistakes and not the customers."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2014-06-08,1.0,"Counter help bitchy. Good morning not returned, seemed aggravated I was there. This 3 dollar cup of coffee is paying your wage, you could at least be pleasant. Store not open on time. Food case empty upon opening."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2014-09-05,1.0,I only come to this Starbucks location since it's so close to job. The staff at this location is incredibly rude. There's only one person making the drinking during the AM rush.
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2014-06-11,4.0,This is a good one as far as Starbucks goes. The staff is friendly and efficient. The drip coffee is nice and strong. Soooo much better than the Starbucks on 3rd between 41/42. Did I really just say that???
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2015-03-10,1.0,The worst service. I had to explain my order to the cashier 4 x and now wait close to 10 minutes for drink. People before had to remind the barista what they wanted.
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2013-10-26,2.0,"This Starbucks is partnered with Capital One or something, the sign is co-branded. Perhaps that's why it's substandard, but anyway, I ordered a frapuccino here on two different days, and they got the wrong flavor each time. Not even the same wrong flavor, a different one each time! And the whipped cream is not filled to the top of the cup either like at a good Starbucks. 

When they put down the wrong drink I asked the guy if that was supposed to be mine and he says, I don't know. I offered to take it anyway if it was the wrong one, because frankly they taste almost all the same, but he didn't even know and he just let me take it. What if it was someone else's order? This location doesn't use names so you have no way of knowing if it's your drink they got wrong, or someone else's.

Almost any direction you walk from there are other Starbucks fairly close, skip this one and try almost any other."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2013-08-16,1.0,"You can count on consistency with Starbucks. The quality of food and beverage is always the same, but the service can be miles apart. I stop by this Starbucks only because of convenience and without fail, it is easily the worst run of any I've been to. In the mornings especially,  there are four or five folks behind the counter that have no sense of urgency, can't multitask and cashiers that don't know how to smile.  Not a fan."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2007-12-10,3.0,"1) This location is part of an apparent merger between Starbuck's and North Fork bank, so that both can effectively take over the world.  You won't find it on the store locator on Starbucks' website.  Perhaps this is part of Brain's plan to conquer the world.

2) It is a block up 42nd from the UN, which means civilization is fast approaching the organization charged with supporting civilization.

3) It is the holiday season and I'm using Starbucks at my convenience to satisfy my desires for peppermint lattes.  They do.  And like a one-night stand, soon I'll forget all about them."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2016-02-12,3.0,"i was able to do a little banking and get some starbucks without walking out into the cold and that's just fine with me. the location is on the busy 42nd st right off 2nd ave inside the capital one bank spot. it was kinda weird seeing the capital one bank signage mixed with starbucks logos all over the place but it seems to work , you make a deposit in the bank side and then you slide to the left side and order a cappy or frappe . it's a spacious starbucks which i assume is cause it's part of a bank which is usually large in space and the seating of bland tables and chairs are in abundants. the typical starbucks hot and cold drinks with pastries , bagels , salads, yogurts, etc. i did not hear any boring music but that's fine while i am munching on a blueberry scone and venti decaffeinated cappy . overall a good concept of bank and coffee shop in the same indoor location . the staff were decent enough and did not screw up my order. place is clean and the counter with coffee supplies were filled up nicely . overall it's a good option to do some banking knowing that after you make a deposit you can get your java or tea fix steps away."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2014-03-20,1.0,"One of the few times I have ever been to STARBUCKS.  This place is not far from my job and I had won a STARBUCKS gift cards so I treated my friend to lunch.  Well, the level of rudeness we experienced from the two ""barristers"" was apalling to say the least.  They threw our sandwiches into a bag and the filling and cheese just oozed out into the bag and when we informed them we were told that is all they could do.  We ordered green tea and received peppermint and we did not even bother to tell them for fear of another rude response. There is more that I can mention but it will not get my money back. I am surprised as STARBUCKS is so popular and this one is in the heart of Midtown Manhattan."
1052,starbucks-new-york-444,2009-10-04,5.0,"Coming to this Starbucks is a bit like riding the subway.  If you're wearing a backpack, you should take it off.  You should watch where you swing your purse, and for god's sake, pay attention to what you're doing and get out of the BLEEPIN way when the time comes for people to come in and out!!!!  

Say what you will about the cramped space, the crazy corner-diagonal layout, and the inability of anyone to figure out how to get in or out without making 3 or 4 other people move, this is one of my very favorite Starbucks.  The people are likeable and they get it done."
1053,charlies-grill-manhattan,2020-01-02,5.0,"Best breakfast food truck ever! I come here every day on my way to work. I drink a monster first thing in the morning but it's not until I talk to Charlie and Miguel that I actually wake up and feel ready for my day. Friendly, delicious and fast! 
There is a review on here about how you should get the breakfast quesadilla. I second that. Get it."
1053,charlies-grill-manhattan,2018-08-30,4.0,This food cart is sitting in front of the Oakley Store. Solid BEC sandwich. Bread was fresh and slightly toasty. Bacon was decently crisp. The egg was salted  just perfectly. Overall it was satisfying and good for $4 total. Quick service. Would grab something again from this truck if I just needed a quick bite to eat on the go and if I was in the area.
1053,charlies-grill-manhattan,2018-02-24,4.0,"If you're looking for a quick on-the-go breakfast in Midtown, this is the spot.

Service was friendly, nice, and fast. I came on a rainy day (although at that time it was only sprinkling) and these guys were still out there! Talk about dedication. Luckily for me, this meant no line so I was helped right away and walked away with my food in just a few minutes.

I got a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich. It was really delicious and it wasn't too sloppy with everything falling out, which is a problem I've had with other breakfast sandwiches. Everything stayed in place as I ate it. I'd definitely come here again for a breakfast sandwich or to maybe try one of their wraps."
1053,charlies-grill-manhattan,2019-10-23,4.0,"Best breakfast cart in Midtown, the ""Best Seller"" is big and very good, fast great service from an owner operator."
1053,charlies-grill-manhattan,2019-09-23,5.0,"Best breakfast sandwiches/wraps/platters for a great price. Stop by almost every morning before work for a Charlie's Healthy Special: Egg whites, peppers, onions, turkey on whole wheat toast($5.50). Can't beat it. The breakfast quesadilla is also great."
1053,charlies-grill-manhattan,2018-09-27,5.0,"I eat here all the time, and the bacon egg and avocado sandwich is great! I get it almost every time"
1053,charlies-grill-manhattan,2017-08-23,4.0,Love the bacon egg and cheese on a bagel and their hot coffee. There is usually a line and they aren't there all day.
1053,charlies-grill-manhattan,2017-12-06,4.0,"Very handy to The Roosevelt, if you are looking for something made-to-order and don't really want to do the sit-down thing, highly recommended. I had the chorizo omelet ($5) and it was tasty. Several people walked up who were obviously regulars, so I considered that a good sign. Food carts are probably overlooked by a lot of tourists, but a good one can feed you quickly and economically without sacrificing quality. Charlie's is in that category!"
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2020-03-12,4.0,"I enjoy a good Starbucks drink and food, but I'll be honest.  The thought of going into a Starbucks during the morning rush hour gives me the screaming heebie jeebies.  Usually it is crowded, people are pushing past each other purely out of necessity and there is a chance your order will get stolen (it's happened to me twice).  I almost walked by this Starbucks while walking to my office, but when I glanced over it actually looked fairly calm and civilized inside.  This stopped me dead in my tracks and I hung a quick turn to go inside.

This Starbucks is one of the really nice pretty ones.  It has either been heavily renovated or it was build this way, but the lighting, decor, seating and counter all looked to be in great shape and clean.  Best of all?  It was not mobbed.  Was the staff busy?  Absolutely.  Mobile orders were coming in and they were scrambling to fulfill them.  Meanwhile, only about six customers were at the counter and about a dozen were scattered about in seats enjoying their mornings.  It was a much calmer atmosphere than I have seen at a Starbucks in the morning in quite some time.

The staff was very pleasant and efficient.  They did not give me the hasty ""Get out of my face quickly now please."" treatment.  Instead, they were very calm and relaxed not just with the customers, but with each other.  My order came in under 10 minutes (which is faster than most locations in the AM rush) so I was very pleased.

I am going to aim to go to this location as much as I can before work going forward.  It was a far more pleasant experience than other ones nearby."
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2019-04-23,4.0,"What is there to say about Starbucks? They're mostly all the same but what made this one stand out from the rest is how quickly my drink was prepared during a lunch time rush in NYC. In and out.

Good job guys and the drink tasted great!"
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2019-02-08,1.0,"O-M-G! Reviews said ""fast service"" we'll maybe that's in person because I did a mobile order because I was in a rush. Keep in mind I did the order 20 mins earlier and to my shock & awe when I arrived almost 30 mins later my beverage was still not ready.

Only 1 person working beverages for in house customers and mobile orders. 18 people waiting one employee taking our cash and one employee making 18 beverages. I feel bad for the understaffing but this is NYC. Have staff or close your doors. Oh yea for full disclosure it's 2:45pm when I'm sure this store is not at its peak.

My Frappuccino tasted like ass! I was running late to be back at my office that by the time I realized my beverage was disgusting I just threw it in the garbage. Ugh!!"
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2019-11-22,3.0,If you do mobile ordering for pickup you wait an additional couple of minutes longer than the app says. I have frequently had to wait longer than expected when I arrived for my drink. Not a big Starbucks location but good for grab and go.
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2020-01-31,1.0,"Rude and useless staff is only the start. Any training clearly was wasted on them. Unhygienic. Someone who clearly works there but was not on duty, just jumped behind the counter to serve herself. Without any hesitation she proceeded to handle all the other food without wearing any gloves or hair net, all under the agreeing eye of  the manager."
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2019-07-22,1.0,"A total disaster.  Avoid this location.  They don't have decaf.  They don't have this.  They don't have that.  And if they have it, you get to watch a cashier spend 5 minutes trying to ring it up.   This location Needs help."
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2017-03-25,5.0,"Gorgeous new Bux in an area that surprisingly has less Buxes than you think. While this is spot is new, the employees are top of their game. The customer service, cleanliness and products are all great.

This is a great Bux to work from ""home"" at or ""work"" from"" home"" however you look at it. It has two coded restrooms. It also has seating at the counter, so you can watch and chat with the barista making your drink. They're so friendly, it gives it a neighborhood bar-type feel. But more wholesome."
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2019-10-24,1.0,Couldn't imagine this location could be any worse. Apparently now they don't even take mobile orders. And unfortunately this is the only location in a radius of a few blocks from where I live. Why don't you take mobile orders in the mornings?????
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2019-06-26,1.0,"This Starbucks is horrible. The barista yelled at me for asking about my drinking that I ordered in app which came up as not sold at this store after I had already paid for it. ""SO GO GET A REFUND"" I then went to the cashier who said that they didn't make it because they ran out of salt for the salted sweet cream cold brew. Very simple solution, the barista could have just asked if I would have it without salt or wanted a different drink in supplement. The only reason I go here is because it is by my office. Otherwise everyone at this store needs an attitude check."

1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2017-04-25,4.0,"I'm not a big fan of Starbuck's, but out of the 5 or 6 Starbuck's within 2 blocks of my work, this is the newest and best one.  

The design is very spacious and for some reason, it's always empty every time I go.  I don't particularly like their coffee, but I like to chase their reward stars and I inevitably end up getting their Zesty Chicken with Black Bean salad as my reward.  Most locations seem to run out pretty quickly since they don't stock many and I've gone to this location about 3 times after visiting a closer one first to find it.  

If you're one of those people that stays in a Starbucks the whole day working, this is a good location for you.  It's pretty empty and quiet.

Also the workers seem nicer than the typical Starbuck's worker. Maybe because they haven't gotten jaded yet. LOL."

-Plenty of seating
-HAS a bathroom (for you small bladder-ed people)
-Great music selection, providing a great atmosphere
-Giant front pick up counter where mobile orders are VERY easy to access. 

One of the more efficient Starbucks locations that you'll see."
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2018-05-31,4.0,"Excellent Starbucks.   Lines are usually long in the morning, but the staff keep it moving quickly.  Lots of people, mostly professional from all the corporate buildings in the area.  Always make a great ""flat white"" for me."
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2017-02-21,4.0,"Brand new Starbucks on the block, and boy is this one spacious. Tall windows and wall-length murals really sell the idea, and it's just plain larger than other local locations. However, this only translates to slightly more seating space than usual, and in this neighborhood I expect a constantly packed house.

The place is clean as a whistle and orderly as a drill team, but we'll see if it looks that way in a month after the new Starbucks smell wears off. Food/drink quality was Starbucks standard, which is really all one can ask for. Service was a bit slow, I imagine that can be chalked up to newness and getting the kinks out. Very friendly though - while I don't come to Starbucks for the banter, it never hurts."
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2018-11-20,1.0,"Worst service ever.  Just went in, placed my order, waited 15 minutes while everyone behind me got their drinks.  Asked about mine multiple times.  Kept being told it was being worked on.  Finally requested a refund, then they said my drink was ready and handed it to me as I left.  Completely wrong order.  Never going to this location again.  I've never seen such a disorganized Starbucks."
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2019-04-03,1.0,"Orders are consistently wrong and service moves at a snail's pace.

I had to meet a colleague to work on a project for a few hours, and this was a perfect location for meeting. The place is clean, everything is in perfect shape there and the staff did a great job. It was nice and quiet with very little activity, so it was easy to spread out and get some work done. Due to its newness and people may not be aware of this Starbuck's yet. Overall, I recommend this location."
1054,starbucks-new-york-503,2017-08-21,1.0,"This is the worst Starbucks. Both times I mobile ordered and got there and waited over 15 minutes for my coffee and had to ask for it multiple times. This morning the same thing happened (making me late for work again) and I Finally said please I'm late for work and have been waiting here 15 minutes and the woman working there was rude and yelled at me saying "" I already made your drink"". There was a coffee by where the people who come in to purchase drinks is but without a label. She saw me standing by the mobile order pickup, inquiring about it several times, and never even called my name when she made this coffee. She also made my drink wrong. Yet somehow I was supposed to know the coffee on the other side where incoming customers was mine and she gave me attitude like I was stupid. She's unprofessional, needs a lesson in customer service, and I'm never coming back to this Starbucks ever again."
1055,starbucks-new-york-318,2017-05-04,5.0,"If you're looking for a regular coffee place to get a consistent, fast drink, this is the place for you.  Now with to-go orders, I can order my drink while on the subway and pick it up before I go to the office.

I am always so impressed at this Starbucks by the level of speed and accuracy with which they work.  Of course, there are occasional problems with people's drinks, but for the most part, I see hard work and consistency all around.  In the morning, when they're busiest, I am always able to get my drink in less than five minutes.  And who can complain about that.  

On top of that, my drink is ALWAYS accurate.  They are careful to make sure they hear and enter your drink correctly, so there are as few mistakes as possible.  

Since the app has started allowing you to order ahead, it's become even easier for me to grab my drink on the fly.  Why wait when I can just pop in and go?  I've started doing it so consistently that some of the people who work the to-go station have started recognizing me and grabbing my drink before I even say anything.  Love that service!  

They also have plenty of space to sit if you need a quick break from the hustle and bustle of Midtown.  Free wifi plus great pastries make Starbucks a fantastic place to meet friends or business associates for a quick coffee and catch-up.  

See you guys tomorrow!"
1055,starbucks-new-york-318,2019-10-16,2.0,"Hoping to grab a coffee before getting the subway nearby to JFK where I'd fly home to Manchester (sadly) after a great long stay in NYC - I called at Starbucks on 515 Madison, it is a pretty small store and it can get really busy at times and quite hard to find a seat - they could literally be gone in minutes.

This store offers UberEATS and mobile orders, sadly as a UK customer, I couldn't use mobile ordering as I'm only able to use my Starbucks card to pay and acquire one star per transaction as I would back home meaning I can't enjoy and take advantage of my Gold benefits I would back home.

I ordered one of my favourite Starbucks drinks at Starbucks in the US - a Venti Iced Caramel Cloud Macchiato which is made with an egg-white foam, the drink was pretty good however I would have liked a slight touch more of espresso to give it a stronger rather than sweeter taste.

It isn't the most comfortable Starbucks as it is pretty narrow and the staff aren't overly friendly, the selection of merchandise also was pretty poor meaning I'd have to go into another store on my way to the subway to get souvenirs before heading home which was a little inconvenient. 

Pricing as with US Starbucks and NYC (both tend to be high) go hand in hand - my drink after tax came to $6.48, this would also be the price of the regular version or PSL which costs around 1.6 dollars more when converted here, compared to back home.

2* - Drink was just okay in not very comfortable surroundings and many other nearby branches just a block or two away are larger and more welcoming in size, features and service. This branch probably deserves the title of ""Worst Spelling of the name Aaron"", even the barista making my drink looked at confusion and laughter as she had to shout out ""Salin"" - now I thought ""Simon"" or ""Alvin"" couldn't get any worse!"

Orders were stacking up, but the staff was working SO hard to make sure all of the customers were being served in a timely manner, correctly, and respectfully. They could have easily been rude or whatever, but everyone I associated with (and saw associating with other customers) was incredibly accommodating. Awesome experience, even if I did have to wait a little."
1055,starbucks-new-york-318,2018-09-19,5.0,Nice Starbucks with seating and outlets. It's a smaller Starbucks and can get crowded with a medium sized line. I was able to work here.
1055,starbucks-new-york-318,2017-11-22,1.0,"In the age of bullet trains and same day delivery options on Amazon, why oh  why does it take 14 minutes for this location to make my coffee?

Today wasn't the first time this happened but it will be my last. When I'm short for time, MOST other Starbucks are good with speed. I even know the hacks like, just grab a drip coffee when you gotta go, or don't let them add milk because for some perplexing reason, this adds at least 3 minutes to your order time. 

This location is always crowded in the mornings so I try to go slightly after the 3pm rush for a pick me up coffee. The three different times I've tried this, I've waited for no shorter than 14 minutes each time. This time, I counted 4 behind the counter - and one slowly, begrudgingly cleaning off the not-really-that-dirty milk counter. I'll get back to this person later.

So as I stand there, there are like 30 mobile orders called, none of which are picked up. There are only 3 people in line waiting for their physical in real life order to be made and we all stand there for like 7 minutes. Then a barista behind the bar starts inexplicably organizing metal trays -as slowly as she possibly could. Look I get it, sometimes it's not fun to work but don't let the customers see it.

Lastly, when I get my drink 14 minutes later, I get no apology but probably because I have resting nice face and they don't realize I want to set the place on fire. 

And remember the Begrudging Barista from earlier?  Well I finally go over to finish off my drink and she moves away from where I am and stands impatiently behind me and even looks over to a barista behind the counter like I won't notice. I'm a pretty confrontational person but the most I did was shake my head at the two of them and write this snarky review. Not trying to get anyone fired but have some common sense. And also, make our coffee faster. Zero stars."

Considering the calorie intake, I only had the tall cup, and asked for nonfat version as well. It was still a bit sweet to me, however I liked it a lot. The toasted flavor stayed. Would strongly recommend this latte to whoever is a big fan of cookies."

- The entrance is located on 53rd not Madison which confused me
- This Starbucks is really cute. This is a new location so I'm not sure if Starbucks is updating its look and feel but the interior looked more like a cute little cafe (and not a Starbucks)
- It's one of the last busy Starbucks I've been to in Manhattan and they are quite speedy"

She was incredibly demeaning and condescending I'm appalled that I was treated this way by someone out of no where. After I was finished she just stared at me until I had to ask her if I was done and then she turns away asking for the next person on line with a smirk on her face as if she was trying to be the most b***** she could possible be.

To my pleasant surprise I was in and out within a couple minutes. The staff is friendly, enthusiastic and attentive. They cater to my annoying requests without the attitude that we've all encountered before at a Starbucks. It's a clover store too so the quality of your coffee is pretty top notch.

1055,starbucks-new-york-318,2017-01-13,1.0,Very bad customer at this particular store. Went to them yesterday morning for some oatmeal and tea and a protein pack. I asked for a shopping bag to carry my food since it was a take out order. The cashier stated I may not anymore bags. I asked can he check.  He made an attempt to act like he looked for one. I then asked were there any in the back. He then stated I don't think so. He then he yelled out to the Manager Barbara asking were there any bags. She then was rude in answering if you don't see any then there is none!  She didn't even attempt to look in the back. So I asked so I'm to walk outside in the street with a cup of oatmeal and the protein pack and a cup of tea. The manager then snapped back to me saying I don't have any bags. I was so surprised of the bad customer service that was happening and another customer that was in the store also commented that was rude. To think that this brand would not have supplies in there store and to make sure your customers are happy. On top of this whole  situation I have a Aunt who works for the corporate office of Starbucks and who deals directly with Mr Schultz each day.  I know that I will not return back to this particular store due to the disrespect of the manager who should set the example for her team.  It's a shame. I'm also going on my social media channels to let people know about this store and the bad service they do there.

It's the biggest one I've ever been in and the people who work there are really nice. I didn't have any trouble finding a place to sit quietly by myself (I don't like sitting with strangers, I find it a bit creepy) and drink my white mocha. And I didn't get that rushed vibe that you'd usually get in starbucks (you know, where you feel like you're being judged for taking up space that other people are waiting for). Instead, I was able to enjoy my drink in peace. The drink itself was the best white mocha I've had so far ~ not too sweet, just the way I like it. I don't drink coffee and I'm dairy-free now, but otherwise I wouldn't mind coming here again."
1055,starbucks-new-york-318,2016-09-13,1.0,Horrible service. I used to go here once in a while and they always give me one tea bag instead of two in the medium sized tea. I have to remind them that the Grande comes with two teabags....

So I decided to walk in and see if it lives up to its expectations! The sandwich selection was phenomenal with each sandwich having all of its ingredients listed right next to its name. 
I decided to get the California Club which had pieces of roasted turkey breast (antibiotic free) topped with a sliced cage-free hard boiled egg, avocado, tomatoes, mesclun, and cilantro lime yogurt sauce on a 9 grain bread. Hands down this was one of the best sandwiches I had in a while! It seemed as this sandwich was just made and I stared eating it right away. All of the ingredients were fresh and delicious. I also got a cup of regular coffee which was little cold but good none the less. Overall I was very satisfied with my food and shopping experience there. 
I would definitely recommend going there for lunch and I'm coming back for more!

I ordered a large iced latte with skim milk. When I got my order, it was a black iced coffee. I wouldn't have cared except I thought I paid for the latte. I kindly explained I ordered a latte and the employee rolled her eyes and began making my correct order. The employee who rung me up rudely called me over and explained that I certainly did not say I wanted a latte-and would have to pay the difference. I knew 100% I said latte-but I told the cashier that I was tired and maybe I did say coffee. I apologized and agreed that of course I would pay the difference.

The cashier and her coworker couldn't figure out how to make me pay the difference for several minutes. The whole time saying things under her breath about me to her coworker. After they explained they could not figure it out on the register-I offered to just pay for the new drink in full (that would be a total payment of two drinks-one of which was incorrect). She rudely told me that what I said was ridiculous and gave me my correct order with another eye roll. 

I was being extremely nice and understanding the entire ordeal, but felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed at the hands of the cashier. I will unfortunately have to find another place to get my morning coffee."

She helped me, but again no frills, just the same ""you're not welcomed here"" look as before.

That being said they have 1/2 the shelf space so if you are craving something special such as the seemingly very elusive Roast Beef, Parmesan, Arugula, Horseradish baguette, this location is NOT going to cut it, not even diagonally. (Go to the bigger Park location for that.)

They have the very basic sammiches, coffee, & soups at this location.

Service is always top notch, pricey but uber convenient and fresh."

The staff always makes sure I have a place to sit.  (Note, those high chairs and tables are the least-disability friendly things.)  So for the staff to go out of their way to make sure that I get a place at every visit, is amazing."
1056,pret-a-manger-new-york-30,2015-11-12,1.0,"I wish there was a way to not leave any stars for this establishment. My co-worker comes back to the office livid about an exchange that he has had at this coffee house. He says that when he asked the worker to replace a cold coffee for a hot one he was told to ""GET OUT OF HIS FACE"". How can this be called customer service? We do our jobs day in and day out to deliver service to millions of people at our company and we do it with a smile. We don't expect to be treated this way in a place that we go to exhale. I think that the way that my co-worker was treated was beeeyyooonnndddd disrespectful. This company needs to work on training their employees better and put more effort in to whom they hire instead of just adding people with not one ounce of home training to their staff. Please do better! Thanks:)"

I do know this, though: their Tuna Nicoise salad is simply amazing. Super fresh, with the perfect combination of ingredients: cucumbers, tomato, capers, kalamata olives, and really tasty, hearty chunks of albacore tuna. Definitely not your watery-just-dumped-from-a-can stuff. It's probably the freshest, healthiest, most feel-good-satisfying prepared lunches out there. All under $9, tax included. 

The other options looks pretty good, as well, particularly the other salads and the Skinny Gazpacho, and the coffee seems like it's worth a shot. Not the spot to have a seated lunch with a friend, but a great bet for a grab n' go that won't put you into a food coma later."

And the music is unnecessarily loud. The customers next table have to yell at each other in order to have a conversation. Who manages this store? I took a coke right out of the fridge and it was near lukewarm. Ever tasted lukewarm coke? The loud music is somewhat understandable, but the heat? In a 90 degree weather? Is it a new way to drive customers away? Or does the manager have some kind of medical issues that requires him/her to stay in a environment with over 100 degree temperature?"

Even cashier machine will definitely say thank you. Will consider to go back to this place.

Food: GREAT! I have had most of their soups and I am addicted to the Moroccan Lentil Soup.  It is so great.  I recommend that everyone try it!!

I love PRET's business model; giving their consumers fresh food daily and being as socially conscious as they are....their Moroccan lentil soup is a super added bonus.  What a great place for lunch!"

1056,pret-a-manger-new-york-30,2011-10-18,5.0,"Fresh and delicious. I like their Vietnamese sandwich and summer salad crunchy wrap, and shrimp cilantro wrap. Salad wrap has lots of veggies including beets and hummus! LOVE.

Most baguette sandwiches are on the slightly carb-heavy side. 

For salad, chicken avocado is my default choice - simply the best source for protein.

Afternoon snack, they've got a wide array of ""cups of goodness"". When I crave for carb as afternoon tea, my default choice would be plain croissant plus skim mocha. 
Pret serves the best croissant among all the coffee shops. (Trust me, I've tried them all, big big croissant fan here)

These sort of sandwich shops are equivalent to Starbucks in the coffeeshop category: pay the slight premium for the quality food and service. Definitely worth it!"
1056,pret-a-manger-new-york-30,2012-10-30,4.0,"I love Pret for their fresh products and great service.   This particular location is a little smaller than others in terms of selection, but I've never been disappointed with the lunch I bought.  The great thing about Pret in general is that their sandwiches are very consistent.  I'm a sucker for their Egg Salad & Arugula sandwich. Each one is made with equally fresh ingredients and with a high degree of quality.  

The staff at this location are really friendly, and very efficient at making the line move quickly.  Even during hectic lunch hours, the wait is never long.  If you're looking to dine in you may have trouble finding a table during busier times, but it's great for grabbing a quick sandwich on the go."

On the other hand, I got the worst cup of coffee I've had in ages here. Horribly stale, so stale in fact, that it tasted like I bit into a filterless Camel. Blech."
1056,pret-a-manger-new-york-30,2011-02-02,5.0,"I have visited this Pret for more than 5 times. Everytime I dine in this place, the entrees came out the way I expected it to come out yet also exceeds my expectations. The Pret drinks and coffees came out excellent as well. 

I also love the young and clean atmosphere, organized yet stylish and friendly customer service. The only disappointment is a lack of restroom but that is fine if you are grabbing it on the go or for a quick dining in session. But, if you do need a restroom, check out the other Pret @ 54th and Lex one block down which has a nice one."

But, I will say this: The service at this Pret is AMAZING.  The staff is SUPER super sweet.  I have never left that place feeling like I was given the cold shoulder (or a cold sandwich, as I frequently order their heated sandwiches).  

Additionally, I find it EXTREMELY heart-warming that they donate their leftovers to charity organizations at the end of the day.  I love a business that is altruistic and doesn't waste product.  

In terms of food, the items available are always VERY fresh.  Sandwiches, sushi, soups, salad -- everything is simple and delightful.  I also thoroughly enjoy their fresh juices and ""love bite"" dessert items.  The eatery is also CRAZY clean.  Overall, a very enjoyable experience!"
1056,pret-a-manger-new-york-30,2012-02-05,4.0,"I love the Pret chain for the fresh, healthy options and the consciousness about waste (we need this kind of place in NYC!), but the selection at this location is worsening, and many salads have disappeared.  Maybe it's because my time to visit is late in the day, but still."

The food is delicious, fresh, and very reasonably priced. Also, the coffee is delicious and on the coffee prep table (milk, sugar, etc.), soy milk is one of the available choices. In addition to salads, hot and cold sandwiches, there are four or five soups daily. The two we tried (chicken noodle, morrocan lentil) were superb and very filling.

Service was great, place clean, and pleasant sitting area."

I usually pick me up a breakfast sandwich or a grilled hot dog and a BIG GULP. Today is July 11th, which is 7-Eleven's namesake. On this particular date once every year, they hand out free Slushees at all of their locations. Naturally I came in to get my free Slushee, and already there was a line out the door with kids and parents lining up. I choose an Orange flavored Slushee. I also purchased a Super Big grilled hot dog, in the largest size they have and added cheese and diced tomatoes to it."

At the end of the day I get different times at every 7/11 of what time the lottery closes for paying out. Last night I did one at 2am nearby and this guy says 7-7? For a Times Square location??? I'm def going to avoid this 7/11 like the plague but was at least hoping for a straight answer. 

Thanks"

The cashiers were nice and quick, but unfortunately the prices weren't very good. Also something that detracted from this place was that there were vagrants hanging outside trying to get money from you for opening the door. I found that they sometimes will get a bit nasty if you don't give them anything. I'll probably go to a nearby CVS or Duane Reade for better prices."
1057,7-eleven-new-york-2,2015-06-09,5.0,Always in here when i have to work. Love the prices & how clean it is. One of the few places to have pina colada & banana flavor slurpees. Thats about it. If u been to a 7 11 then u already know what to expect. If u havent u need to go

They really impressed me so I'm doing this review.

My experience has always been good here for the past year. Whether I'm traveling or just on my lunch break.

Like, it's nice to know that whatever time I'm craving coffee or snacks; I can just walk into this 7 Eleven and it will be supplied or the manager makes accommodations, if a particular item is out of stock.

Especially, the cappuccino machine and the breakfast items."
1057,7-eleven-new-york-2,2014-02-10,4.0,I hate 7-11 because I feel they're invading Manhattan at the expense of our favorite mom and pop corner delis. I love 7-11 because they have hot dogs with unlimited chili and cheese. Did I say UNLIMITED?  Fill up your dog to your heart's content. They won't yell at you for doing it. That and God bless Slurpees. Just be careful ordering mini-tacos at 4am. 4 for $0.99 sounds tempting but I advise you do a quality check and eat one before leaving.  You could get an old dry stale batch that crumbles into sawdust in your mouth. I think this happened at least 2 times. Damn heat lamp...and who doesn't love the giant sized microwave $2 beef and cheese burrito? Nuke it at home for a post drinking heavenly experience with your $3 nachos doused in unlimited chili cheese. Did I mention UNLIMITED?

Wasn't skeptical enough to pass it up though :/ It was pretty good to be many hours old. I also had my favorite monterey jack & chicken taquito."

I got a Slurpee -- for some reason only one flavor was available, the others were sold out I guess.

And I got nachos -- the chips were stale (even though they came sealed in a plastic bag, who knows for how long), the salsa was sugary, and jalapenos weren't spicy, and for some reason they were out of chili AND nacho cheese so I had to wait a few minutes for them to restock.

And I got a donut, which was okay.

I prefer the location on 23rd street off Park Avenue."
1057,7-eleven-new-york-2,2007-07-03,4.0,"after being kinda disappointed over not getting tickets for Shakespeare in the Park, I needed to go somewhere to drown my sorrow. Having remembered that they transformed this branch into a Kwik-E-Mart to promote ""The Simpsons Movie"" i took the N train from the village to Times Square and walked on over here.

Look at the pix, pardner, and drool, drool, drool. Yes, it is sort of Kwik-E-Mart, with Buzz Cola, Krusty O's cereal and Squishees. Unfortunately they were out of Krusty O's but I did get a can of Buzz Cola.

But lets face it, underneath the sheer veneer its still a friggin' 7-Eleven.   So its good for getting a 200 oz. soda and a hot dog at 2am in the middle of Times Square. But for now, i'll relish in the fact that Apu's Kwik-E-Mart really exists."

1057,7-eleven-new-york-2,2012-06-02,3.0,"A little bigger than some 7-Elevens but it's your basic chain.

I've not had their food but the selection here is pretty good & cheap.  We mostly come here for the Slurpees, which are usually tasty & they do change the flavors from time to time."

Sure I'll take that.... lol they have a coffee selection as well as cappuccino and hit chocolate machine all at the same price. Slurpees!!!! Lol grab a big gulp, fountain soda for less. They also have an amazon pick up center inside and an atm and lotto, we all have that dream! The problem is there is always a homeless/alcoholic/drug addict etc. Trying to swindle you out of the dollar you need to invest in that dream! I dont look down on them but it's pretty out of hand... they camp out there being that there is a church on one side and inpatient rehab center on the other side.... right across from port authority and up the block from times square. Its a 711 . Growing up we only knew 711 existed because they had commercial but none in the city. Its a chain bodega lol"

Right outside the Port Authority, you can stop here for a Slurpee, Big Bite hot dog, or wings... I actually like the wings here quite a bit, and they are relatively cheap (12 for $6).

Friendly, but not particularly fast."

Finally, when it comes to drunk grazing, this store can't be beat.  Nachos at 4am?  I SAY AMEN!"
1057,7-eleven-new-york-2,2011-07-26,4.0,"7-eleven, what can I say?
- a place to go where you are on the road travelling to get a big bite hot dog with everything on it, but also the famous home of the Slurpee.  Mostly people love those it is true. I just came here recently, had the coupon for free Fruit cup from Village Voice.  Strawberry/Blueberry mix was on point, especially for free, normal price is about $3.49.  I would go back to get the fruit cup and of course a slurpree though next time. Village Voice also has a coupon for free slice of pizza, check that out.

-Definitely a good spot to go to. Workers here were friendlier than other 7-Eleven locations that I have been to.

*It has been a while actually since I had a regular slurpee here, only get the Pizza recently and $1 per piece Chicken Tenders."

Have you ever played that old Nintendo game ""Bart Simpson vs. the Space Mutants""?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrWOXpbm9-0&mode=related&search=

Today, after dodging all the tourist mutants on Times Sq. I made my way to Kwik-E-Mart safe and sound, to partake on a little of Simpsons madness; I entered the famed Springfield establishment, finding a bunch of New Yorkers, giddy as children, taking pictures and buying items only thought to exist in the mind of Matt Groening. 

The employees sported Apu's famed store costume as well as his regional ethnicity (all were of middle eastern descent), an ATM for the First Bank of Springfield was at hand (see picture), Maggie Simpson favorite cereal, Krusty O's was lined up in the racks, Buzz Cola was available at the freezer (and it was sold out in the blink of an eye), and finally, the decadent Squishee was there in an array of flavors...  All this Simpsoniana made me somewhat dizzy, to the point that I thought I was imagining yelper Pam S. standing in front of me, waiting in line for her own Squishee.... ""Excuse me, are you a Yelper?"" -I muttered, and  thus she confirmed that she was not a figment of Matt Groening's imagination, but a true Yelper in the flesh. I served myself a large Pina Colada + Mountain Dew Squishee, and talked to Pam S. and her BF; they were too, taking pictures, so I didn't felt that bad for being the only Yelp addict doing so... 

After they had left, I decided to stay for a bit, and what the heck, eat a Blimpie 1/4 pound hot dog while at it... suddenly, a kid was caught shoplifting and one of the employees started yelling ""Call the cops! Call the cops!"" That was my cue that it was time to go. 

As I left Kwik-E-Mart, a question popped into my mind; ""Is life stranger than fiction?"" -Only in New York; I think."

Be warned though.. due to the high turnover rates at this location (the only full-blown converted one in NY), the squishee/slurpees are super watery and syrupy. Kinda gross.

I brought my Burger Dog over to the condiments area, threw on some fresh diced tomatoes, spritzed on some ketchup along with a squirt of mustard, and I was ready to rock out.

I'm not gonna lie; it tasted good, and it was filling. It doesn't look big, but the cross-section is wide all around. It barely fit it in my mouth, just barely. And, for $2.17, it's not a bad deal either.

Basically, it's ground burger patty with chunks of cheddar mixed in, and rolled into the shape of a hot dog. Thinking back on it though, something about the look just doesn't quite sit right with me; long, brown, and shaped like a log? Hmm..

Beauty, indeed, is in the eye of the beholder, so I'd go back for seconds. Next time, I'll snatch up two, and see if I can cram them both into my stomach!"

He wasn't very good either. I ordered a panini sandwich, and I asked for it to be warmed up. The cashier took my sandwich and tried to lateral pass the sandwich onto the counter behind him. Of course, he did a really poor job at pretending he was good at passing and missed the counter by a few feet. As luck would have it, my sandwich landed on the floor. Did he go to pick it up? No. He finished ringing me up and going on to the next customer. Finally, it was picked up. 

I also ordered a Venti iced tea, unsweetened,  with light water. I find that if I don't ask for light water, Starbucks, AND ONLY STARBUCKS, gives me an expensive glass of light colored water without any tea taste. 

At this store, my drink order went about the same. There was no iced tea left and they had to make more. The barista, didn't seem to know how to brew more tea. After a little coaching, the tea was made, but since it was taking so long, the guy was forgetting to make my tea order even though the Venti cup was staring him in his face. 

I guess I was looking slightly annoyed, and he finally realized that I didn't have my iced tea. So he made it with,of course, with too much water. Tired of waiting, I took and tasted the colored water, the stuff they call premium tea, and dumped most of it in the trash.

This was not the best experience in a Starbucks."

In any case, I came in the afternoon (The breakfast/pre-work rush is INSANE) so there were both seats available and a much, much shorter line.  Thus, I got good service, and was even able to use the rest room (a luxury in NYC), which was fairly clean.

SO happy for a safe warm space to pee and get a hot cup of expensive-ass coffee."
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2019-08-01,2.0,"Hey tourists, you want a busy Starbucks experience as seen in the movies?? Go to this location during the morning rush hour. The madness isn't in the register line, it is MOBILE ORDERS. 

Very high volume store (they absolutely hit their sales quotas). Most certainly one of the smaller stores in Manhattan.  

Word to the wise, Starbucks@425Lex, please find ways to better improve the mobile app processes (if possible)!"
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2019-01-16,3.0,"This is consistently one of the least efficient Starbucks I frequent. For a Starbucks located directly across from grand central, it cannot handle the morning rush.  Drink quality depends on the person behind the bar and more than once I've waited an inordinate amount of time for an espresso drink with only a faint hint of coffee. 
From now on I'd rather walk the extra avenue to go to another."
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2018-01-12,3.0,"Located across the street from Grand Central Terminal, you can imagine the morning crowd that comes stumbling into this particular Starbucks location. Unfortunately, the morning crew doesn't know how to manage a morning rush. I've waited over 15 minutes once just for a toasted bagel. 

If you're anything like me and constantly running on scheduled time, this isn't the place for you to stop in the morning. The afternoon might not be so bad. I will say that the staff is pretty friendly, but friendly doesn't get you to work on time."
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2018-10-26,4.0,"This place is pretty crowded, but it has gorgeous views. My drink was perfect. The bathrooms are clean, it's not too small. I was able to find a seat which is nice, except there were only wireless chargers at the open seat so I had to wait for another seat to open up where I could charge my phone. Waiting in the window wasn't bad because the view of the Chrysler building is nice. I felt comfortable and cozy here, how a coffee house should feel. A nice warm break from the city. A good place to  recharge in all ways."
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2019-12-24,1.0,"I was treated rudely by another customer in Starbucks.  The staff refused to do anything.  I was frankly stunned by what I had experienced.  Goodby, Starbucks!  I have read and heard other stories and this confirmed what I had read:  staff inept."
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2017-08-12,1.0,"Came here for a frapiccinos Saturday morning 8 am not lines thought it would be great. Well they don't know how to make coffee, the woman infront of me Was complaining about simple coffee with milk in it. Seems they need life lessons on coffee making. Then I went to order, and frapiccinos are is advertised all over this place. They told me they don't make s'mores or caramel frapiccinos it's only in big bold letter on the menu. I guess they don't know the menu either. It's one thing to not know how to make coffee but to not know what's on the wall behind you, words can't explain. 
Don't come to this one theirs a few around this area, I'm sure you can find something better."
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2019-08-11,5.0,Great staff and great music playlist. Why isn't my local Starbucks playing music like this? I will always stop here before hitting grand central.
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2018-11-27,3.0,Dont read this and be turned away however I prefer dunking doughnuts.... they did not make me a very good ice coffee.. still the customer service was good... just I'm more of a  fan of dunkin doughnuts
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2018-08-23,5.0,I love coming to this Starbucks before heading into the office. The baristas and staff move so fast to get the orders completed in a timely fashion. Plus I love the music in the morning. #vibesallday
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2015-08-05,5.0,I pass by a few Starbucks just to go to this location. The coffee execution just seems to be done better here. The store is clean despite heavy traffic and the speed at which you get through the line is also impressive. It's a well oiled machine. The baristas are great and counter service is friendly. Carolyn and Denise know names and orders by heart. 5 stars
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2018-08-06,1.0,Literally the worst starbucks ive ever been too. The girls ate very impatient and rather snarky. And my espresso was very burnt tasting. Im assuming the machine over pulls the shots. Very bad!
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2018-05-28,5.0,"The workers at this Starbucks are the best. They go above and beyond expectations to help their customers. One worker whose name escapes me, but begins with a K, is amazing. She deserves a raise!"
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2017-08-19,5.0,One of the good Starbucks places to go. People that work there late in the day are pretty friendly. My drink was made perfect just the way I like it.
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2016-11-18,1.0,"I come here a lot of times before going to work- but I can't take it anymore all the time i come here, im waiting more that 13mins for a caramel frap that I paid and never being made!!! How is that possible??!!! All the time i have to ask them for my frap!!!!and they have to ask again what did i order... This is the first time I signed up at yelp just to give a review in this place! I just got very very bad service and that very unforgettable and not acceptable!!!"
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2017-11-10,5.0,"From reading the reviews on here you would think this is the worst Starbucks ever. I actually had a good experience. The store is very clean and the customer service was great. The staff was very greeting.  I ordered two drinks and they got everything right. They asked about how my day was, they asked how to spell my name, and they moved at a great pace. I would definitely return here."
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2018-02-14,1.0,"I usually have a pleasant experience at this starbucks. Will probably not go back however. I cannot have milk and have had issues in the past where starbucks have used milk on a soy order so I like to watch to make sure. I watched the barista use regular milk in my coffee. I tasted it- multiple times. Enough to begin to feel sick (it doesnt take long) before asking for a new one. The person at the register was nice about it but i watched the barista roll her eyes and say something snarky. Ok, fine. It may have been annoying to her- whatever. But then she made a point to locate me in the store, make eye contact and glare at me for a good amount of time. She refused to hand the cup to me and had someone else hand it off who was also rude about the hand off. 

I'm not a high maintenance person but I also go to an establishment where i pay $5 for a friggin coffee so I expect my order to be correct especially when I have an allergy."
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2018-01-24,2.0,"I'm actually relieved to see this location with accurate reviews. People should know that this location is always slow and the employees are usually indifferent to their delivery of subpar service. I hate to be dramatic, but I've given this Starbucks so many chances and have been disappointed every time. This location is right next to my building and should be very convenient- but instead it's the reason I've stopped going to Starbucks altogether. Unless you're ordering a pre-brewed coffee or tea, choose another coffee shop in the area."
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2018-10-26,5.0,"Shoutout to the employees here - so friendly and helpful! Eric listened to what I was looking for and made suggestions, much appreciated. Thank you!"
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2018-09-04,1.0,"I have been a gold member for 5 years and I am extremely disappointed today. I order ahead before I get off the Bus every morning so I can grab and go. I picked up my latte this morning just to realize that I got a cup of milk with sugar syrup! I didn't have time to go back and have it made again. Starbucks charges 6 dollar for a cup of coffee, and I paid that price to expect quality and service. I have to buy another cup of coffee from another store later on in the day."
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2017-07-09,1.0,"Worst Starbucks experience EVER. I asked the lady making our drinks which refresher had water and with had lemonade. She ignored me and her coworker told her I was talking to her and she said, ""I heard him."" And she never once looked at me or answered my question. Her name was Victoria, short African-American woman. I will never return here. Talk about ruining your mood for the day!"
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2017-06-08,1.0,Overcharged me and lied and saying the prices on the menu board are wrong. They absolutely refused to fix or acknowledge their error. Absolutely the worst experience at a Starbucks ever. Should've gone across the street to Grumpy's.
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2017-04-20,4.0,"got to try their newest drink--the unicorn.

sweet and sour at the same time.

very pretty drink."
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2015-09-08,1.0,I just ran up and down Lexington needing to pee so bad. My faithful Starbucks let me down. Apparently people don't pee up here or they are afraid of the guests who need to access safe restrooms in this area! Boo! #letmypeoplepee
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2014-10-20,5.0,My name is Matthew and I am the proud Store Manager for this Starbucks location. Feel welcome to stop by and say Hello :)
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2015-12-21,4.0,Regular Starbucks but or server was very patient with us since we got 10 gift cards some at different amounts for the holidays and he still got our order and name right!
1058,starbucks-new-york-384,2016-07-22,1.0,A coffee shop without a restroom.  Would give zero stars if I could. I had to repeat my order 3 times. Not a complicated order. A vanilla latte. I received a caramel Machiato with 6 pumps of vanilla. What?  And again food and drink and no restroom.
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2016-01-23,5.0,"The city is on blizzard alert. But we're New Yorkers, meaning no inclement weather is gonna keep us indoors. Pass this place daily on my way to work. Service is terrific and the food is prepared with care. 

Egg and cheese on a croissant pairs really well with light and sweet coffee."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2020-02-04,2.0,"Stopped in for a quick vanilla chai and donut . The place has upstairs seating and a bathroom which waS good but the bathroom wasn't clean  

The workers were very unprofessional and kept arguing with each other in front the customers lol 
The tables were decent and the service was slow  since it was very crowded  and only  2 ppl actually worKing ."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2018-12-24,1.0,Did I receive coffee or the water left over from cleaning the coffee machines?! There's another Dunkin' at East 45 and 3rd - skip this one and walk a couple blocks to the next one. Or go next door to Chelsea Bagel of Tudor City and support a local business.
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2017-08-01,4.0,"For a DD, this one wasn't too bad. Service was above average, as the employees were friendly and polite. Not only that, they got orders correct. The facility is clean and orderly, along with it having plenty of lighting. It's a little small and ""cozy"" so I could imagine it being a bit of a pain during peak times."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2018-10-27,1.0,"This is the closest Dunkin Donuts to my office and unfortunately it is also the worst I've been been to. The service is slow and the workers are rude,  dismissive and unapologetic. Whoever is at the register rushes thru your order and before you finish telling them what you wany they cash you out to pay and move on the next customer. If only the workers preparing drinks and meals were as quick as the workers taking your order. The workers prepping your meals are SLOW. By the time you get your hot sandwich,  your coffee is cold.  There were times I ordered thru the app and my coffee was ready but I got my meal 10 minutes after. What's the point of ordering thru the app if it won't be ready on time?? This place is ridiculous. Do not go here!"
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2018-11-15,2.0,"This location is not bad in the morning. Very quick and efficient. DO NOT go during the afternoon unless you want to point at the menu or Show a picture of what you want. I went with a coworker and they didn't even understand me saying, 3 times, that I wanted a mocha latte. It took longer than usual and I asked why and they just looked at me like I was speaking Chinese which it could have very well been because English was not their first language at all. If you are employed at a service industry that gets that much traffic in midtown NYC, learn the language please."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2018-09-29,2.0,"There was a guy making food inside the kitchen, he brought the food I ordered (and they actually changed bacon to sausage that I didn't know) with a really bad attitude and a face looked like I owned him $100000, ruined my morning."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2018-07-27,1.0,"Worst experience, usually dont go to this location but it was convenient considering my location at the time. Ordered a large cold brew and the women knocked the cup into the counter and a quarter amount of the coffee spilled out. Instead of refilling the cup with coffee, she added another scoop of ice instead. Do yourself a favor and go to another location."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2014-04-24,4.0,"There are a few DD's in the area but this one is fast, friendly, (pretty) clean, & makes their iced tea the way I like it to taste -not funky & mixed w/ coffee unlike others who don't clean their equipment. 

DD has better coffee than Starbucks' metallic-tasting blends & their 99¢ deal for a large (or any size) ice tea can't be beat-it's my go-to refreshing drink on a hot day!

Donuts are standard -filled or holed- & sugary sweet like the other DD's.  However, here's a worthwhile tip: If you keep your receipt & complete a 2-min online survey, DD gives you a code to get a FREE DONUT!  AND if you go on National Donut Day- a sweet holiday which was established by Salvation Army in 1938 to raise funds during the Great Depression in honor of the female volunteers who supported soldiers on the front lines during WWI by serving them meals & doughnuts- which takes place every year on the first Friday of June, they always give out free donuts! So, it doesn't matter whether you can get your hands on a Cronut when you can get one for FREE from DD!! ;9"
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2016-10-10,1.0,"This place is awful. Should you appreciate the franchise, sorry for you. This location ruins it. Good luck with your doctor after ingesting anything from here. 

You make me sick, literally. You should be ashamed of yourself."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2017-10-14,5.0,"It's a dunkin!  Your thoughts on the food depend on what you think of Dunkin'.  I like the munchkins, espresso (yes, espresso), and cold brew.  

The location is more spacious than others in NYC and the service is great.  Hence the 5 stars."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2018-05-06,1.0,Customer service is very bad. Attitudes all day. They can't make a decent sandwich to save there live. My wake up wraps looked like a crumble paper ball. My hash browns are always hard and burned. Came staff or better train them
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2015-12-05,1.0,"Your run of the mill small Dunkin Donuts. I agree with other reviews of this store---the boards are confusing as they have electronic boards, posters in front of the register, and along the wall. 

The thing that will ruin it for this place is the snarky and rude staff. The woman who took my order laughed at me when I asked if this location had the green Coolatta. She rudely said that she already told me and laughed looking back at the guy behind the counter. Really? Laugh in the face of a customer? That takes real audacity, but earns this place a one star!"
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2015-05-26,2.0,"I don't really expect much from a fast serve coffee place, but the accuracy of my order is probably the most important thing. This place only gets that right about 40% of the time. I think the flaw is in the fact that you order at the register, and then the register person basically yells your order to the people making the food and coffee (often yelling over other workers and customers trying to do the same thing). Things get lost in translation a lot, leading to longer wait times. 

Even when the order is right, the staff never even stirs the coffee and usually hands it to me with coffee dripping down the sides and on the top of the cup. A little extra courtesy wipe or even a smile would go a long way. 

I get that it's midtown NYC and it's busy and usually there's a line out the door in the morning, but the hurried nature of this place stresses me out.  

I'll do my best to avoid this place in the future."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2014-08-28,5.0,"The Dunkin' Donuts price parity here is $3.15.

***I hit up a Dunkin' Donuts at lease once day and order the same thing ""medium hot coffee, cream, three sugars and an old-fashion"" yet for some reason, it's not always that same price at different Dunkin' Donuts in the city.

This is probably the best Dunkin' Donuts in the city. If you come here enough times on a regular basis, the people here will have your order ready. This is what separates fast food service professionals from part-timers.

Every time I hit up a Dunkin' Donunts anywhere else in the city, I think to myself, they should train their staff here."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2015-07-31,1.0,"If zero stars was an option I would definitely give them zero stars. When you ask how you like your coffee and you respond with what you want they still give you what they want. This place does not listen to the consumer's needs. This will be the last and final time I visit this location
PS new employees should be hired!"
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2015-02-10,3.0,"Yes. This is your typical Donkin' Donuts. Average Menu. Average Coffee. Cheap Price.... However, I live in midtown east and there is literally no place to study with wifi into late hours of the night near home. 

This Dunkin' is 24/7. OPEN ALL NIGHT WITH FAST WIFI!!

The employee working the graveyard shift even offered me free coffee throughout the night! Also as I was leaving he prepared me a hot cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese for my walk home."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2013-07-20,3.0,"Super quick service.  The donuts and muffins are really fresh and moist (for some reason this seemed more true here than other locations).  For some reason a muffin and chocolate milk cost $5, but hey it's Manhattan.  Other than  the price, my only disappointment was that they only had fat free chocolate milk in the fridge.  That doesn't even make sense to me.  Had to put it back and grab something else, even though I already paid the high price for the chocolate milk.  Oh well."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2010-08-22,3.0,"This is the closest Dunkin' Donuts to my workplace, so I've visited on occasion to grab a nice cup of joe.  While not huge, this is a moderate sized Dunkin' Donuts with a clean setting and it has the current ""cafe"" style of decoration with the brown tones.  It looks really nice and welcoming.

The food I've purchased from here in the past ranges from coffee to donuts to bagels (I know, no shocks there).  I've never had anything here that wasn't good.  The donuts and bagels were always tasty and never stale.  The coffee is always well flavored and roasted nicely.  

I do have to say that the staff is a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde type deal.  Sometimes they're rather short with customers and seem to be a bit impatient while other times they seem super happy and chatty.  Then again, I come here to grab something quick and leave, not gab with the staff.

Not a bad stop on the avenue if you're looking for some coffee and something to munch on the cheap."

She hands over the wrong coffee then decides to yell at me because it isn't mine? Don't hand it to me then you insane person. It's not my fault you are miserable. She then continues to give me the stink eye until I have my correct order. 

Since there is a Dunk's on every corner, go somewhere else. This lady is not worth your order."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2014-01-09,1.0,"The coffee is decent. But I have a major complaint about the service. I dont know if it was the morning shift on that day or its the norm but that day I had to wait 8 minutes to get a simple order of vanilla chai. Also the waiter/barista was joking around with rest of staff and mentioned ""I know this is good cus I put my finger in it and tasted""....seriously wtf. I was so annoyed by that and I am maybe stupid or nice but I took the chai anyway and threw it out without making a scene. Anyways, I do like the other branches I have been to but this one is now a no go for me ever after that disgusting act."

Let's see what my choices in SF are:

Starbucks - Blaugh
Peets - Blaugh Blaugh
Others - Triple Blaugh

Yes...I think a good cup is well worth a $433 Jet Blue ticket."

If I were out, this might be useful.  Instead, I am sitting in a studio where the cable just went out, the DVD player is missing the remote and I can't turn on the lights to read because someone is sleeping.  Shoot me."

But if you are walking by one on the way to work, it works."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2007-01-17,5.0,"This Dunkin' has gotten me through many all nighters. Their coffee is great and their flavored coffees are really awesome. The iced caramel latte is much better than anything you'd find at starbucks. Of course, their donuts are incredible; I've yet to find anything that rivals the donuts of dunkin. My favorite is the apple crumb, it's so good!

Everything is always so clean! Their tables and floor are always really spotless.

I'm also partial to this location because the people working there are so sweet. After becoming a little more familiar with me, the night guy started giving me free donut holes (which my bf is insisting are called munchkins- to that I say, google image search ""donut hole"" then G.I.S ""munchkin and see whatcha get...)."
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2011-07-08,1.0,"This Dunkin' was the worst Dunkin' Donuts I have ever been in.  From not handling the lines, to overcharging, to getting the wrong order, I don't think that there was anything about my experience here this morning that would bring me back.  If this was the first Dunkin's I had been to, I doubt I would return to the franchise.  

Avoid!"
1059,dunkin-new-york-109,2009-05-09,2.0,"So I noticed last night that one of my reviews was taken down, but I could not for the life of me figure out which one.  But I eventually figured out it was my review for this particular location of Dunkin' Donuts that was missing.  Really Yelp? Dunkin' Donuts? The only out of the ordinary item in that review was that I quoted song lyrics by Isaac Hayes  that were a propos-- a song that I have seen performed on television and listened to on the radio.  Get a life people.   
----------------------------------------------------------


The location of this Dunkin' Donuts was convenient to my hotel at the time, the UN Millennium Plaza Hotel.  I tried ordering a chocolate glazed donut, but they did not have any.  The closest thing they had were chocolate glazed munchkins.  They proved to be an inferior substitute however since the ratio of surface area to interior volume of a small sphere was considerably different than that of a traditional torus (donut) which had a major impact on overall taste.  So being disappointed in the selection and taste, I did not rate this place highly."

After every time I've gone in (which is three times now) I've thought ""I'm not coming back here"" but I mean it this time!!! After having a dry blueberry muffin.  I've never had a dry ANYTHING at a Dunkin Donuts before. 

Never has a Dunkin Donuts made me want to slit my wrists.  Can the servers at least *try* to look like they're happy to be alive?  You're bumming me out, and I taste your sadness in my coffee.   I think I'll walk the extra blocks down 2nd to 40th Street."

I have to mention that 31 Flavors is attached to this DD, and I have been in here for a Sunday old favorite, the ""Old Fashioned"" donut as well as fulfilling that late night Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Cone craving. 
I love both of these DD/31 items, but this place makes me turn in my tracks. The counter service at the ice cream counter is constantly staffed with frowning Jack A**es who take no pleasure in scooping out a cone. I mean, it's enough to turn you off of ice cream cones. 
And the morning counter staff over a Dunkin' Donuts is incompetent. Riddle me this - how many DD staff members does it take to complete a .99 cash purchase?

The coffee I rarely drank? The glazed donut that really isn't very good at all? I don't know. I thought about such things often anyway.

Whatever nostalgia I may have for DD and the ol' ""time to make the donuts!"" guy, I can't really stand behind the product. I like Krispy Kreme's ultrasweet glazed version way better, and don't even get me started on the Doughnut Plant and the Donut Pub. Still, Munchkins.

Note to owner of this store: Perhaps you should tell your workers when they are sick to stay home. The young guy behind the counter could care less that he had a leaky nose, wiping his nose, then touching the cup he is about to use for my drink. This is not the first time I had to walk out of your store for disgusting things going on behind the counter. I had enough.

I started with the tomato soup which was kind of spicy. It had a smooth texture but had a kick to it that is unusual for tomato soup. Then I went with the avocado toast with hard boil egg. That was legit. There was some oxidized (a little brown) avocado on it but that is harmless. The food here tastes fresh and I would not hesitate to come back.  It is also reasonably priced.

1060,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-134,2019-07-28,1.0,I had a bad experience with service 3 months back. I must be a glutton for punishment because I still come here every Sunday and nothing has changed. The staff is lazy and the majority have a bad attitude if you ask them to do something more then placing a normal order they'll tell you you're being a problem. The managers are no better and just as rude. I once was paying with a E gift card which ironically was given to me for bad service. The cashier had a problem getting it to work. A manager came end gave me a attitude for what he deemed as me being difficult. Occasionally you get a person who is nice and willing to work. Today they wouldn't let me pay with the app because its being updated. They are giving 15% off for not being able to use it. I forgot to mention it when I paid and told the young Asian girl behind the counter I forgot about the 15%. She got upset let out a big exhale and got snide saying why didn't you tell me before you paid. She was visibly upset. A manager came to help and he gave me a attitude as well. I think this is the last straw for this location. Service with a attitude is their specialty. LPQ Corporate obviously doesnt care and just let it continue to happen.
1060,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-134,2019-06-04,2.0,"Good food, but I swear the server and manager treated us like an inconvenience for actually wanting to spend money and eat at their establishment

Updated review after seeing the response below from corporate (I assume)

We chose this restaurant for its quality looking menu, its apparent kid friendliness, and location (across from our AirBNB). We have 3 children, two exceptionally well behaved boys (9 and 11) and a 14 month old who can get noisy at times. 

Knowing this we chose the table in the very back of the restaurant, literally the one in front of the restroom door at this location. The restaurant appeared half full. 

And then we waited, and waited, and waited some more, until the server who was responsible for guests two tables from us and looked at us numerous times while servicing other empty tables with silverware finally approached us and collected our order. We pleaded with her to please bring milk for our daughter. This was the only thing she did expeditiously and we appreciated. 

Then we waited, and waited, and waited some more while she continued to service the other occupied table. If she was overwhelmed with other tasks it did not seem obvious and no other server came with our water and coffee order. 

Finally we got water. Still, no coffee aside from a promise that she was coming back with it. 

When she finally did come back with the coffee our food arrived in the hands of a manager (my guess given he wore a collared shirt and slacks) who was clearly irritated by something else and grew short with me as he asked who had what food. He served plates over my daughters head. 

The last straw was waiting for the server to return to check on us. If she had she would have known another item we ordered did not come to the table. She continued to make small talk with the other guests and service empty tables. We also needed condiments which the table did not have. I poached them from another unbussed table. 

I had enough. I approached her at the register where she was loitering and asked for the check and to ensure the item we ordered that we didnt get was not on the check. 

I have worked in the service industry for a long time and I would never stiff a person who relies on tips for a living. But I think a less understanding person would. I genuinely think they saw a family with kids and got annoyed, like some restaurant workers tend to do. This is an understandable reaction, but maybe tuck it away a little better for the next family so they dont have to experience your collective attitudes. Even better, if serving kids is not something you want to do, Smith and Wollensky is not far from this location. Perhaps try to land a gig there."

Let me start by saying that this is the only Le Pain Quotidien location I've been to that I would give a 4 star review rather than a 3 star one. Mostly because the service was pretty good. The waitresses were nice in their recommendations and very pleasant to deal with.

I ordered a glass of wine which was just mediocre.... but honestly, I am a wine person so my standards are high and I wasn't expecting too much. It was a pretty good value for the price ($10 per glass for what I had). I also ordered the hummus tartine, which was fantastic... I'm not normally a bread person but the bread was great, and the vegetables and harissa were delicious....

I would come back here again, for the hummus tartine alone. And maybe some of the other food if it is all as good as the tartine was.

The atmosphere was cozy and pleasant, as expected from Le Pain Quotidien."
1060,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-134,2016-11-23,2.0,"Story: Randomly stumbled upon this joint because we were too hungover to walk any further or longer to find food. I didn't know it was a chain, but it looked promising so we decided to dine in for brunch. 

Food: One word - overpriced. The avocado toast wasn't bad, but c'mon $11 for a small avocado on one slice of bread?! I get it, I get it... avocados are expensive nowadays, but bro, they are not $10/piece. Also, the scrambled eggs were flavorless and also overpriced. I certainly wouldn't mind paying for good food, but this was not it. 

Coffee: No. Just no. I was in dire need of caffeine, but I couldn't drink more than 2 sips of this. Legit, one of the worst iced mochas I've had in my life. Tasted powdery and watery. If I were the waitress, I would have asked why the coffee was untouched before bringing out the check to ensure my customer was happy, but nothing of the such happened. 

Service: employees are understaffed and overworked. We were waiting for a table and the waitress said to sit down at a dirty table and she'll clean it for us after. We awkwardly stood around and waited for her to clean it first. Then, we had to wait 10 mins before we got water (hungover Roma was not a happy camper) and we finished the pitcher right away, and another 10 mins later the waitress tried giving us leftover water jugs from other tables (half filled). This happened TWICE. Kind of off-putting if you ask me.  

Bottom line: I wouldn't come back. I understand that this could have been an off-day for the staff, but the prices of the food did not match the quality and tastiness of the food."

When I want to grab and go, and pick up the coconut macaroon. This chain has an outdoor area in the front.  All in all, it's good.

This used to be my to-go brunch because the food used to be good and waiters were super friendly.  On Wednesday 10:45am, we walked into this location and sat for more than 10+ min hoping that the waitress would bring us a menu or a cup of water. Well... by 11:00am I saw only one waitress was working and the store manager was handling everything in the front. It seems two people were running the entire restaurant!!??  Well ... we finally ordered the food. I ordered ""baker's breakfast"" which was supposed to come with ""marinated kale""... as time went by.... (another 20 min)..., I got my dish with ""salad"" instead of marinated kale.  The avocado toast was one tiny piece of toast (cut to half). The avocado toast looks so sad and not fresh.  When I was about to tell that ""it is supposed to be marinated kale"", the waitress was so overwhelmed because there were other people waiting for her.  I finally got her attention and asked why the dish was not as described on the menu/board. She went back to the kitchen and got the answer- ""we don't have marinated kale today""...  I returned my dish and ran to the front to grab a dragon bawl thinking that I cannot wait another longer for my dish otherwise I would miss my meeting.  I'm not sure what's going on with this restaurant. One waiter working on the floor seems ridiculous. 

To whoever is reading my review: If you are thinking to come here, be prepared to have enough time to wait. 

To the LPQ management team:  Please bring your service and quality back. It's sad to see a good restaurant goes down when there is so much potential."

1060,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-134,2018-12-16,1.0,This place has gone extremely downhill. Truly terrible service and rude waitresses. Our food took forever to arrive and it was cold when it finally came. Stay away!
1060,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-134,2015-08-23,2.0,"This restaurant is truly sub-par as far as Le Pains go. And I've been to many. This particular Le Pain runs out of oatmeal almost every day before traditional breakfast hours are even over. How can a restaurant repeatedly plan this poorly? If people come in at 10am and ask for oatmeal and you have run out and then the next weekend they come in at 9am and again you are out and then months later they try again and the same thing happens... this is a problem. Either don't serve oatmeal if you are incapable of making enough for your customers or--here's a wacky idea--prepare more oatmeal. (Not to mention that they are obviously not making the oatmeal fresh. They make one vat, serve it up and then call it a day when it runs out. Weak move, guys.) 

I'm giving two stars instead of one because the food is healthy and organic and it's a nice option to have. As a vegan I can recommend the white bean hummus in addition to the regular hummus, and the rotating chickpea, quinoa, and lentil vegan dishes. 

But not at this location.  

The service here can best be described as ""preoccupied."" And when your occupation generally revolves around tending to customers, that should probably be your focus. I could be wrong. 

The piece de resistance came today when I actually had to go back for a second time (after being denied oatmeal in the morning) to pick up a take-out order for my mom: The Organic Lentil & Avocado salad which contains: arugula, frisée, flax seed, raw vegetables, chickpeas and basil vinaigrette. When I placed the order I specified one ingredient to make sure they included it. Chickpeas. She told me they are in the salad as it is on the menu so they would obviously be in the salad. Obviously. 

I picked the order up and brought it my mom's apartment only to have her open the salad up and find no chickpeas. Amount of attitude when I called and reminded them that she wanted chickpeas in it? A lot. Amount of chickpeas in her salad? Zero. And to ass insult to injury they also completely left off the flax seeds and their idea of a Lentil & Avocado salad (note: avocado in the title) contained one tiny piece of avocado. The ""raw vegetables"" they referred to were a few slices of radish. The frisée was also missing so I basically paid $13.50 for a faint layer of arugula, some lentils and a hint of avocado.  

When I called to let them know they had left off the one ingredient I had asked they include, the woman said nothing. To the point I had to make sure we weren't disconnected. When she finally spoke again she said, ""I don't really know what we can do. If you want you can come back and talk to the manager."" 

I didn't. I bought a can of chickpeas and added them myself to her salad. So I suppose all's well that ends well but I can't go to the grocery store for all of you when they run out of oatmeal or don't include half of your salad so my best advice is to avoid this location at all costs."

The Greek yogurt was very good and they gave you a good amount of fresh berries - some of them were abnormally huge but hey they were delicious! The pain au chocolat was very good but not great - I just came from Paris so I guess these can't compare to those. Overall, everything was about $18 which is pretty okay given everything was very fresh and organic - I'd rather have that and pay a bit more than quick service food from Starbucks. If you are in the area and need a quick bite but don't have tons of time to spare - good spot to go to but wouldn't go out of your way to go here."

After laying eyes on this place and seeing their sign offering gelato, I entered their doors in hopes of having an affogato. It's quaint, small with few tables but very cute inside.

I asked for an affogato because I haven't had one since our family trip to Jamaica (Yes. Jamaica.) and I had been dying for one in recent weeks. The gentlemen behind the counter were very nice. I didn't have to wait long but had I had more time to spend, I probably would have asked for a spirit to be added to my little treat.

I sat and scarfed that bad boy down within five minutes. It was great. The gelato was a little frosted with some ice chips in it which was not too enjoyable but the flavour was nice. I definitely could have used some amaretto to make it complete but that will be for another time.

It looks like they offer a limited variety of food but they did have some nice looking sandwiches, salads and pastries on display. This is a great place to grab a coffee for a casual afternoon date or to have a light lunch/breakfast."

I had never been to this McDonald's before, but it looked newer inside (maybe recently renovated) and pretty clean. They also had a few giant ordering kiosks before you hit the counters, and since I like new tech, I of course had to try them.

I thought these would be like the ordering kiosks at Burger King where you just use them to save time waiting in line, but apparently I missed when McDonald's started rolling out table service last year. Not really something I associate with them, but when you order from the kiosk, you add a tag number and then someone delivers your food to you. It felt a little strange having cheap breakfast food hand-delivered to my table, but if it keeps people's jobs during the inevitable move to ordering by kiosk, I'm all for that.

Overall had a good experience at this McDonald's, and all the employees seemed friendly. I would go back to this location."

I have to say this is one of the best, cleanest, friendliest McDonald's I've come across so far in NYC. The employees move really fast & are always helpful. If you eat in they actually deliver your order to your table. They're also not cheap with the ranch or fries! That alone gives them 2 thumbs up in my book."

I did always like their fries and the filet of fish, but I have the former about once a year and the latter, every couple of years. I am also fond of their sundaes and when the junk food craving hits, will pop in occasionally. I had a rare craving for coffee today. Parents of hyperactive children, get the tranquilizer gun ready. Whoa, there was enough bold color here to make me want to do a Spider Man climb on the walls. Brightly painted in red, this joint has walls sporting huge pictures of fruit. It was clean, and the staff was very friendly. Thankfully, it was not swarmed at late afternoon with hordes of school children.

Pickiest Sis is our family P.R. person for McDonald's coffee and is the reason I even would go there for the brew.It's not as mellow as the Dunkin Donuts coffee I like nor as bitterly strong as the Starbuck's brew I thoroughly dislike. I asked for plenty of cream, which smoothed it out. There's no decaf, which is why I rarely drink their coffee. But at a buck a cup,  I wasn't complaining. This is a bright, clean McDonalds to eat in if you like the food."

Attempted to take advantage of McDonalds' new all-day breakfast menu by ordering the pinnacle of comfort food sandwiches - the Muffin Double Cheeseburger.  Just a double cheeseburger with muffins (available) substituted for the usual bun, the cashier, unable to find the button on the console, refused to fill the order.  Subsequently refused to just turn around and yell the order to the assembly team.  Ended up buying a Sausage McMuffin and the double cheeseburger and assembling the sandwich myself.  Good, especially since I was angry.

The workers are usually arguing with each other and cursing on the floor and are so concerned with who has the bigger pride that they neglect their customer service duties . I always regret coming here because either my food is cold, or i have to watch the workers feud. I even seen the manager just let them go at it and not say anything. I see now that they change some of the employees out but this McDonald's can do all the renovations they want for the store,  the customer service is H O R R I B L E"

1062,mcdonalds-new-york-110,2013-01-27,3.0,"My neighborhood McDonald's.

McDouble, Spicy McChicken, 20 piece chicken nuggets. This is the shit I occasionally eat at 3 AM when I've been chemically lobotomized by one too many PBRs.

I have no idea what their food is made of. I've heard many different theories. Corn? Rats? Aborted animal fetuses?

Either way, I'm not dead yet and I ate this about once a week in high school. Now I eat it about once a month, always washed down with face-size cups of poor judgement and transient regret.

People like to hate on Micky D's but honestly, no one is putting a gun to your head. Exercise your higher brain functions and show some self-control. 

It's a cold world out there. They will kill you if you let them."

Not to mention they can't even get the simplest of orders correct. I feel so sorry for this manager because she is the only one in that whole place that knows what she's doing."

Well seeing how you are, this place is cool because its one of the only McDonald's in Manhattan to have a parking lot and drive through (almost every time I'm here I see someone get towed so not park here unless you're eating here). Their ATM (like every other Mc D's is 99 cents), they have WIFI (though not free but very cheap), a second floor with lots of seating and its usually pretty empty so a pretty good place to have a meeting, work on something on your laptop, or just kill time. Wish they had outdoor seating to sit out on a nice day but oh well, you can't have it all.

And then theres the standard Mc Donald's menu, I'm not going to review that stuff, you know what its like, cheap and easy (insert joke here)."

1062,mcdonalds-new-york-110,2014-03-29,1.0,"It's McDonalds in the city. That's really all there is to say. I mean McDonalds in general is usually an experience that makes you question exactly how this chain became so successful in the first place. 

This specific McDonalds made me feel kinda sick. Oddly, it wasn't in my stomach or intestinal tract. Well, it was but I felt it Warming Up the Spleen before the ill feeling entered my gut. It wasn't the typical sickness one experiences from McDonalds...rather more of a discomfort then illness. 

It's amazing that a McDonalds location can mess up a staple such as French fries, but this location finds a way to do it. If it wasn't my dinner they were obliterating, I'd almost laugh at the ineptitude. It's putting frozen potatoes in a deep fryer and using a timer. This doesn't take a high degree of mastery of electronics, it's pressing buttons and waiting for beeps. This fine establishment takes this simple activity and turns it into an exercise in futility. 

That being said, I also had a chicken wrap. All ingredients were placed into the wrap and then it was closed with ingredients inside and provided for consumption. You may note that I described the preparation of a wrap, but when you're dealing with people who can't operate a deep fryer, it should be commended that they can properly execute the creation of a wrap. 

Maybe I'm being a little hard on the Golden Arches. I get that I may be expecting a bit much from fast food, but other competitors rarely drop the ball this bad. Just saying."

What was once a dumpy McDonalds is now one with bright wall decor, stylish chairs, and a clean interior.  If all McDoanlds could look this good, maybe it's worth checking out after all. (#1)

There is nothing to report on the food.  McDonalds is fast food that tastes, looks, and feels almost the same everywhere.  But one thing worth noting is the fact they don't have a dollar menu.  Many penny pinchers are sure to walk away disappointed.

My only experience here I made a mess of the place by spilling a giant drink in the middle of the floor.  The staff was so nice and not only replaced the drink, but apologized for giving me such a ""flimsy"" lid.  They were very nice and remained professional, which is more than I can say of other McDonalds locations in the city.

Food traffic here can get heavy during the daytime.  While half are probably here for the food, it's without question the rest are just folks walking in to use the free bathrooms.  Free public bathrooms in Kips Bay just spells trouble.

So I went to the front and asked and was told the same, I asked for a manager and she was next to the cashier I asked listening to the entire exchange with her back to me.  She scoffed and said that is our policy.  With only one cashier and a full line you would think they would make an exception for a child!  The attitude was disgusting and so was the location.  There were several homeless people sitting at the tables.  This they allow, but the not use of a restroom without a purchase.  I was more disgusted at the blasé attitude I was given.  I did not make a purchase and walked out.  Would never return.  I would love to know if the owners of this McDonald's know the conditions and attitudes of the employees.

Per usual the ordering process was painless, the food was in my hands in under a minute and my wants were satiated for the duration of consumption. 

Bun - light and sweet.  Patties delicately seasoned with a hint of smoke.  Fries crispy outside, flaky inside.  Hint: accenting them with ketchup augments their natural flavor. Coca Cola complements the whole experience providing a bubbly catalyst for digestion.

What can I say?  I'm lovin' it."
1063,tonys-coffee-cart-manhattan,2020-02-25,5.0,The best coffee cart in the Grand Central area. If you want the best breakfast sandwich and coffee in the midtown area? No need to look any further than Tony's Place breakfast cart. The donuts and pastries are always fresh also. Can't go wrong.
1063,tonys-coffee-cart-manhattan,2019-11-07,5.0,Awesome breakfast sandwich. Super nice & didn't have to wait long at all. I will definitely be going here more often for my breakfast fix!
1063,tonys-coffee-cart-manhattan,2017-05-22,4.0,while walking to work i notice a some crowd gathering at a coffee stand on the corner of 49th st and park surrounded by many  office buildings and decided to see the fuss. it's a large coffee cart that also makes egg sandwiches and bagels and it's only open from 6am to 11 am so i guess they must do a really good amount of business in 5 hours. the two dudes working the stand seem to know the regulars by name and i can not lie but the coffee smells good and i dont even drink java. so i decided to order 5 egg sandwiches and 2 large cups of coffee for under 20 bucks and try to make my way to work without dropping or spilling anything . i really don't like to eat from the majority of food stands but sometimes you gotta follow other yelpers who are at 5 stars reviews. i munched on the egg sandwich and it was tasty and my coworkers agreed (especially when it's for free). maybe when i take this route next week i will grab a few more egg sandwiches for my coworkers .
1063,tonys-coffee-cart-manhattan,2016-07-16,5.0,Great service. Very friendly.  Amazing prices. The egg sandwiches were cooked to order.  The coffee was hot and good and cheapest in town.
1063,tonys-coffee-cart-manhattan,2015-08-12,5.0,"Stayed at the Waldorf Astoria across the street, but was tired of spending $28 on coffee in the morning! Tony's is right across the street. They also have breakfast sandwiches made to order, as well as bagels and such. Wish I had found this fabulous food cart at the beginning of my stay. Breakfast and large coffees for two for $10. Can't beat that. Tony and his partner were super friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend."
1063,tonys-coffee-cart-manhattan,2009-12-24,5.0,"Can I Yelp a coffee cart?  I'm not sure, but I will anyway because this guy is really as good as they get in NYC!  He parks right outside where I work on the Southwest corner of 49th st and Park Ave until around 10:45am.  Some times I catch him and his co-worker Rodrigo right as they are packing up shop for the day, but they still serve me!

I usually go to them every morning for a coffee and have to wait in line for a couple of minutes.  It's definitely worth the wait!  Maybe it's how good the coffee tastes, how cheap it is, or how generous Tony and Rodrigo are (sometimes they waive the fee and give me coffees for free!), but it's a cart I think everyone should visit at least once while they live in NYC!"
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2020-06-09,5.0,"This is my favorite coffee stop in Hells Kitchen. Seating inside is very limited inside - only 3 or 4 bar stools - but they have a couple of tables outside when the weather is nice. I always get a coffee (hot or iced are both great) and bagel, but there are lots of other options like muffins, croissants, and açaí bowls. Baristas are very friendly as well."
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2019-12-21,1.0,"While the staff is very nice, I am very disappointed by this second visit.

I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, and there was a piece of hair in my bagel. I know it wasn't mine because it was light brown and my hair is black. I called The Coffee Pot, informed them of this, and they were able to make me a new bagel. However, I was just appalled.

Furthermore, I got the $8 deal of a small coffee, bagel w/ cream cheese, and the drink of choice. I also did not know this until I got home - but the expiration date on the juice is 12/09/19. I purchased my entire meal on 12/14/19. I just think that is careless and should be made aware. As customers, we should know that our food is clean and drinks are not expired..."
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2020-02-06,3.0,"Stumbled in here after looking for a cup of coffee by my physical therapist's office. This is located off of 9th Avenue, tucked right around the corner so it's easy to miss and doesn't gain the foot traffic that a coffee shop on 9th would. The inside is small and cozy and the guy working the counter was so nice - very cheery for 9am. They have a few seats located along the window but otherwise I'd recommend coming here for a grab & go situation. I was so excited to see they had oat milk so I got a large drip coffee to go with oat milk. They charge 50 cents more for the oat milk which annoys me but oh well. The coffee itself was hot but it was not great. I had about half the cup before I tossed it. Maybe it was a bad batch but I was disappointed. I will come back here though to see if they can redeem themselves in the area of ""Coffee Taste"" and a review update to follow!"
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2019-10-25,4.0,"The ladies were really nice but I did not get a chance to try their drinks as the drink my colleague and I were interested in trying based on yelp photos from the business owner and reviewers, the marshmallow latte with cocoa powder and mint, was no longer on the menu... or possibly just a seasonal thing?

I'd love to see it come back just so that we can try it, as V it definitely was a unique pull for us."
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2018-04-26,5.0,"The Coffee Pot is a quaint, small, and rustic coffee place that packs quite the charm in a small venue. 

My friends and I decided to stop here while waiting for a long brunch reservation in Hells Kitchen, and I am incredibly glad that we did. When you walk in, there is wooden walls that give the place it's rustic flair, however, it was decorated in a way that made it quirky, but also calming. There were succulents throughout the venue and it just felt very authentic. 

I ended up ordering an iced Matcha tea, which ended up being delicious! There are a variety of other options, but the latte I also tasted was really well made. 

Definitely a fun spot to visit and grab a quick coffee on the go!"

1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2019-09-24,4.0,"The Coffee Pot is a small cafe with 3 inside stools and a small outside seating area. There is a great breakfast special that offers a juice, a coffee, and a bagel for a reasonable price. Their set up is simple yet rustic which evokes a certain charm.

1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2018-10-23,1.0,"Since u guys thought it was ok to have my original REVIEW REMOVED... I'll REPOST IT...... AND ADD MORE

This was my go to spot until today. The manager was EXTREMELY DISRESPECTFUL AND DISGUSTING. She was condescending got way too comfortable and made implications that she knew nothing about and instead of rephrasing what she said after CLEARLY OFFENDING ME she just kept going. I will NEVER go back to this place nor will I go next door to Jasper's AGAIN!! (Same ownership)
And let me tell u its ur locals that keep ur businesses going 4-5 months out of the year during tourist off season. 

The managers name is Lolita or Laura I never cared to learn. Before her, the same team was working there. Since she started the team of baristas has continued to rotate. Attitude most certainly reflects leadership and with only 2 steady baristas..... including ur sorry manager, u won't last long."
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2019-03-16,1.0,"I wish I could rate this place on their coffee! Maybe it's the best cup in Hell's Kitchen? Unfortunately, I've gone there 3 times to check it out (a Tuesday at 5:05, a Saturday at 3:40, and a Thursday at 5:20) and every time I go the door are locked, despite it being within their advertised hours of operation! 

On the Tuesday shortly after 5, I even called because all the lights were on. I thought maybe the employee had to use the bathroom or something and would be right back. I called from outside the door and someone answered! I explained that I was outside and wanted to see if they would be reopening. The employee explained that they closed at 5. I told her that online it says they're open til 6 and I was right outside the door, but she said no we are closed. 

2 other patrons came, tried to open the door, and left scratching their heads today when I was there around 3:40. I called today too, but no answer. In the 2.5 minutes that I was standing outside they lost 3 customers. 

I don't get it! Why bother post hours?"

But the Internet WiFi is awful - it kept kicking me off and not being able to connect.  Paid $4 for a small fruit salad that had a molded strawberry, and they didn't have iced tea made."

Love it because... 
theres a place to seat. With wifi!! Cute place to seat down and work. I came here on Sunday morning after brunch. I like that is a quite place where I can focus on working! There's nice two person seating area for sunny days too 

Don't like... 
it's not for you if you're looking for a place to seat down and chat with your friends (4 or more)"
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2018-12-18,1.0,Normally head here for coffee early mornings but no more. Girl greeted me this morning sunglasses on and attitude. So it's 7am and I get it people are tired but I don't need sass from some 20 something who grunted at me the price of a coffee and bagel. Just be friendly. After all I'm paying your wages or was. Plenty of other places serving average coffee without your attitude. Bye
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2017-09-10,2.0,"New exciting place in my hood. Couldn't wait to try. It's always closed when i walk by. I had a week day off recently and low and behold they were open!
My story:
I walk in and there seem to be four individuals running the tiny place. The two behind the counter wouldn't make eye contact, avoided me, heads shrunk down into their shoulders and they began to shuffle back and forth behind the counter. It came across to me like they didn't have an understanding of who helps the customer and/or they have agorophobia. I also felt like I was inconveniencing them and/or that these individuals have never worked at a job before. They seemed to have no idea how to interact with a customer. I got a cup of regular coffee and it was good. I'm easy when it comes to coffee. 
Regardless of my experience if the place was open on weekends they would get a lot of business.

Pros: Small, quaint, outdoor seating. Coffee is good, not burnt tasting.
Cons: Confused employees. Not open on weekends."
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2018-11-22,5.0,This place is super cute and convenient down the street from my apartment. Went the other day and ordered a toasted bagel with cream cheese & an americano. It was one of the best bagels I've had in awhile and was surprised since it was a coffee shop. It's a small space but never crowded! Certainly recommend if you're annoyed with the over priced bigger chains.
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2019-02-18,5.0,"The cutest little hidden gem of a coffee bar, good cortado, they have all alternative milks! Love sitting at a window facing bar that's above street level."
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2019-08-11,5.0,Favorite coffee place. All the people that work there are pleasant and accommodating   Location is perfect for me since I live on the block. The muffins are delicious!
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2017-11-05,5.0,An adorable place for coffee and a nice pastry on a quiet street in Hells Kitchen. Absolutely charming with a friendly staff.  Great coffee and a nice outside terrace with a few tables to sit! Definitely a must for your Sunday morning caffeine fix!
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2018-03-15,5.0,So glad I found this coffee in the neighborhood. Especially I'm a dog mom. Outdoor space is very precious. Great coffee and tasty bagel (bacon & cheddar ) must try! Def become my everyday spot.
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2018-02-08,5.0,"Basically given 5 stars for having English chocolate !!! Turkish delight and Maltesers ... I was so excited, the poor ( very friendly ) server probably thought I was the local nutty Brit in the hood ;) Latte was not very strong but maybe the regular coffee would be better. I will definitely go back and will try and not eat all the chocolate ;)"
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2018-09-17,2.0,"A cortado is not a medium latte. It must have been at least 8oz of drink. Didn't taste great either, and was served Togo when ordered for there.

My wife enjoyed her mocha, though still not on the awesome list"
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2018-06-20,4.0,"Small shop, very quaint! Didn't try their coffee but got their kale smoothie and it was delicious. The texture was interesting as they didn't blend it completely and it had some chunks in it-- I felt like this made it more filling and forced me to drink slower which is a good thing. The smoothie had a tangy taste, if I had to guess, I'd say it was pineapple juice which balanced out the taste of the vegetables well. I've tried to make kale smoothies at home and they are always unappetizing so I was quite happy that the Coffee Pot gave me some ideas for ingredients to add to round out the taste of kale. Minus one star because of the high price but would definitely come here again to treat myself."

Now I'm starting to see some new faces but this lady named Laura has been here since I started coming here about 6 months and every time I come in, she welcomes me with a very nice smile. I love their coffee but the staff is also a huge reason why I keep coming back. For such a small coffee shop, they seem to get a lot of customers daily and if that's not a sign of how amazing this place is, I don't know what is!"
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2017-09-20,3.0,Big portions but there wasn't much coffee taste to the coffee. Prefer it over kahve because no taste is better than a weird taste.

1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2017-11-10,5.0,Stopped in for the first time this afternoon. There was a gentleman fixing one of the signs in front ot the store. I asked how long they've been open as I only noticed this spot a couple days ago while on a walk during lunch. He said they'd been opened for a couple of months. We walked in. I ordered a macchiato and a blueberry muffin. The gentleman who I now assume was an owner comped my muffin. It was a very nice gesture for a first time customer and made a great first impression. Now to the food and drink. Excellent! The coffee was flavorful and the muffin was delicious. I will be back and I hope others find this place as wecoming as I did.
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2018-10-23,5.0,"I've been coming to this spot everyday before work for about a year -- it's part of my daily commute: cup of coffee, nice conversation. It's tiny and cozy, filled with wood features and always a little touch for the holidays or season (right now, teeny pumpkins) ! Laura is a delight ! She really connects with her regulars and makes the Coffee Spot a real community gem. Highly recommend !"
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2017-11-17,5.0,"I love this charming place! Nice music playing every time I pass by, fresh coffee with plenty of flavors and delicious pastries. The Chai Latte is my favorite drink! Must try it!!!"
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2017-09-06,5.0,"Awesome spot that opened not too long ago.
It's a nice, cozy little café near 9th avenue. Location is perfect for the 9-5ers seeking a break from office and want to avoid the tourist crowds. Beverage and food options are great and their flowers make a nice change of scenery. Need more smaller coffee shops like this than the DDs and Starbucks that seem to me spreading out more and more in the city."
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2018-05-26,5.0,"I stumbled upon The Coffee Pot while I was in the Hell's Kitchen area. I got a hot latte, which was made perfectly. I enjoyed the good service and cozy atmosphere, and will definitely be returning."
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2017-10-28,4.0,"Advertises New York bagels and they come pretty close, not amazing but not artisinal. Reasonable prices and service was much better than a prior reviewer said. They are open on weekends."
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2017-10-07,3.0,"I was excited for this coffee shop as it looked to have a cozy feel and was located on my immediate block. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing but my iced coffee tasted more like water and for the price, it was definitely not worth it. Also the employees were not very warm or inviting. I'll probably give it another chance but based on first impressions, three stars is my recommendation."
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2017-09-09,4.0,"Great new coffee place in Hell's Kitchen! Friendly manager, good selection of pastries and bagels. Couple tables for outdoor seating."
1064,the-coffee-pot-new-york-2,2017-10-24,3.0,"When The Coffee Pot first opened I was excited for a new coffee shop in the neighborhood that served Califia almond milk and coffee that tasted better than Kahve around the corner. The barista was friendly and always remembered me and my order- 2 small iced decaf americanos with a splash of almond milk. Then the good/friendly barista started only working mornings (I come in after lunch) and the coffee just wasn't the same. Then, the less friendly afternoon baristas started charging us $2 for almond milk. I asked why- the employee explained that if we wanted free almond milk, we would have to order a drip coffee or an iced coffee. But I need decaf, so it is either a hot americano or an iced americano. In the caffeinated versions, she said the ""splash"" of almond milk was free. In the decaf versions, she said it is ""policy"" to charge $1 each. This makes zero sense. Just on principle I probably won't be a regular anymore."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2017-12-19,5.0,"This location is inside of NYU Langone Health hospital.  The service is generally quick and friendly.   My go to drink is the Black Coconut Bubble Tea.  OMG!! So good!  I have had others and they are quite tasty also.
There's a small pastry and sandwich section.  I've never had any so cant say if they are good or bad.
Seating area - comfy inside cushioned chairs & wood table and chairs. There's also an outside area where you can sit on a nice day."

1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2017-01-31,4.0,"I've been to this Argo Tea twice so far when my boyfriend goes to NYU to draw blood. I've always been a fan of their tea. The customer service here is pretty good. Everyone is friendly and helpful. 

I tried their Matcha Vanilla Latte and it delicious, but maybe a little too much cream. I've also tried their iced coffee on one occasion since I just really needed a coffee and the cafeteria at NYU doesn't make it. The coffee was on par! 

Overall, I think the little tea kiosk is great and convenient. It's a little expensive, but I think the tea here is very good and tastes natural and perfect for guests, patients, or doctors that prefer tea over coffee."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2018-03-03,2.0,"This Argo tea is a hit or miss depending on who is preparing your drink.  Iced matcha latte is usually a miss. The matcha doesn't get whisked properly, if at all.  I still found little balls of matcha powder at the bottom of my drink. My ""shot"" of matcha came out to be a full cup of hot water with matcha mixed in. Aside  from the hot vanilla matcha latte,  they don't know how to prepare matcha correctly. 

On another occasion, I ordered a tea with milk in it and the drink tasted sour as if the milk was spoiled. I brought it back to bring it to their attention and the sales clerk had the nerve to give me an attitude about it and tell me that it was supposed to taste that way. She did begrudgingly give me a replacement for the bad one. Apparently another yelp reviewer had the same encounter as I did. 

For the prices they charge,  I expect consistency and a higher standard in what they provide. Plus side is the convenient location of  it if you work in or are visiting the hospital."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2017-03-25,4.0,"A welcome intrusion of the outside world on the ground floor of NYU Langone Medical Center. It's a comfort zone for staff and patients' families who find themselves here. Their pastries and small sandwiches are good. The smell of butter from the heated ruggalach pervades the area. The teas are excellent. Now that there is beautiful new Tisch Cafeteria, Argo is no longer the only option on the main campus."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2018-11-07,2.0,"Working here, I come to Argo out of convenience. Starbucks is cheaper and at Argo you pay for them to hand you an empty cup to fill yourself. This would be fine if routinely the coffee urns weren't empty and/or any of the milk carafes had milk in them. Adding to the frustration are the four to five employees standing around the kiosk yaking, failing to ensure that the overpriced coffee that patrons have to get themselves is in fact available. I've brushed this off until today when I came up to inform them there was no coffee and frankly, they could have cared less. They all passed the buck on who should replace the urns, the guy who did meandered around chatting with everyone while people waited. No one offered to fill the cups. Overall thumbs down. The coffee is fine, but they're really just gauging hospital patients who have few other options."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2018-07-03,4.0,My absolute favorite in the morning M-F. I usually stick to a latte with half & half either hot or iced depending on my mood. I go for either the Leek & Parmesan bistro or the chicken pesto slider. Can't go wrong with either. Their other panini's are good too. In terms of teas I love their iced chai latte and their hibiscus tea sangria!
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2017-11-20,5.0,"Two things: 
1. Service is nice and gentle, the staff is always nice and helpful.
2. Drinks are just divine, as an avid herbal tea drinker I'm always in love with their fresh teas."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2016-06-23,4.0,"This was my first time trying Argo Tea, and I love their menu. The drinks offered here are very unique.

I got the Black Tea Coconut, which is a ""Milky Nilgiri black tea with chewy nata de coco, vegan and gluten free coconut 'pearls'."" I loved the nata de coco, though this is my first time having ones that weren't white/clear. Not sure if they dye it here to make it look like tapioca since this was under ""bubble tea"" or if it naturally comes in black too. I do wish the tea flavor were stronger, or that I got more tea compared to the milk. Regardless, I still enjoyed my drink.

My friend got the White Peach Tea Sparkle, and she didn't like it. :( I personally am not a fan of sparklers so I knew to steer clear of that :D

They also had 2 teas available for sampling. I have no idea what kind of teas they were. They do have a small calendar by the registers that tell you what teas they put out for sampling each day, but on the calendar, each day only had 1 tea under it. All I know is that there was an orange one and a yellow one, and the yellow one tasted great while the orange tasted like nothing even though there are orange slices inside."

located in the NYU medical center.. this would never be a good study spot, but a great option if you've got an appt in the building
---coconut flavor bubble tea with soy milk: comes with coconut Konjac jelly instead of boba.. SCORE since i don't like boba/bubbles! MMm the bubble tea is not too sweet & you can pick other flavors

i'll have to make regular visits to their more cafe friendly locations

1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2015-09-14,2.0,"I wanted it to be better than it was. Such a hipster little tea kiosk in the NYU lobby. I ordered the green tea ginger twist (hot)  asked what made it sweet, she said the ginger syrup, so I asked that she put in half as much. Still WAY too sweet. Either she didnt hear me or it's really really that sweet !  Unfortunately I had walked a considerable distance to let it cool before tasting it. I dumped it. I had also ordered a lemon blossom - big, sweet - good scone type treat, but couldn't finish it - too dry. On another visit, I did also try the tiny tomato quiche. THAT WAS DELICIOUS. go figure."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2013-07-24,4.0,"Wonderful teapuchinos.  Did I spell that right? Who cares, its not even a real word.  I have my go to green teapuchino skim, with vanilla.  
The one I ordered today I had to repeat my order at least 3x to the worker but he eventually got it right.  

This location is in the lobby of the medical center and its nice to be able to get my tea and either sit at the tables there and use the wifi or out in the outdoor patio space. No complaints here yet.  If given the choice id probably choose argo over starbucks lately, their arrangement of different tea drinks rather than focusing on coffee gravitates me towards it."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2012-04-04,4.0,"If you are at NYU Langone/Tish and you don't want (or can't) to go anywhere else for good coffe or tea fix then Argo Tea Cafe is your best bet.

Personally I'm not a fan of the center's cafeteria coffee (Dunkin Donuts) and avoid any pastries here,  thus I come here for a cup of joe and sometimes a chocolate croissant. Coffee is good, so is the tea but they are pricey. There aren't many chairs to sit and relax... this is more a station than a full bloom coffee shop. Mind you, they are inside a medical center, not in a mall/plaza.   

My experience with the service have been prompt and sometimes overly happy and energetic but hey... I'm cool with that. I'm not complaining.

3.5 stars."

Wow, what could possibly go wrong after an intro like that? 

Everything. I was there today after a doc appt. I was greeted winningly by the cashier, and I ordered an Chai Tea Latte.

Since there was about seven people behind the counter, I assumed it wouldn't take long. 

... After about 8 minutes, I asked Miss FriendlyGirl if my drink was coming up (after watching other drinks get called off).  She looked at me, smiled brightly and said, ""I'm sure it is. We're training today, so it's just taking a little longer."" 

I put this in quotes to display the lack of an apology for the wait, and to illustrate that she never turned around to even see what the staff was working on. She just assumed that my drink order was in.

...After another 10 minutes, I asked someone else behind the register about my Chai Tea. The order was never put in. It was a surprise to them. 

Mistakes happen, I realize, but apologies are lovely things. No one at Argo Tea apologized or even acknowledged that I'd been standing there for twenty minutes (!) for 16 oz of tea.  Which was about 99% milk and 1% flavor.

It pretty much fit the scene - all smiles, nothing's wrong, we're perfect, no apologies. I will never go to an Argo Tea again."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2014-06-16,4.0,"I stopped in here to get some bubble tea.  The cashier was really sweet helping me decide what to get.  I decided on the black currant tea with passion fruit and bubbles.  I honestly didn't have high expectations of the tea after it was made because it didn't look like the bubble teas I'm used to drinking.  However,  after one sip and then another I was a very happy customer.  The tea was rich and flavorful and not filled with mostly ice. The bubbles weren't tapioca but had a coconut flavor which I loved.  Since this location is right across the street from my job I will definitely return to check out some other flavored teas."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2013-04-20,1.0,"What was I expecting?
I've been walking past by an Argo tea daily for more than 2 years. Never went in. I'm not big on tea, I did not even know they were serving coffee...
What was I doing at the Nyu hospital all day is not the question, but once there and when its freezing out, one does not have a lot of options for a coffee. 
Ordered my first cafeinated drink of the day , with room for the milk, and ended up with a sock filtered tasteless dark potion (that they call american here).
Was pretty hungry too but the pastries looked pretty pale for an early morning...
This shop needs a shock treatment, better coffee, better treats supplier or just a little competition."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2015-12-24,3.0,"They use brewed tea and not powdered or artificial. Chai tea latte was very weak, mostly milk  and not much cinnamon taste. Raspberry green tea bubble drink was sooo sweet. The bubbles was not actually bubble, but it's nata jelly, very sweet nata jelly. The sweetness might have been in case of the ice melt. So if you drink right away, it's sugar syrup. If you wait till half of your ice melt, then you'll get a decent drink."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2014-11-28,1.0,"Staff here were all extremely rude, maybe due to working in a miserable, desolate location. Selection was weak at end of day, which is surprising for a chain, especially one in a healthcare setting."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2012-10-22,2.0,"The drinks here are good, but service is excruciatingly slow compared to other coffee places I've been to in the city.  Unless you're ordering a self-serve coffee, be prepared to wait 10+ minutes for the barista to even begin making your drink.  

There are usually 5-6 people on staff, but only one person at a time's actually in charge of making the drinks.  This is very inefficient since most customers only order beverages.  Two taking your order by the cash register, three leisurely making muffins and sandwiches for the *next* day, and one by the bar who's backed up with 4+ drink orders.

Just too many cooks in the kitchen."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2017-03-01,4.0,This was my first time at this Argo location. I came for an appointment and decided to try it out. I purchased a ' EarlGrey Cream' It didn't even taste like tea! which was pretty amazing! The staff here was extremely helpful and kind. I will def be coming back here !!
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2012-12-03,1.0,"Their only strength is that they have no concurrence. Horrible service, very unfriendly staff that works at snail speed. Within 5 visits (I was willing to give them extra chances) I have had: a cappuccino without coffee (yes), a mistake in my tea order, burned drip coffee, and a macaron crushed between the employee's tongs (he looked at it and put it in the bag).
From now on, I will bring my own tea bags to work!"
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2012-10-09,3.0,"This place is good for grabbing a cup of decent coffee. Their snacks are pretty decent too. I really liked their vanilla macaroons. I think it's even better than laduree's at half the price! Don't try to study here though, old chatty Jewish ladies will swarm your table, making focus an impossibility."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2014-05-06,2.0,"Captive audience in the hospital.  I'm a decaf drinker, so maybe it's not fair.  The two times that I have coffee, it's been below average.  It's better than random hospital cafeteria coffee, but that's about it.  Better than no coffee."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2011-02-05,3.0,"I usually get their fair trade coffee at any argo tea. I know it doesn't make much of a difference, but the coffee is out by the beverages and not served to you. But I do like their coffee (and it's fair-trade). The staff have been relatively nice. I can imagine it being such a rush.

I intern for the hospital so it's nice to have an indoor place to get good beverages. I had my first casual meet and greet/interview there and it's a perfect spot for a low-key conversation or a place to take a quick break. it seems the hospital is pleased with the argo.. a good break from the cafeteria."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2016-05-12,3.0,"It is nice to have a tea shop in the hospital. All tea are brewed and chilled in a jar. You can see at least six pots containing different tea with various colors on top of the machine. I am wondering if keeping the tea in a open jar inside a hospital is a good idea.You know, like floating pathogen... Anyhow, I like the staffs who are very friendly, and eventually convinced me to buy a bubble tea. You can choose soy mile, lactose free, skim milk, or REAL milk (Ah, I call it real milk). The bubble is different from other place. They are diced into very small pieces and super sweet. So be extra careful when you suck them out of the straw, chocking hazard. I can not taste anything from my, supposedly, green tea-rasbarry. It is just COLD and ICY and SWEET. My stamach started grumbling a few minutes after the tea went in and the discomfort last whole night. May be I will have something warm next time."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2011-11-09,3.0,"Definitely not the best Argo Tea Cafe location. It's kind of difficult to find the place because it's located inside NYU Medical Center. Also there aren't many places to sit, although there is an outdoor area right next to the cafe which seems like it would be a great place to spend some time relaxing on a nice day. 

The pastries didn't look very fresh, so I opted for the lentil chips which were pretty delicious!"
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2011-01-28,5.0,"This is what the Dr should order - stop here after your appt at the Hospital. What ever you order will certainly cheer you up, and it's a good sugar rush, especially if you just had tubes of blood taken some 20 yrs away. 
My fav drinks are: iced chari tea (they donate a % of the price to a different charity every month) , there is also a mint tea drink w. milk and chocolate that is to die for. 
I don't remember if this location has food, but their other locations do, and if you have their loyalty rewards card you get 10% off when you buy  a food and drink item. 
I'm also a fan of their chair poached chicken and cherry baguette!
While I don't want Argo to be the next starbucks, as to keep the lines down and the community feeling I'd love a location on the UWS!"
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2014-12-17,1.0,"Your staff are rude and unpleasant to deal with to get a coffee only a daily basis. This morning the cashier told me to wait so she could keep texting her friends at the cashier. She then told me to wait again, calling me ""sweetie"" when I asked if she could put my order through rather than keep texting. I'd rather walk the 3 extra blocks to get some good coffee with a side of manners than have the convenience of this place. The coffee isn't good enough to justify the bad service."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2015-01-18,1.0,"The stand was ok..Barely see girl behind everything. I ordered a large Ice coffee light and sweet. Girl handed me a ice coffee and said milk and sugar are on counter behind you. Milk was warm area was sticky and nasty and their sugar is not labeled, one I opened looked like brown sugar. It didn't matter because all the sugar went straight to the bottom and the half and half had a tang. Worst coffee I have ever had Dunkin Donuts only pays min wage and they can take a order and fill it. A monkey can sign you to do it yourself. Also I was tired after long day and I gave cashier 5 dollars and she gave me 65 cents and a receipt. I just put change in my pocket and next day I saw coffee was 2.45. I even checked my wallet. I received no dollars back. So whipped cream on day.....R$OBBED for lousy service and coffee."
1065,argo-tea-new-york-4,2011-02-08,1.0,"This is the place where I had the most disgusting cup of tea I have ever had the displeasure to drink. I ordered a black tea which came in a paper cup (bad sign already for a supposedly upscale place) with a nasty looking foamy froth on top that might have been appropriate for an espresso, but which tasted like pond scum. The tea itself was vile: rancid tasting and somehow insipid at the same time. I think they use some sort of tea essence instead of steeping a proper cup of tea with leaves (or leaves in a bag) for each cup.

If you want a reasonable cup of tea at a chain in NYC, go instead to Starbucks and drink Tazo or Harneys (which I think they offer at Seattle's Best Coffee) instead. It'll be cheaper and better.

Obviously, these next suggestions are not the same frame of reference, but to experience really excellent tea, go to Mariage Frères in Paris. Even the Benugo cafe at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London serves tea properly: leaves inside a cheesecloth-type bag in teapots, with a separate china cup. (For those two places, see my reviews ad loc.)"

I was on my way to a friend's and my wife asked me to stop and pick up some cookies to bring over. Zaro's fit the bill.  You'll find the classics here - cookies, brownies, cake by the slice, scones, muffins, etc. All in all, the quality is good and prices are average.

There are several Zaro's locations within GCT.  I have lost track of how many they have now, but some carry different products. The one in the food court downstairs has the largest selection, with sandwiches too."

Just bought a bagel at  8:45 pm 
threw away the most stale and unpleasant  piece of cardboard disguised as a bagel that I have had to endure

Also found the counter staff to be unorganized and surly

I always get a salt bagel with cream cheese. They do put an excessive amount of cream cheese on the bagel but I just take some off. My friend got a cinnamon raisin bagel with raspberry jam. She loved it. There are multiple locations throughout grand central. I find each one slightly disorganized in the ordering and paying process, but it always works out. Awesome bagels!!"
1066,zaros-family-bakery-grand-central-terminal-track-34-new-york,2018-10-08,3.0,I know I reviewed this Zaro's location. It's across from the Transit Museum. When I was working I came through Grand Central daily. I was going to get my morning coffee here every day. The employees were so rude I decided not to. Since then I have eaten here. I found somewhat of an improvement. At least there's seating nearby. Downstairs trouble is you must wait until 7am when the concourse opens. I'll stick to this location upstairs. The bagel was so good I didn't mind sitting on the floor!! Reasonable prices too! Decent coffee!
1066,zaros-family-bakery-grand-central-terminal-track-34-new-york,2019-08-13,5.0,"I hope I'm writing about the correct location - while both Grand Central locations I've been to offer fast service, great bagels and fresh iced coffee - this review is about a specific happening this past weekend.

I was uncaffeinated and about to head to a family get-together. In preparation, I swung by Zaro's and ordered the largest iced coffee they could legally sell me. Still half-asleep, I set my phone down on their coffee counter and forgot to pick it back up. Blissfully unaware, I boarded my train to CT. Once I realized my mistake, I was already miles away and on an express train to Phoneless-Ville. 

But this story has a happy ending - Zaro's came to the rescue! Their employees were the ones to find my phone (probably when cleaning their coffee station - seriously, spills never last long around these parts) and held onto it THROUGH a shift change. I sheepishly returned, 6 hours later and I was reunited with my bab-I mean, my phone. They even had me confirm it truly was mine by having me dial my own number using another phone. Top notch security. You really can't find that most places. So props to these guys for having integrity and excellent customer service. 

I'll be a customer for life. Thank you!"
1066,zaros-family-bakery-grand-central-terminal-track-34-new-york,2019-02-25,5.0,This place is good. I got three cookies and a cheesecake. Everything was delicious. Service was okay. It's pretty busy but most people are in and out.
1066,zaros-family-bakery-grand-central-terminal-track-34-new-york,2018-12-01,2.0,"Zaro's is your ex boyfriend from high school. You KNOW he's no good. You know it! You left him for a reason. And yet, when you go home for the holidays, you're so bored and desperate that you go back to him, ultimately feeling unfulfilled and angry afterwards. 
Believe me when i say i searched for any alternative to Zaro's today, but my train was coming and i was: Desperate. I ordered a bagel and an americano. Of course there was a drama about the coffee, with the person at the counter trying to upcharge me. Sounds like that time your high school ex boyfriend got mad at you for studying with your lab partner after school even though you TOLD him you have a test tomorrow. Just mean!
Then, as i found out on the train, they gave me a lid that didn't quite fit so now i feel like an idiot mopping up the multiple coffee puddles on my jeans, on the floor, on my arm, everywhere. Kind of like when your ex boyfriend asked you to watch his dog for the weekend but didn't tell you it wasn't house trained. Why would he do that to you?
That being said, the bagel was good. They got it to me really fast and it was hot. Coffee also tastes good. But PLEASE remember that you deserve better than this! You don't have to go back to your ex! He's mean to you, lazy, and there are way better options out there that will give you what you REALLY need."
1066,zaros-family-bakery-grand-central-terminal-track-34-new-york,2019-08-04,2.0,"I have been coming here for my entire life. Today, I was charged extra for one of their iced coffees and the charge was added on once she old me one price, then she added 50 cents which were just taken from my returned change. When I said something the person there was pretty nasty. I also was getting mad, but only because I was just blatantly overcharged once I was told one price. This is not something to do, especially when you have many legacy customers. Now I don't feel the same about Zaro's."
1066,zaros-family-bakery-grand-central-terminal-track-34-new-york,2019-04-16,3.0,"I come here often before my early morning train ride to work. Their croissants and cretzels (croissant + pretzel) are good. The cleanliness is okay... sometimes the condiments station is not clean or stocked. Their iced coffee is bland. The customer service is terrible. Those workers need training on providing good customer service because they are mostly rude. Good croissants, bad customer service."

I ordered strawberry cheesecake wedge, four cannolis, A SINGLE CUPCAKE!, and two sodas. It's starting to become a joke, TRULY ANNOYING!"

Not worth it.

Thank all the staff! You guys are amazing!"
1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2019-11-26,4.0,"I have a soft spot in my heart for this location of Pick-A-Bagel. Shortly after this new location opened  I met my Yelp Friends Ellen and Cesar from Las Vegas for the first time. (July 25, 2016). They frequently visit NYC for work. We have since become like family. My Yelp Children. They selected this location since it was near where they were staying. 

I've been inside since but have yet to get a bagel. They don't offer the 15% Yelp Discount when you check in. That's disappointing. I usually get coffee as the cupcake shop is across the street! I will make it a point to get a bagel here soon. They make the same bagels at all locations. 

If you have been to a Pick-A-Bagel you know they use the same set up. It's straight and narrow with seating on one side and food line/cashier on the opposite side. After the trouble I had during peak commute to work hour, I'm going at brunch time 10:00-11am. It's the time most NYC businesses convert from the breakfast menu to lunch. They're busy setting up the salads with fixings. Customers thin out since they're all at work by then. 

This location is a little brighter inside with White Brick. The tables are clean and employees have been friendly to me. When they first opened I offered to put them in Yelp but they declined my offer. They were working out the details since it was so new. That was my visit July 25, 2016. 

I surely recommend the bagels, cream cheese, and huge muffins. I hate to admit it but it's worth the extra $1.00 I would save eating in my neighborhood!"
1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2019-08-31,3.0,"Okay, granted. There are plenty of reviews here noting the prices have been gradually increasing and that the value may not be high. However, I disagree. For the surrounding establishments on lexington avenue, this place certainly offers you the standard bagel options with flavored spreads - and for cheap! 

It's never crazy packed and there's plenty of staff available to make your bagel just the way you like it. You'll see by the pictures but they have plenty of delicious cream cheese spreads including walnut raising, new scallion lox, avocado, low-fat veggie and sun dried tomato cream cheeses. Often times on the way to work, I'll stop by this place and know that I can always get in-and-out within 5 minutes (typical NY style). 

Yes, there are better bagel spots in the surrounding area (Ess-a-bagel) but GOOD LUCK waiting to get your food. You'll be there for at least 30 minutes. Check out this spot, pick-a-bagel, and see if you can spend an extra $0.25 for a basic bagel. Trust me, it'll be worth it."
1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2019-08-30,3.0,"Conveniently located by the 59th street train station and my job. They have great freshly baked bagels but every time I come in here the prices keep going up. I mean $3.25 for a toasted bagel with butter is a bit much. 
I will say though they have an AMAZING Supreme Ruben sandwich which is worth every penny."
1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2018-10-11,4.0,"Beware.. this is my first bagel in NY

What did I get
I picked the whole grain bagel with avocado spread. They don't do this in Florida... so I am excited. They toast the bagel steaming hot and spread the avocado for you and also cut it in half! Like it should be. I can't notice the NY bagel difference but I do like the amount of spread there is available for a bagel! Oh and I also got a cup of coffee to go with it.

Environment
This was in Manhattan. a small store with limited seating. You join a busy line and should know what you want! I was able to step back and look at the menu then go and make my order

Niceness of the staff
It was a pretty simple process pick-a-bagel... so should be fast moving. I was able to try the avocado spread though. I was under pressure so I just went with it, but it wan't bad.

Dollar
It was relatively inexpensive. I honestly forgot how much it was... I want to say about $5 or less.... don't quote me...

Yes?
Yea I would go here again, but I definitely want to try other bagel places so I can have a better feel of the NY bagel-ness

1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2018-09-23,2.0,"My least favorite bagel place in NYC, they had a nice selection of cream cheeses but their prices are higher than the better places in the city.

Ordered the smoked salmon sandwich salted bagel and it didn't come with anything but the cream cheese and salmon. Weird that it was so expensive and overly salty compared to other locations in NYC. The cinnamon bagel with walnut cream cheese was decent, the everything bagel with sun-dried cream cheese didn't taste like 'everything bagels' at other places that were loaded with flavor.

I guess when you see a place with no line of people waiting to order is a bad sign around brunch time.

Will not be back."

Finally a manager offered to make it correctly and I noticed he did not toast it like I asked and he lashed out on me, literally yelling at me. I told him not to speak to me in such a way since I only asked him to toast my sandwich. I was taken so off guard, I wish I could rate this place zero stars. All this drama for a sandwich and it completely sucked for $13! Never coming here again the worst bagel spot, go support your local delis! Cheaper and better costumer service!"
1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2019-08-19,3.0,"I get the same thing at every bagel place to ensure fair assessment.

The everything bagel, not toasted, with veggie cream cheese was fine. Pleased with the seed-to-bread ratio (can always use more in my opinion but not unsatisfactory), disappointed with the texture (crust should be harder without a toasting), acceptable cream cheese with a celery surprise.

The ""fresh OJ"" is at minimum cut with commercial orange juice. It's not terrible/a total fraud, BUT: don't pay the $4.95 for it.

I am happy that this place was at least open past 3. Now if I could only get the best places to stay open when I had time to get to them."

Pick-A-Bagel is inconsistent in terms of what they put in the bagel, how much they put in the bagel, and surprisingly the price. I have gone to this bagel shop multiple times over the past few weeks and ordered the exact same thing, but rarely get the exact same thing or pay the same amount. Also, on my most recent trip I asked for avocado cream cheese but ended up with a green pepper and onion cream cheese. Overall disappointing shop"

1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2019-01-07,4.0,"This is my local bagel shop but it took a really long time for them to get things together in the service department. 

I was there twice in a week---I love their Santa Fe salad (but sub chicken for turkey and spinach for romaine)--and both times my order was right. 

It's expensive (and they charge 2 bucks more for the lox spread so 6.50 for poppy with lox spread which is a lot). But the quality is excellent. Omelets are fluffier and better than your average bodega flat-as-a-pancake omelet. 

But I love the bagels, though I only eat one a month. 

Also, it's my favorite coffee. I usually brew my own at home but I prefer this to any chain (Birch, SBX, and CBTL)."
1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2018-11-26,4.0,"Typical NYC bagel spot with really good looking pastries and solid bagels. I ordered a sesame seed bagel with regular cream cheese, lox, and tomato (they didn't have lettuce because of a CDC recall). The bagel had a super hard shell, but the inside was very thin and a little too hard. It also had a ton of lox, resulting in the lox going all over the place when bitten. They have great coffee as well. It was pretty expensive even for NYC bagels, coming out to 17$ for the bagel and coffee."

I ordered an everything bagel with vegetable cream cheese. I also ordered an oatmeal with brown sugar and bananas. I gave the cashier lady $10 thinking she said $8.65. She said $.65. I confirmed it was $10.65 and I gave her another dollar. She gave me my change in the most rude and nastiest way. NASTY! RUDE!"

This establishment has a variety of food and beverages to choose from. I kept it simple and had a toasted whole wheat bagel with butter.

For my beverage, I requested a SMALL iced Hazelnut coffee  (no French Vanilla unfortunately as an option). Although there were only large cups available,  I was charged for a small."
1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2019-04-16,4.0,"Modern and updated bagel shop in the Upper East Side. We went in the early morning during the rush and the line moved quickly but efficiently. We both got toasted bagels with egg salad and received them only a few minutes after ordering. Prices were reasonable and seating was great, if you can get one (which we did). The egg salad was a little bland, but everything else was good."
1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2019-12-30,2.0,The bagel was good. They have such a huge selection of spreads however they want you to go in knowing exactly what you want. Service was rushed and the employees are pushy. Good luck getting a place to sit and eat.
1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2019-05-10,1.0,Two days this week worst shop ever. First day walk in... we have NO BAGELS WITH ATTITUDES.  Is this not a bagel shop and an hour after open. We are waiting for them to be delivered. Second day same week.. four choices all my least favorite... we have these four... that's it. Wtffffff??? Worst ever
1067,pick-a-bagel-new-york-17,2018-08-17,3.0,"Decent bagel although I'm still trying to figure out why an everything bagel has oats on it.

Usually I do lox spread, however they want an arm and a leg for that ($6) so I opted for scallion cream cheese which was good. It seems I caught them on a good day because they slathered on the cream cheese in a pretty decent amount."

1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2019-05-04,5.0,"Gregory's Coffee is conveniently located close to my hotel. I decided to grab coffee and breakfast before heading into the office.

There was already a line when I got there, but it moved fairly quickly. I ordered a flat white and a non-spicy avocado toast (no chili oil and flakes). Both items were enjoyable! The flat white had a well-balance flavored espresso that I can still taste even with the steamed milk. Avocado toast had a ton of guacamole smeared onto the thick multigrain toast. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have like, but totally understand that it's because I omitted the spicy.

Overall, I had a good experience here and the staff was friendly. I would definitely come back when I'm in NY next time."
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2019-08-21,5.0,"Love Gregory's! Discovered the chain on our last visit to NYC and had to get me a to-go latte (pumpkin spice!) as we get back on the road to head home from our visit.

This Gregory's is a tiny shop but it's clean, bright and cheery, the service ROCKED and of COURSE the latte was spot on. Our barista created a simple but beautiful latte-art for me that made for a cool pic! :) Unexpected surprise that made my day, made my smile a little wider and is making my trip home a little tastier! See you next time NYC!"

1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2019-07-26,4.0,"Decided to try this place because it's close to work and my co-worker fell in love with this place. He said it's the best latte he's ever had. 

I ordered a large dirty chai latte with almond milk and it came out to $10, maybe more. Ridiculously expensive.  But, it tasted great. It's my go-to order a few times I'm falling asleep at work since I was launching my blog and getting close to 4 hours asleep at night. I stick to regular coffee now.

I also once got a small or medium dirty chai latte for my co-worker who was having a terrible day and he loved it!

I get their chocolate bites sometimes and they are so yummy!"
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2019-09-30,5.0,Tried Gregory's again when they had a promotion going on with my company about a year ago and since then I've been hooked! I have at least 1-2 drinks every day with no regrets! I usually order a hot small mocha and if I'm in the mood to eat- a spicy avo is the way to go! Or the banana nut cake. The experience cannot be described nor matched with anyone else's!

1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2017-07-25,5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked to work this morning to see a Gregory's Coffee pop up on my commute! With the closest Gregory's Coffee previously being a 10-minute walk away, I had to stop in to grab a good cup of Joe this morning (and to add the business since I was surprised that it was not yet listed).

For those who have not been to any other Gregory's Coffee, the chain serves quality, robust coffee for moderate prices (for Manhattan at least). A standard cup of coffee will cost you around $2.50 for a small, while the more sophisticated options (lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, cold brews, etc.) will cost you between $3 and $7, depending on what you order and what size you select.

In addition, Gregory's coffee offers a terrific assortment of bakery items: muffins, cookies, scones, and other fresh and tasty options.

This location (being brand new of course) is incredibly clean, and the staff was already well-trained and serving us efficiently. I expect that this place will be very crowded as word gets out about the location. The shop is rather small, so I'd expect a line out the door at peak times. Otherwise, if you're in the area and love a good cup of Gregory's Coffee, be sure to stop by!"
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2019-10-13,1.0,"This was a terrible experience.  Came in 3:50pm today. Ordered a black ice coffee and a pastry.  Told the server that I was going to eat it there.  After 5 minutes of sitting down I was told that they had closed and that I could take my food and drink with me.  Which I left on the table.  It was a big turn off. I will tell the thousand people I know about the unprofessional and lack of empathy on their part.  But I always think of a saying that a very wise man once told me. ""If the fish stinks it comes from the head"". Shame on management for the poor training."
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2019-09-26,5.0,Love getting my morning latte in this location! Service is always friendly and quick!
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2018-05-25,3.0,"After trying Gregory's on 46th for a coffee date and really loving their cold brew, I decided to pop in and try this one--far more conveniently located than the other.  Unfortunately, there are some flaws that make it less than enjoyable for me.  First, there's SUPER limited seating (I think there were three tiny tables crowded into the corner, but there may have only been two), which means you have to hover if you want to stay in.  

More importantly, the coffee is only okay.  The chocolately tang I loved the first time seems to be missing, and the coffee is a pretty inconsistent.  I also didn't love the pastry I had here (I got a donut, it was okay but nothing special, and I wished I'd just gone three doors down to Dunkin).  

I like it, but I don't love it.  Try the Gregory's on 46th instead, and get the cold brew, or go to one of the 18 other coffee shops on the block."

However the coffee itself, I got honey badger cold brew (honey, almond milk, cold brew) was sour but smooth. The rice Chex has buttery and good. Disappointed the coffee wasn't that good."
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2018-04-01,5.0,"I know, Gregorys is a chain. But, this location is also my new favorite coffee shop on the block. Yes, it's super convenient that I can run down from the office and be back up to work all in less than 10 minutes. But I really do enjoy the coffee and food options here. The classic cafe blends are super solid, and they have fun items like turmeric and beet lattes (definitely worth a try!). There are also some great snacks, like a high protein chocolate concoction that's only 100 calories, and nice overnight oats. And, the new app is pretty good."
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2019-05-14,5.0,"I've been coming to this location of Gregory's for over a year now. At first it was due to convenience based on proximity to my office, but what keeps me coming back are the employees. Any coffee shop can brew good coffee or make good espresso drinks, and they certainly do both, but every member of this staff is beyond kind, and they take the time to learn your name and your regular drink. It's the little things that make this coffee experience that much more enjoyable."
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2017-07-28,5.0,"I LOVE Gregory's Coffee and it's even better that there's one right in my office building!

Each morning when I walk in, I pop in for a cup of their drip coffee and what do ya know? They even have snacks in the front counter for you to take! Not only is it less crowded than Starbucks  but it's also better quality and nicer selections.

Stop it on your way to, from, and during work! You won't regret it :)"

1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2019-04-24,5.0,Amazing coffee and I tried their vegan coconut scone. It is so good and even gluten free? I was so surprised. I went at 4pm and the scone was still soft and just fantastic. Blown away!
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2018-06-05,2.0,"This is unfortunately my least favorite Gregory's Coffee franchise in the city. And my coworkers agree.

1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2019-09-24,5.0,This place is my go-to every morning for my cup o'joe! Love the staff - always friendly and remember my signature drink
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2018-03-28,4.0,"There is very limited eating available at this location, and it's small so the line during the 8-9am coffee rush wraps around the cafe. However, they are very organized at this location and you get your drink pretty fast and they call out your name so you know where you are in the queue. They do this at some other locations, but they're especially good about it here.

The pastries also sell out pretty fast along with the avocado toasts because they're new and popular right now. I went around noon and they were almost all gone! I love their dirty chai, but it's very expensive. I've also tried the chocolate chip cookie and brownie from here. The cookie is chewy and has the perfect amount of chocolate chunks, while the brownie is dense and chewy. 

If you're going to any Gregory's Coffee, you should download the app because they will send you emails for deals like bonus points, etc. For every $50 you spend, you get $5 in credit. Drinks at Gregory's are a little more expensive than Starbucks, but you hit that $5 credit fast and it all breaks even in the end."
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2019-03-05,5.0,"This is probably my favorite Coffeeshop in all of Manhattan - especially because the service there is so amazing. Even though the store is right in Midtown, Kush and Crystal make it seem like the most comfy and friendly store. They provide an amazing service, will prepare amazing drinks, always welcome you in with a smile and have the store in great conditions. They are so great, that after one time of stopping by, they will remember you and your order!
Highly recommend Gregorys for any coffee, pastry, sandwich or meal you want to have (or if you just want to go in and hang out with great people)"
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2018-11-27,5.0,"Gregory's is my favorite Manhattan coffee. It's always brewed well and never burnt, with a consistent flavor. They also offer many healthy and unique beverage and food options. I happen to love this location as the staff is very friendly and accommodating. For both locals and visitors, I would recommend Gregory's!"
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2018-10-02,2.0,"I have to agree with other reviewers. This is my least favorite location. My cappuccino is made different every time. I used to rely on Gregory for consistency but anymore. The new baristas are untrained. I don't even care that they stoped putting design on their latte drinks, but the taste is off too. Today my cappuccino was so wrong. It had terrible foam and taste was off. I never saw them add a shot of espresso after they finished the cappuccino with foam and all."
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2018-08-17,4.0,"Great coffee and open-faced lox toast, iffy service, and very limited seating at this location. 
I visited around 7AM on a Thursday, and was one of only 2 customers there at the time. It was my first time at a Gregory's Coffee, so I needed a bit of time to decide what to order. However, the barista seemed annoyed about this, and even more annoyed when I asked if they had soy or almond milk. Her reply was basically ""Obviously, we have both."" I understand it's early in the morning for everyone, and maybe that question was dumb, but customers would rather not start their day with sassy/grumpy servers. 
Although there were almost no other customers, my lox toast took about 15 minutes to make. I am pretty sure it does not require significant preparation besides toasting bread, so not sure why that took so long. 
While I loved the interior decoration, with hanging lights and warm colored wood paneling, there is very limited seating here, so it is definitely a grab-and-go place. Do not try to bring a laptop and work here. 
Verdict: would be happy to stop here again for coffee, but would not expect great service."
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2017-08-08,4.0,"I went in on the first day it opened. They were very friendly and patient when I wasn't quite sure of my order. They offered some suggestions based on what I told them I liked, so I went with the Dirty Chai. It was delish- my new go-to! I also tried the coco cookie. That was, eh, not so delish. I couldn't even finish it. They had a decent selection of other pasties but limited on other heartier items (lunch & breakfast). 

To get people talking, they handed out coupons for a free small drink and also offered a free beverage to those that worked in my building since it was connected. I think that was a nice offering- good marketing too.

When I pass by I don't see many people in, but I hope it picks up as the staff seems super nice and the drinks are ! Hope to be back soon."
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2019-01-26,5.0,"A general review of four different Gregorys that I've visited in NYC in my three visits there. Their cold brew is excellent. I love their chia and power breakfast pudding things. Oatly oat milk!!!! It's the only coffee shop where I can get many delicious non-dairy options, and I hate that they're only in NYC. Love this chain."
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2018-11-26,5.0,Great coffee and Crystal is super cute and good at her job. Free water is a plus. The shop is small.
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2018-01-02,2.0,"There's something wrong with this location. I used to go to Gregorys every single day when I worked downtown on Broad Street, and had no complaints. I tried a turmeric latte today at the Lexington location, and it tasted terrible (I normally love turmeric lattes). Staff was nice and gave me a chai latte to replace it, but it was overly sweet, not frothy and thin. Is the almond milk bad? Are the ratios of milk to tea off? You tell me, Greg."
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2017-08-23,5.0,Best coffee I've had in a long time !! Better then Starbucks! (Sorry Starbucks) you lost a customer. I was skeptical about walking into this coffee shop and so glad I did. Ordered a latte and it was perfect.
1068,gregorys-coffee-new-york-31,2018-08-03,2.0,"Not impressed with this location..I used to go to the one on 46th Street..but my office (unfortunately) moved closer to this location..it's too small and cramped and the seating in the front is ridiculous, who would feel comfortable sitting there?  Also where they have the area to put the milk/sugar in is right on top of the seating, very weird set up.  Went in there this morning and the sugar was one big clump like they hadn't changed it in months, couldn't even pour it out of the canister.  LOL, all the coffee places in this area are too small.  At least they keep the line moving but I really miss the one on 46th."
1069,debutea-mini-new-york-3,2020-02-14,5.0,"I love bubble tea. If I could go every day I would, but let's be honest, it's pricey. However, when I do go I enjoy every bubble tea this place has prepared for me. I was a bit reluctant to try the cheese tea, but the taste was surprisingly delicious. It was better than expected."
1069,debutea-mini-new-york-3,2019-09-27,4.0,"Debutea has open a second location at the new 8SIA Food Hall. 

Checking out the menu of Fresh Fruit , Cheese and Boba I wasn't sure what to go for. Taro Boba with chunks of Taro and Brown Sugar , or the Grapefruit Harvest since I wasn't ready to try out Cheese Form for the first time.  But I also wanted the Mason Jar cup was was told they don't offer that other tan the Boba Brown Sugar Milk Tea. 

It's just a cup , didn't make since to me but I got it anyway. Plus you have to pay first at a central chashier and take you receipt back to get your tea.

From all of the Brown Sugar teas I had the one at Debutea has the strongest tea taste,  oolong ?  It was ok and made with lactose free milk that was no big deal me."
1069,debutea-mini-new-york-3,2019-10-11,4.0,"After eating lunch at this mini 8sia Food Hall the other day, it was time to explore their hot/cold tea selections. After staring at their menu and trying to better understand their vast offerings, I went with the fresh fruit tea and ordered their Strawberry Sunset, an ice cold concoction with Jasmine green tea and fresh strawberries. I must say it was very refreshing, and I'm curious if the cheese layer add-on option is a worthy must-try in the future. They had their own Point of Sale machine so dont have to use the central cashier and it accepts samsung, apple and android pay. Staff seemed friendly enough. It's wishful thinking but the Crave App offers discounts after 2:30pm for 2 of the other restaurants in this food hall. Hopefully that offering can extend here coming from a local resident that lives in the neighborhood."
1069,debutea-mini-new-york-3,2019-11-06,1.0,"By far the worst service I have ever received at a boba establishment. This is located inside of the 8SIA Food Hall on 42nd Street. Upon walking in, the cashier was on the phone and yelling at the person on the other line. No big deal but after a few minutes, she still did not acknowledge me. I was about to walk out before she asked if I wanted to order something. Nah, I'm just standing here for fun. 

Another woman came from another vendor came to make the drink. I was the only person waiting but she refused to give me the drink until the other woman confirmed to her that it was mine a minute later. Hello? I'm the only one in the entire food hall.

I ordered the Grapefruit Harvest Fruit Tea which is pretty tasty and refreshing; however, it wasn't anything special that you wouldn't be able to order from a different boba joint and definitely not worth the 0/5 customer service."
1069,debutea-mini-new-york-3,2019-10-22,5.0,"Couple awesome findings: 1, fruit tea is very fresh and non-artificial sugar, as you won't feel thirsty or too sweet after drinking. 2, Brown sugar boba tea is my fav, and they can make hot version for cold weather now. 3, To-go box is awesome for cup of four, very cute and convenient. 4, location is super close to subway and am able to place my order through ritual to skip lines. I heard they are opening Seamless, Uber eats and Postmates for delivery options, can't wait."
1069,debutea-mini-new-york-3,2019-10-29,5.0,"I am so happy that Debutea Mini opened near my home. Being a huge taro fan, I ordered the Taro Bobo Tea which consists of fresh taro and brown sugar boba with lactose-free milk. The barista was nice enough to inform me when I ordered that they use fresh taro and that it will be a bit more creamier than usual boba that has the taro powder. Since I had a similar drink before, it was not an issue for me but I found it very thoughtful of her because if someone never had that drink before, they might be taken by surprise. 
When I took my first sip, oh my goodness! the creaminess of the taro was so good! I wish the milk was a little more incorporated into the drink though as I felt like I was only eating taro towards the end.
My boyfriend ordered the Grape Wizard which consists of Oolong Tea with Fresh Crushed Grapes. My boyfriend is not a huge tea fan but he really liked the drink as well. I didn't expect them to blend so much real grapes in the drink. The drink was refreshing and the skin of the grapes were crunchy which I found the difference in textures interesting."
1069,debutea-mini-new-york-3,2019-10-25,4.0,"Quick, friendly service. Thoughtful packaging exhibits the photogenic color of the drinks. But the brown sugar boba in the Bobo Milk while nicely warmed were harder at the core than I'd like. I'd likely visit again for the other drinks on the menu."
1070,starbucks-new-york-194,2019-01-21,5.0,Great Starbucks that's right next to my office and is always very fast when ordering something. In a convenient location right by grand central and Bryant park. Definitely this place for a quick coffee. Better than the vast majority of places I've been to in the surrounding area.
1070,starbucks-new-york-194,2020-03-02,2.0,This starbucks is in a great location but what is the point of mobile orders if I have to wait over 20 mins for my drink? This has happened multiple times and its ridiculous

Next time I will request no ice to get what I'm paying for.  You pay $5 for a half cup of ice.  I had to add water after my first sip to feel like I actually drank something."
1070,starbucks-new-york-194,2019-03-10,1.0,"It's currently 6:15 and I'm volunteering for Cycle for Survival in NYC. I had to be at the location by 6:00am. This Starbucks location clearly states on that they open at 5:30am. I went to the Starbucks, the door was locked and they refused to let me in. I pointed to the time on the door where it says Sunday, 5:30. They look at me and said I know, we're sorry. It's extremely early and I've been volunteering for 12 hours Friday, Saturday and now today to help such an amazing cause. If your business is going to open at 5:30, they need to stick to their word. I'm pissed."

1070,starbucks-new-york-194,2019-02-08,5.0,I went there this morning and it was crazy busy yet staff were so kind and stepping up to help their customers.......#love up
1070,starbucks-new-york-194,2015-08-28,3.0,"Small space, but it seemed very clean. No one was very friendly, but hey, it's Starbucks. If I wanted a hug I'd go to one of those independent places. Mad props for letting me hang around for a while, but anti-props on two counts:

1 - No bathroom guys, really?
2 - botching both the flavor and size of my drink on the first go-round. They had it corrected in under a minute, but still. It was labeled correctly, there's just no focus."
1070,starbucks-new-york-194,2016-06-28,5.0,"I am at this Starbucks at least twice a day and Jamal, Jose and the rest of the team are always cheerful and blasting some funky tunes. Thank you guys for keeping my caffeine addiction going strong."

1070,starbucks-new-york-194,2014-01-27,5.0,"I came on to get my green tea latte fix at 6 am, which is early enough to make anybody grumpy. But not here! The manager (I believe) was very friendly and when I was about to buy the new via coffee pouches she gave me two for free! How sweet! My latte was also perfectly made ! :)"
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2018-10-14,5.0,"Loved my Joe and The Juice experience. We went in following a walk in Central Park. The first thing I noticed was the ample seating and the arrangement. It made it very cozy looking and inviting to stay after ordering. There were lots of photos around as well to look at as we waited for our order. 

We ordered 3 different drinks. There was a selection of sandwiches and also coffee. Hip hop music was playing in the background and the staff playfully danced around as they prepared our order. 

We were also pleased with our drinks. I went with the strawberry and banana with elderflower. It was really good. My cousin had a drink with turmeric in it. She actually considered ordering a second one since it was that good. My little cousin had a raspberry flavored d smoothie that she liked as well. 

After we left I noticed two more locations I hadn't noticed before. 

I will definitely try them out again!"
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-10-12,3.0,"Joe & Juice always seems to keep drawing me in. It has a clean spacious layout and cool branding.  The first problem is that they have one person working and a pretty inefficient operation.  Need a couple people here to get the orders out quicker. 

They do have a really clean store and a nice set up. I credit the management for doing a good job keeping it this way. It is also a quiet place if you want to get work done but the food and drinks are always under par. The yogurt is very average and has a runny consistency to it. I also tried the acai bowl and it was a little better than the yogurt. I don't drink smoothies or anything like that but I think that is what they are known for.

I will keep coming back here since it is convenient and a good place to get work done. Hopefully, I will find some food I like soon enough! We will see."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-04-17,5.0,This is a cute spot that has both coffee & juice which is such a great combo! I loved the ambiance as it was cozy & comfortable to just chill out in. The juice was great & just the way I wanted it. I def wana come back to try other things.
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2018-07-28,4.0,"This place is awesome for juice and shakes. I got the Power Shake and it was sooo good. It was the perfect consistency and thickness, and just tasted really really good. The whole atmosphere of the place is very modern and ~chill~. My friend got a juice which was also very very good. 
I would give this place a 5 if it weren't for the prices. The small cost me around 8 dollars and looked tiny! I attached a picture of the small size compared to the large size for reference. I recommend getting the larger size because it is around 2 dollars more, yet much bigger. Other than that, I would definitely go back to get another drink."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-05-17,3.0,"I've been to multiple locations and my experience has always been average. The juice is ok, quite expensive, but the space is great for working and the music is good. 

I waited over 35 minutes for a club sandwich (kept time using the time stamp on my receipt). I also asked the staff member if I could get some water, and went back to my table to get my own reusable water bottle. When I returned no one tended to me and after waiting for a minute I asked if I could get my water bottle filled up, to which another staff member said ""give me a second"" and went back to the order he was working on (I stood there for another full minute). 10 minutes later I come back to the counter with my bottle again and stood for another 20-30 seconds looking at the staff members to see if anyone would help me, and no one even looked my way. 

After 35 minutes I asked if my order was ready yet, and it turns out they forgot about it. Would like to see some improvements in this location..."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2018-06-08,5.0,"Delicious cold brew! My friend had a shot of chili that was an interesting twist to our morning coffee routine. Other caffeine options include lattes, coffee, and various hot/cold beverages.

They also have other options if you're not a caffeine lover, you can also find various juices and smoothies to your liking. The staff are great about making suggestions, substituting to suit your dietary restrictions and more!

Lots of seating, tables and lounge areas. Very close to other establishments! Would come back again!"
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2018-02-21,3.0,"I was excited to find that a new juice/smoothie shop opened in the UES area close by my job, but boy was I disappointed to have spent $10 on a small cup of blended acai....My expectations were a lot higher, for $10 they could have at least put some fruit to top if off. 

Despite the steep prices, the actual acai club was pretty tasty, and filling. Usually 2 hours after eating breakfast I find myself wanting to snack on something, but this filled me up, and didn't leave me wanting to snack throughout my morning. 

This Joe & the Juice location also loses points for wait time. When I ordered, I was the first and only customer in the store. However, people who came after me received their items before me. This was annoying because I ended up waiting a total of ten minutes for a bowl, which is pretty long considering I was the first to order, and no one else was in the store."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-04-22,5.0,"Joe & The JUICE is an excellent spot for soothing your smoothie sensations. It has a large selection of all types of juices, from energizers to recovery blends of fruits, vegetables and all the power foods that we love and adore. I would recommend this place to anyone on a juice craze and return again."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-08-13,2.0,"Over priced coffee BIG time! A cold brew, which tastes the same as any other iced coffee, was 5$!!! This place needs to up its quality or lower its prices."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2018-10-14,2.0,"I know juices are expensive .. but the amount of juice you get for the price is just crazy. The sandwiches that they offer look good, but at the time I was just in the mood for a juice. I would maybe come back here, but I don't think any juice is worth the price they are charging. 

I also got the cappuccino recently and it was horrible. It only tasted like milk and was over $4. I definitely won't be coming here again and will go to Oren's which is so close."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-07-26,5.0,Love it here!! Staff is the best I've seen- sooo friendly and efficient. My fave menu item is the Power Shake and I've never had to wait more than 2 minutes to receive it- definitely recommend this location!
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-11-04,2.0,"The product is good, decor is cute - but consistently wildly understaffed (at all Upper East Side locations), so the wait tome is horrendous. Literally ten out of ten times I've been here it's the same story. The owner would make more money if he didn't employ the fewest possible people to maximize profits as several people have walked out. Others vowing to never return with the ridiculous wait time. They will also not take orders over the phone in advance if one tries to circumvent this issue (as their juices/sandwiches truly are good!)"
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-07-26,5.0,"OK. Here's the deal...I'm reading these bad reviews and clearly these people are grumpy in the morning. I can tell you for a fact that there is not a coffee shop in the area with as much positive energy, quality coffee, good food, AND amazing staff as this place. I challenge you to find better in any category... As a resident of the block for 26 years, I can tell you to save your time looking, and get over there for your next cup of joe."

Has a lots of option to choose 
And price is reasonable.
Ambiance is nice!

Good thing is they have coffee too!!
So you can bring friends who don't feel like to drink a juice :)

Tastes always same and great 
It would be better they have more different kinds of  smoothies.
And almost every juice contains apple."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-05-23,5.0,"What a wonderful experience!!!! The staff were super good and the juices & sandwich is the best in NYC. 
Just the music is too much EDM. Need more well known songs from better artists."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2018-02-21,3.0,"Not sure why there are two Joe & the Juice's within a 15-block stretch on Lexington but hey, when a franchise is doing well, I can't begrudge its success. Plus, all the pretty social media pictures don't hurt (which is how I first found out about it ... no shame). But, while the juice was certainly colorful and tasty, I have a few nits: 

(1) The music was BOOMING. I love 90s pop as much as the next person but it was hard to think and work and have a conversation. I noticed how the employees had to keep asking for orders to be repeated back. Maybe lowering the volume would help? Speaking of ...

(2) The guys behind the counter seemed a bit more focused on playing with their phones and talking with each other. Meh, whatever. I just want my drink. And I get that not everyone needs to be effusively excited about whatever product they're slinging, but, in a new chain, that kind of enthusiasm would have been soul-warming to see. The too-cool-for-school airs were annoying. 

(3) The granola in the yogurt bowls could use just a little more sweetness. I ended up crumbling some spare Nature Valley granola bars into the yogurt. 

I only really stopped in here to see what the fuss was about and I'm not sure I'd come back, if only because the juices are in the high range and I can always just eat an apple to get the vitamins."

Juice in the morning is best thing 
But sadly my neighborhood Joe & the juice is not provide the decent service not the juice is taste mediocre"

Most importantly,great coffee."

The server was so rude to me and starting swearing at me because I questioned him about my order and he went crazy on me with all the customers there!!!  I would watch and make sure you are getting everything in your order when you go into this location!!!
He refused to give me his name or the managers name!! 
I hope the owner of this establishment reads this and finds out who this employee is working a five o'clock shift!!!

So surprised to see someone with their snow boots on the table at Joe & The Juice today. Came in for a shake and wanted to sit at a table to enjoy it but, had to leave when I saw someone place their feet in wet snow boots directly atop the table meant for eating."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-06-19,2.0,"Great coffee and smoothies but very unreliable hours.  Sometimes I walk by after 7a and they're open and sometimes (like today), I walked there at 745a and it's closed and no one is even there opening up.

Must be poorly managed."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-06-04,1.0,"I should have read the reviews. Go elsewhere. The breakfast smash was a glaze of smash on a cracker (a tiny piece of bread flattened to cracker status in the panini maker). My order of green juice (cucumber, lemon, pineapple, with protein added) was 50%+ water and I'm pretty sure no protein added. That was difficult to tell with the watered down consistency. The cost of my prized items ($20)."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-07-18,1.0,Horrible Customer Experience.  Baristo not focused on service only was focused talking to a pretty girl.   He was extremely focused on impressing her.   He was playing his own music on his iPad over the store's speaker system and was picking super loud explicit rap music.... which was not a good experience for everyone there.   I spent 4.00 on a weak iced coffee... while he has making my coffee he proceeded to blow his nose with a paper towel and threw it right on the counter next to my open coffee cup.   Not impressed.  Hire people who care.
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-04-27,1.0,"Walked in - this guy behind counter waits for my order, after i pay he told me they were out of pesto which every single sandwich has on it. Awesome. Then he says I'll call you when it's ready.....there is 1 other person in the restaurant at a chair - I proceed to sit and wait, and watch this guy text and stand there on his phone for 7 entire minutes, do you know how long 7 minutes is in quiet when you are sitting waiting for a panini? He finally makes it - somehow it's cold and missing tomato - $9 panini, $1 tip and 12 minutes of my life ---- down the drain"
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-05-12,1.0,"We dealt with the snarky manager who couldn't care less if we were there at all. We ordered two sandwiches that had a price of $8.90 each but our receipt showed $9.69. When I asked the manager why, he told me the $9.69 included tax, however, after the subtotal on the bill, they charged tax AGAIN. SO BEWARE THAT IT APPEARS THEY ARE CHARGING TAX TWICE AND INFLATING THE BILL ABOUT 8.7%!!!  
The snarky manager did not deny this and said it wasn't his doing but the management company. 
Be sure to compare your receipt to the posted price and see if they are charging tax on a tax. 
I know I will get a standard BS reply to this post but nothing will be done until the government  steps in."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-12-06,1.0,"Ordered a ""power shake"" at the 72nd and Lexington location. Had heard the quality of Joe & the Juice was very good. What an absolute disappointment! 
I watched them put some pale, mushy looking strawberries (read: yellow and pink) in with some banana and ice & was stunned to see them add ""Vanilla Ice Cream Milk"" to the mixture. I stopped the employee & asked if I could just get frozen yoghurt, almond milk, or even regular milk, but it was too late. Paid my $7.90 (!!) for a small & sat down. It tasted horrible. Anyone who makes smoothies knows they're as good as the fruit you use, and this tasted as bad as the strawberries looked. 
After a couple of sips, I went up to the counter and said basically that it tasted terrible and could I possibly get a refund. No. Why? Because they had served many that day and no one had complained. That it was my taste buds !!
They did offer to make a different shake, but after tasting the first, I wasn't about to risk a second. 
A quality smoothie- one worth that price- would've had fresh, HEALTHIER ingredients then what they're selling. 
Don't bother. So disappointed."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2017-08-04,5.0,"I came here earlier this morning with my friend to avoid the rain and while we were sitting here we ordered a couple of their juices. I ordered the breakfast club which was like a cross between a juice and a smoothie bowl(?) It had raspberry, avocado, banana and something else (I think) with granola on top and my friend ordered the sex something drink with ginger and other fruit. 

Overall they were good and refreshing. I wasn't too crazy about the ginger drink because I'm not really crazy about Ginger but I didn't mind drinking it. I liked my breakfast club it was quite refreshing, although I wish it were a little sweeter because it was kind of tart but that's probably because of the raspberry, but it's fine. 

I definitely want to applaud the two workers at that time there was a sh*t ton of people that came in the same time we did so they were working their butts off. However when it finally died down it became a lot more chill and I think they were very friendly and funny. I like the guy that was singing next to us while he was making the drinks, he had great energy for a gloomy morning. Anyway, great juice and vibes here!"
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-04-11,5.0,"Love this chain, especially this particular branch. The coffee is delicious. I'm sure the food is too because it smells amazing, will probably try it out soon. Love the interiors and the seating area, great for reading/working or even meeting up with people. The WiFi connection is also great. The staff is very friendly and the service is good. Planning to make it a regular spot."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2017-09-16,3.0,"Seen this juice chain around the city and stopped in this UES location for a quick bite. Wanted something a little more filling, so I went with one of their hand shake options. The Easy Shake caught my eye because don't see many smoothies with mint. It also has banana and vanilla milk. Came out pretty quick and I'd have to say that it's great and the mint adds a refreshing flavor to it. Wish I got the 16oz since the 12oz is a bit smaller than I hoped and the larger size seems like a better deal. 

Also got the Serrano sandwich and it's good, but hardly had any filling to it. Probably will stick to just juices and smoothies here. For that reason I'm just doing 3 stars, because everything else was great but the sandwiches aren't worth it and it's a tad pricey."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2017-06-14,5.0,"Juices here are solid & on point with fresh veggies being brought out from the back. I saw this place in a few places while traveling around the city & finally had the chance to sit down and relax. 

Vibes here on point. Soulful music and upbeat personality of workers make the place very inviting to stop in, work, or have a drink with a friend.

I'd definitely stop here again the next time I'm in the city!"
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2018-07-17,1.0,This 'turkey sandwich' was ten dollars. I've lived in NYC for ten years and have overpaid for a lot of things but this takes the cake. Disappointing. It's comical to look at the business owner's pictures posted on here - you can see the difference between their turkey sandwich used for marketing purposes and the one you actually receive. Pathetic.
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-08-17,1.0,"Juice is fine but staffing is absurd. It's one poor person trying to do everything and the waits are absurd.  This is an issue with whoever is managing and staffing, not the actual person working there. Juice is juice, it's good. No secret formula."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2018-02-04,2.0,"Had double shot espresso and it tasted so bad, like burned cigarette. Also made me sick. My friend got single shot espresso and also felt sick afterwards. It's a cool place with nice decor, and a lot of people are here with their laptops and working, since they have comfortable chairs, but I can't say the same about the coffee."

My problem with this location is the service, which is pretty slow, when isn't even that busy, which is a bummer when you're running on the clock for school or work. The staff isn't too friendly, at least the one taking the orders. One time he had a line of 5 people waiting, while he was on the phone. The bathroom is a total mess, always dirty which is not pleasant at 8 am in the morning."

Tuna-cado sandwhich and a large black iced coffee please!"
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2019-07-20,4.0,"I love Joe & The Juice in general, but this location is the one I have visited most frequently. The space is well designed, with plenty of area for people to sit and enjoy their juices, smoothies, or meals. In the summer, the A/C is always cranking and so it's always great to be able to escape the hot weather inside. They have food, juices, and smoothies - they have an excellent selection of smoothies and juices. Everything is freshly made and the smoothies are delicious. The staff is also friendly and helpful."
1071,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-24,2018-05-24,5.0,"Love this place! I usually come here to grab lunch. 

The juices & smoothies are great, a little pricey but every place in the upper east side is. Also try a ginger shot, one of the best. Spicy yet super flavorful. 

The chicken club or spicy tuna are my favorite on gluten free bread. The people that work there are super nice! They always welcome you with a special on their face and are really nice. The decor is funky with fun music. 

Great spot for a quick lunch"

Had a deliciously healthy juice (forgot the name) served by a very friendly waitress. Got a chance also to talk to the managers about an app we were building. They were also very friendly and helpful. 

I highly recommend this place for it's overa quality and vibe."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2019-12-27,5.0,I went in for an issue with a defective bottle I purchased last month and shift supervisor Shaquanna King went above and beyond to resolve my issue. She helped me quickly and I appreciate her ability to help. This establishment is lucky to have someone who's so well versed in customer service. Happy holidays!
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2019-03-12,4.0,"They messed up my order. I asked for cinnamon macchiato and they made me a caramel instead. However, the barista  apologized and made me a cinnamon, as well as letting me have the caramel for free."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2019-10-17,1.0,"Ugh I've made the mistake of placing a mobile order at this location twice now. Instead of a latte and a flat white, I've ended up with a hot cup of milk each time! You could not taste the coffee one bit. Even the flat white, which normally has a strong, creamy espresso taste, literally just tasted like a warm cup of milk. Please train your employees. Definitely not coming back here!"
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2017-10-01,5.0,"So I come here only once - maybe twice - a week if anything.  I usually end up getting the same thing every time and the baristas have never messed up my order.  They also remember me by name since I'm a Gold Card member I guess.

No complaints from me"
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2018-06-20,2.0,"I don't like Starbucks, too expensive and too much hype around their products. But, once in a while I get a random craving for a caramel macchiato and no one else makes it like them... but the service at this location sucks! They are slow and lack basic customer service skills, this visit was a great reminder to me to stay away!"
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2019-02-12,1.0,"Rude and nasty employees. I have never been to such an unhappy and negative atmosphere. About 5 employees behind the counter, with only me as a client. Making jokes and looking at me as if I was bothering them. When I asked a question? No answer, a silent menu was given to me. I left! Keep up the horrific job!"
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2015-04-01,4.0,"Starbucks,  Starbucks,  Starbucks, so many to choose from where I worked,  with the same coffees and menu.  Some have sandwiches and other food items and some do not.

So the reason I like this Starbucks compared to the others nearby is that the staff is helpful and do the little extras that make a difference,  They make me Toffee flavor lattes and Frappuccinos even if it's not on the menu. They ask for my name so that there is no confusion when 3 people step up for the same latte. And they get your coffee to you fast."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2018-02-25,4.0,"Being in Midtown East in between various offices, this Starbucks becomes very busy at key times: 
7:30 - 9:30 AM
1:30 PM - 3:00 PM

If you come here during these hours, be prepared to wait on line and wait for your order. It's annoying, but a reality for the location. The alternative is to order from the Starbucks application and have it ready when you arrive. 
The reason why I give this place 3 stars is because the Partners are kind, despite the pressures of the crowds and location. An example: one of the barista recently spent time talking to me about the new Blonde Espresso. She recommended I give it a try and described it so well. She offered to remake my drink with regular espresso if I do not enjoy it with the Blonde espresso. That's excellent service. In case you're wondering what I did, I kept the drink and now the blonde espresso is my go to espresso. I prefer this Starbucks to others in the area."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2017-11-02,1.0,"Now I come to this Starbucks a few times a week and usually order a Venti tea. Nothing crazy that requires time to prepare like frappes and lattes. The last few weeks when I stop by in the morning, I am made to wait much longer than anyone else who order more labor intensive beverages.

I find this unacceptable because who has time in the morning to wait around for 15-20 minutes for hot water and a tea bag?? When I asked after my order, I was told it would be ready shortly but a few minutes later and it's still nowhere near ready. I was literally just on time when I arrived at work. 

From a customer standpoint, I find this to be the most aggravating experience. Management- perhaps your crew needs additional training on providing orders in a timely fashion?"
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2018-06-06,1.0,"I just started working near this location..it's ok but the morning rush is super annoying and the set up makes no sense.  They have the bar where you put your milk and sugar in the coffee right near the front where people are waiting for their drinks.  Doesn't make sense to me at all.

ETA:  I will never go here again.  Went at a totally off time (3 PM) and had to wait over twenty min for a simple caramel macchiato."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2017-01-31,2.0,"I order a small latte and when the barista left it on the counter-without acknowledging that it was my drink as he was talking to his friends-it was a large or a tall or whatever Starbucks' has named its ridiculous sizes. I asked him to remake it since I didn't want that much milk, he does--he doesn't offer my change I'm owed for the mistake he's made. 

I walk out, somewhat annoyed but assuming he'll take the difference as tip which I'm fine with as he did remake my drink with minimal issue.  

I get to my car and take a bite of my choc. chip cookie..most stale cookie I've ever tasted. 

I never normally go to Starbucks and now I've been reminded why."

1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2018-01-09,1.0,Every time I go here I'm disappointed. They get my order wrong every time or they forget about my order. How hard is it to put hot water in a cup for TEA? unfortunately this Starbucks is right below my office but this is a last resort for me as I usually make my own tea or coffee in the am. I hope they improve.
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2015-08-02,4.0,"I'm writing this review to combat some of the terrible reviews that I saw. I cannot give it five stars because it's tiny--it's one of the smallest Starbucks you'll find so the selection of extras is not always stocked and there is very limited seating. But the point is to get coffee not to move in. And the staff here is always pleasant. 

If you're looking for your coffee to go, it's as good as any."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2017-11-21,1.0,I used to love going to this Starbucks every morning but now I try to avoid getting my breakfast from here. I order through the app so I can walk in and grab my order right before work. I order about ten minutes before i get there and lately i still have to wait at least ten more minutes in there. My drink is usually ready but as far as food they are so SLOW. I never knew it took so long to toast a bagel. Half the time they forget what my order was so it defeats the purpose of ordering ahead. This location needs to get it together!
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2017-01-07,5.0,The barista or should I say baristo Nas went above and beyond to make my tea how I asked. Great service! Thank you Nas for being so kind and patient. Nice smile too. :)
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2017-08-08,1.0,"Ok so I come here pretty much everyday before work and the last few days I've been ordering the same thing. Now today when I ordered the barista didn't know the recipe, which is fine as it's something off the secret menu and I had the recipe. So instead of asking me she asked another barista who told her the exact recipe. She gave up making my drink halfway through and passed it off to the other girl, still that's ok. Now upon getting my order it was missing honey which they later gave me. After already leaving and getting to work I realized that the tea tasted off, that's because it was the wrong tea, not ok. I heard the other barista tell the girl the exact Tea to put and she some how still got it wrong, very aggravating."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2014-01-22,4.0,"This spot is ok for a quick buy and leave. If you are looking for area to sit and relax, I would recommend to go to Astor Place off the 6 line. 

Why 4 stars? Well customer service played the part.  All staff are friendly and willing to go an extra mile, especially the managers. Hopefully, this will not change in the future."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2017-03-10,5.0,"This morning I went this Starbucks for a coffee without wallet but only Starbucks phone app. However when I want to pay, the phone died because of the damn cold weather. I was so embarrassed, but the baristas (all of them) there tell me it is ok and shows understanding and even treat me with a free coffee. Let me feel so warmed in today's cold weather."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2014-04-13,4.0,"Most Starbucks are similar, but they are not all alike.  As a frequent coffee drinker, a few things can make one stand out over another.  First and foremost are the people working there.  At the Starbucks on 3rd near 47th, the people who work here are on top of the operation.  Sometimes, there's a lot of chatter and socializing behind the counter among employees, which leads to the need to repeat your order 3 or 4 times, orders being forgotten, getting orders wrong and slow service.  Not so here.  Each morning, I walk in, step up, and they are ready and paying attention.  The coffee drinks are made quickly and they get it right each time.

Add to this that this particular location is fairly roomy (for NYC) and centrally located in East Midtown, and you have a coffee place worth stopping at each morning."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2013-07-23,3.0,"Good Starbucks, but the couch chairs are a bit awkward. Service was nice and otherwise a typical starbucks"

1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2017-05-26,1.0,"I tried to go to a bathroom before leaving a store. The guy at Starbuck said that you cannot use a bathroom. It is employee only. But, I saw a white lady used it. I am Asian. Is this discrimination? Or this shop has really ""employee only bathroom""??? if so, sounds weird to me at Starbucks. I should confirm with a head office."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2014-08-17,2.0,Unfriendly and really bad service compared to other Starbucks in the city. I always go to Starbucks to do work but the baristas here were not pleasant here and I will not go back.
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2017-02-22,1.0,"My cappuccino was made by Debbie, the shift supervisor.  She never made it--she just poured coffee halfway and charged $3.76! I left and went home and realized I didn't even get a cappuccino or anything close to it. I had to go back again, and explain it to the working staff and asked me to open the lid.  They made a new one, and told them I have never experienced this at any Starbucks before.  What I have experienced is the rude and passive-aggressive behavior by Debbie before. She always seems unhappy and it reflects on her service and job.  And, in this case, she just lied to not serve me what I paid for.  Because of the convenience factor, this is the place I go to, but really, there are many good Starbucks in the city and in the world--service and quality. Not this one.  When the supervisor Debbie casts a poor tone, I am not surprised this Starbucks on 3rd Avenue has such poor ratings and reviews.  Avoid this one."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2014-05-08,4.0,"Best morning Latte!!!  They get it right every time!  Their service is pretty fast considering the line goes out the door in the morning!  They have a minimal seating, WiFi, a bathroom, and a friendly staff."

1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2009-03-06,1.0,"Honestly, why do people bother with this garbage?  Burnt beans, nasty crap they try to pass off as coffee.  Everything thats actually tasty is sugary as all hell and costs over $5 bucks.  I cannot bother with this anymore even though it is the most convenient place for coffee in the afternoon by my job.

By the way, I don't like being corrected when I order something.  If i ask for a double shot of espresso, do not look at me quizically and say ""doppio"" as if you didn't know what i meant when i said ""double.""  If the company is from seattle, why am i using italian words to order my coffee in New York?"
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2010-10-14,3.0,"The second competent Starbucks I know in Manhattan. And that's saying a lot. 

The Basics, that most Starbucks can't hit:
- They get the drinks right!
- They make the drinks well! 
- They AREN'T INCOMPETENT! (i.e. they don't mess up, they're relatively speedy, etc)

The Extras, that give it that extra star or two:
- They remember your name, and greet you with it every day. It's charming, and makes me feel like it was worth the extra detour before work. 
- They smile and make an effort to connect with you even though it's early and you're still grumpy
- They TELL you if there's going to be a delay - ""we've only got one barista, so lattes will take longer today. If you don't have time to wait, you shouldn't order one, we're sorry."" Much, much appreciated."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2015-04-17,4.0,"Up until recently I worked in an office building near this Starbucks, so I've visited it too many times to count. This is not a Starbucks to relax and hang out in - it is small with limited seating availability. But as a grab and go, it is great. Even when there is a line, the baristas keep things moving and always have a friendly attitude. :)"
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2014-07-29,1.0,Wish I could leave negative stars. Have this place another try. Still the slowest and worst Starbucks around. Morning rush and 2 people working while 2 others do nothing
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2011-07-25,1.0,"This is the closest starbucks to where I work and it is HORRIBLE.  Everytime (and I really do mean, EVERY time) I go in there they give me the wrong size drink: If I order a grande, they give me a tall - If I order a venti, they give me a grande.  Then when I tell them about it, all they do is pour it into the bigger cup and add more ice.  

Also, the service is slow and the people who work there are SO rude.  They are always talking/awkwardly flirting with each other and it takes them 5 minutes to realize that you are standing there waiting to order.  The last time I went in there, the cashier was horrible: she said to me ""What do you want?"" and then spoke to me in a nasty tone the whole time.  When her colleague asked her what drink I ordered she said, ""I don't know... black tea, green tea, lemonade, whatever...""  She also rang up the wrong price and when I inquired she said ""Oh yeah well I was gonna give you the right change after you gave me the money anyway..""  WHAT?  That is just ridiculous.

Next time I need a coffee break, I'll walk the extra 2 blocks down in the other direction instead.

Horrible."
1072,starbucks-new-york-155,2013-12-13,3.0,Nice and friendly staff. Clean facility. But no outlets to charge your gadgets. Just yourself.

I stopped in to this Starbucks today and was pleasantly surprised that the workers were efficient and friendly. The place wasn't super packed either, which is always a nice surprise during lunch hours on a weekday in midtown manhattan."
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2017-05-05,4.0,"I used to go here a lot. I'm currently deciding if I want to stay a starbucks member or switch over to dunkin donuts. They keep the store very clean, they're  constantly wiping down counters, changing the trash, etc. It can get pretty packed here sometimes but that's why I love the mobile order app. It's so easy and convenient!

I read some reviews about the staff members. Yes, sometimes they like to joke around but doesn't everyone do that at work every now and then? It's what makes your job more enjoyable.  It's not like they're always joking around. When you start coming here as a regular, they already memorized your order and know how you like your beverage. When you walk in the door, they don't even need to say anything and pass you your order. It's the best and so efficient!

Occasionally it will taste like burnt coffee, most of the time it hits the spot perfectly."
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2019-09-09,2.0,"Worst customer service. Waited 20 minutes on my latte in an empty starbucks at 9:00 am. I asked for a salted caramel latte with oat milk, extra shot of espresso and sausage & cheddar but she totally ignored it and made me just regular salted caramel mocha. I told them that I ordered latte not mocha she said mocha and latte are the same things. Okay. I also asked for an oat milk cashier started arguing with me saying that I didn't tell her that. I have a lactose intolerance you will tell me I forgot to tell you?! Then I told her that I was still waiting on my sandwich her response was: What sandwich? Then I had to wait on them to make drinks for everyone who ordered after me before they started making my drink again, which took them another 10 minutes. And when I told them that I had to go and asked for refund they finally made my drink. Hallelujah!"
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2018-02-06,1.0,"I used to live by this Starbucks and it has some of the rudest and laziest employees that I ever witnessed.  They are nasty and don't have common sense.  I have seen everything at this Starbucks, from being ignored while they are chatting with each other, or one time when their was a Trainee clearly struggling taking our order and the actual worker couldn't be bothered and left him alone to go wipe down where the napkins are and eventually had to come over and help him 5 minutes later because he couldn't input our drinks into the register. 

There was one particularly nasty woman that I've dealt with multiple times. I asked for Pike for my coffee (due to dark roast giving me heart burn) and the employee took my order and was asking the woman if they had Pike left and she said ""No just give her dark roast."" In which I had to interject, ""no don't give me dark roast, I will go somewhere else.""  

Another time, with the same woman, my father ordered a grande coffee in a venti cup and she didn't want to do it, acted confused and just plain nasty. 

I also can't tell you how many times I'll be standing at the register while the employees are more concerned with chatting with each other than actually making drinks or taking orders. Skip this Starbucks, there are plenty to go around."
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2016-11-14,4.0,"Nice location. It's not too big but it also doesn't get too crowded either.
There's probably half a dozen tables and a few counter seats. 
The staff is nice and the service is quick. 
I usually don't get the food but they have a full selection of pre made stuff as well as hot sandwiches. It looked like they had all the accessories too, cups, hot cups, etc."

Few things to note: 

(1) Somehow, they actually had a lot of seats available and open on a Saturday afternoon, last time I was here. 2PM to be exact. 
(2) They don't blast the music on like it is a dance club. Hence, you can accomplish reading and studying. You can FOCUS.
(3) There are a lot of windows to allow for natural lighting in addition to providing a great view for people watching. Or, people sketching, if you are an artist.
(4) There are outlets right by and under your seats, and they are not 2 feet away from you.
(5) So far, no random stranger has come up to my table, sat down, and started talking about themselves.

Compared to a lot of Starbucks, I think this is a rather fine location."

The staff is actually very friendly and this location is kept clean for the most part. The line goes by quite fast and there are a few seats available for people to sit down, relax, and decide where they want to go next.  

If Starbucks is good at anything, it is the ability to provide the convenience of a specific brand of beverage on almost any given block. For that, I am always grateful."

However, each SB does have specific unique traits as listed below.  Here are my personal thoughts on this SB: 

- Staff - Can I get a smile. 
- Cleanliness - They could use some improvements in this area.  
- Location - Easy access if your walking (as most people do in NY)
- Seating area fits about 10 max."
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2015-12-24,1.0,"I would give 0 stars.. unfortunately I can't.

My friends and I arrived at the store. We had just finished a nice dinner at a restaurant nearby and we were craving something nice and hot to drink. Since one of us had a Starbucks gift card, she offered to buy the rest of us drinks from there. We walk into the store; there was no greeting from the staff. All we heard as we walked in was ""Let us know what you're going to order, we'll take it from this side"" (We were standing on the line but they asked us from behind the espresso machines.) So we gave them our orders. I ordered a Tall Hot Chocolate, but after ordering my hot chocolate maybe like a few seconds after, I switched the size of the drink to a Grande. The barista seemed a little confused as to what I was saying. Finally, that issue got sorted out. After all ordering our drinks, the barista went to the registers and another barista had appeared. She was and African-American woman wearing a white button-down, and had long hair past her shoulder and maybe came midway to her arms (?) [I can't remember correctly.] She started making the drinks and then she asked if we wanted the Chestnut Praline Latte (a drink my friend ordered) with whip cream or not. First of all, we ordered a TALL Chestnut Praline Latte and not a GRANDE. She still proceeded to give us the Grande. She had TOLD us that we would be charged the TALL price since it was their mistake. Ok fine, we believed her. But what was really unsettling during all this, was her ATTITUDE. As she was asking us if we want whip cream or not, (we were confused about the drink and thought it was someone else's' due to the wrong size of the cup) she kept raising her voice and the tone started to turn a little forceful with some anger and she slams the whip cream container onto the table (?). Is that a type of behavior we should see in a Starbucks?  She slammed the container in front of us and I was personally very shocked to see this type of violent behavior. I believe that this was an incident where violence or anger should not have been aroused. My other friend, who went to the register to pay for the transaction, was appalled. The total of the transaction for 3 drinks had come out to $15.00. They still charged us for the Grande Chestnut Praline instead of the tall price that they said they would. The quality of the drinks was also very poor. The drinks came out COLD. My hot chocolate was also bitter. This was a very upsetting experience at a Starbucks. I never complained about an experience to any Starbucks I have been too. Something needs to be done about the employees who work at this Starbucks."

These guys are open early and on the weekends, which is really useful if you're in to work early and need coffee for you OR if you're stuck organizing a meeting nearby. On a Saturday morning, some of the nicest staff helped me get a few boxes of coffee, loaded me down with shopping bags full of cups, sugars and milks to set up a sweet coffee bar in our conference room. All of these things are included in the $15 per jug rate."

1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2016-05-27,5.0,SOOOO much better than the big Sbux on 3rd Ave. between 52nd 53rd. Too many bad tasting drinks from there and the freakishly long and slow moving lines. I really like this location because the baristas have memorized my drink order by now and they're always nice! I can see why some people think the baristas here have attitude but I'm a regular customer and I've never had an issue. Sometimes this location gets really busy and congested especially during weekends and weekday afternoons but the line seems to move fast.

Best part about this location is that they have a good ventilation system!!!!! Idk what it is about Starbucks that always leaves me smelling like a sandwich or something and I absolutely hate it!!!!! This location does no such thing. Idk maybe it's just me who was noticed this smell that sticks to you're clothes after leaving Starbucks lol! Any-who.....

The barista's are very friendly here too and the bathroom is well maintained which is great!"

Starbucks is a company that prides itself on customer experience (according to The Power of Habit book I'm reading), and I'd expect some customer service with my $3 coffee. ...But what I got was brief eye contact from the lady at the register, which prompted me to order. She looked down, didn't acknowledge me at all, and fiddled with her drawer for 15 seconds without saying anything, then rang me up. She didn't say the total, just pointed at the scanner for my Starbucks app. No receipt, no thank you, and no calling my name when my ice coffee was ready. 

The place is pretty clean, although I had to clear the table myself to sit down. There's wifi. It's the same as most other Starbucks, just with really rude staff."
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2015-04-22,3.0,"its starbucks, and in any direction that your feet will take you, its a good chance you will bump into a starbucks . this location is not that big , but every  available space has seating with people texting or geeking away on their computer. the place is always kept clean and counter is well stocked with  condiments for your hot or cold coffee or tea, and front counter display has all goodies displayed nicely. the folks who work here seem to be nice enough with customers and even when lines are long , they move quickly.
i usually take my blueberry scones and venti decaff cappy to go, because the geeks order the minimum and stay the maximum, (damn the free wifi ) and their is no available seating left. the music is at a easy to listen level and music playing is usually for sell at front counter. the pastries are always fresh when i come early in the morning, same for the bagels. i enjoy the drinks, but at times my tummy does rumble on occasions.
this place is nearby my city apts,so it serves a purpose when i am in my starbucks mood, decent coffee, pastries and good service. 3 stars.

p.s. i purchased a spill proof coffee tumbler for my buddy porcelli (geeky slob) cause he is always spilling beverages on his clothing like a baby."
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2016-05-20,1.0,"Waaaaaay too much attitude. They play way too much and because of that, orders are NEVER right. I've come here 6 times because unfortunately its the only one near my office. I specify my drink ever time and ever single time it isnt right and i get attitude. Rolling of the eyes. They curse with one another in front of customers and i for 1 will never be back here again. I'd rather walk over to lexington where the service is much more sufficient"
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2016-06-26,1.0,"This place is never opened on time, especially on weekend mornings. Three times in the past two weeks I have went to the store only to have it closed for up to one hour of the opening time posted on the front door. Twice the barista who was waiting outside stated ""my manager is running late again"". When the place is open the service is fine and the coffee is always fresh and hot.                                                              Gave this Starbucks another chance this past Sunday morning 6/26. I was happy to see that it was opened on time as advertised the service was fine and the coffee was fresh, hot, and brewed to perfection !"
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2016-09-06,1.0,"Tons of attitude. My breakfast order has been forgotten about multiple times and when I ask about it after I see a whole line of people empty out, I get eye rolls, no apology and feel as if I had made the mistake by their cold body language. On top of that, the food is basically garbage once I get it because it's too burnt. Last time I'll be going to this location."
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2015-06-11,1.0,"The cashier could not understand that the girl in front of me was trying to explain that she would be using what was left on her Starbucks card to pay for her order and make up what was left in cash. Took forever. I've never been to a Starbucks that has rude (hostile?) employees that do not greet you, say thank you or you're welcome. If you're dealing with the public, aren't you supposed to have just a shred of decorum? Has corporate forgotten this store exists?  The store is tiny, very dirty and very hot inside. Couldn't believe this was a Starbucks."
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2014-04-16,4.0,"This is one of the closest Starbucks to my job, so when I go for a walk, I usually pop in for an afternoon drink. The baristas are super friendly and on point here."
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2012-05-15,2.0,"I tried to squeeze in one more Starbucks run before the Frappuccino Happy Hour ended a couple days ago. Prior to walking over, I looked at the different flavors I could get on the Starbucks website, and I ultimately decided that I wanted to try the cinnamon dolce frappuccino, which is not on their standard menu boards, but IS on the website, so therefore all locations should know how to make it. This isn't part of any secret menu that everyone was buzzing about recently. Who knows is that one is even true?

There was a long line when I came at 3:45ish, but the line didn't move too unbearably slowly. There was a group before me, and I overheard the guy in front of me asking for a raspberry green tea. Two baristas that were manning the cashiers looked at each other in confusion and were asking questions left and right to try to figure out what he wanted or if they would even be able to make it. There was a third barista who seemed to be frantically running around making all the drinks as the first two scratched their heads.

When it came for me to order, I asked for the cinnamon dolce frappuccino. The barista said that they don't have that flavor, but I protested, stating that it was on the menu. She asked the aforementioned third barista, and he said that he was able to make it: some pushback, but eventual success.

While I was waiting for my receipt to be printed, one of the baristas asked for the female customer next in line's order. The lady apparently had a very complex order, but as she started to describe what she wanted (with a shot of this, decaf that, skim this, and a sprinkle of that), the barista who was supposed to be taking her order walked away. How do you expect to make an order that you didn't even listen to? If you weren't ready to take the order or weren't planning on paying attention, why did you start asking the customer what she wanted?

I felt really bad for the barista who was making almost all of the drinks because he seemed to be the only one who knew what he was doing. He was holding down the fort while the other two were twiddling their thumbs. This location needs to get their head on straight and learn about their products and also how to interact in a fast-paced environment involving an exchange with customers."
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2014-09-10,1.0,Slowest Starbucks in all of NYC! Always has been. If it wasn't right outside my door I wouldn't go here.
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2013-08-18,2.0,Overpriced acidic bitter coffee. Staff can't make a decent espresso even with those expensive machines from Italy .
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2014-12-04,1.0,"This is by far the worst Starbucks ever.
The rude and angry cashier who did't hand me back my credit card, the rude barista who was so busy flirting with a customer that she failed  to give me my drink...will never be back."
1073,starbucks-new-york-367,2016-07-27,1.0,Ordered my beverage with the prepaid app.  Got to the store to pick up and they gave my order to another customer.  Had to wait for my order and it was so rushed that it was made incorrectly told the batista and was ignored..called starbucks corporate office..was promised a credit in 5 minutes..still waiting..emailed corporate..still waiting
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2015-01-31,4.0,"I'm giving this place 4 stars because I got a vanilla latte today and damn was it GOOD with a capital G. I've come in here previously and was always disappointed because this place was messy and the drinks were burnt beyond repair. How is it humanly possible to have a messy Starbucks when this is a new location? 

Here is how. This place doesn't seem to be properly staffed and i think that's why it gets messy and the staff that is here doesn't proactively clean on a periodic basis throughout the day. They seem hell bent on staying behind the register even when there are no customers to serve.  Use the down time to clean! 4 stars for not being a disappointment today."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2020-01-26,2.0,So... pre order a mixed drink and its ready when u get there.  PreOrder a pike regular coffee...expect to wait 5-10minutes.  I thought it was a one time deal.  This is my 3rd time with same exact issue
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2018-10-14,2.0,Waited in line to order for about 10 minutes (only 4 people in front of me). During this time I noticed little fruit flys buzzing around the food display - quite appetizing. Then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for a basic green tea. Disappointing location.
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2019-06-25,4.0,Convenient location right across from my gym. I use the mobile app so my orders come out quickly and correct. Can't complain.
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2019-09-26,5.0,FRANK FOR MANAGER This would be a good idea since the place opens on time when he is there and it runs so smooth. Now without Frank no 5 stars possibly 2
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2018-11-14,5.0,"The manager was very nice, I forgot his name. He's a short Hispanic guy, was very nice and the girl who took our order as well. It was quiet and clean at this location. Great service, he deserves a raise!"
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2018-12-16,2.0,"This is the nearest Starbucks to my home and the location is convenient. However, they always have new baristas don't know how to make the drinks, even the basic ones like Caramel Macchiato. When it's for the seasonal drinks, sometimes I have to tell them what needs to be added in. Starbucks really need to provide better trainings for its employees!!"
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2017-12-24,1.0,"Worst. 
Service. 
Ever.
With attitude. 
Not at all what I think Starbucks stands for."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2019-04-20,1.0,OMG what is happening here. Every item of the 3 was wrong. The Java Chip Frap was so watered down. Do you not teach the baristas how to make the products correctly. Very very sad and nobody cares
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2017-06-10,4.0,Helpful staff with the typical Starbucks fare.  Doesn't have the cool vibe of some of their other spots as it's small.  Great location though on W. 42nd between 8th and 9th. For a small place they did manage to have a decent amount of seating including a long counter in the center of the space as well as chairs along the edges.
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2018-03-07,5.0,"No idea what happened but there was only one barista here on a Saturday night. We were on our way from Port Authority to Terminal 5 when we stopped by to grab some coffee to wake us up. The older gentleman handling the register was also the only barista we saw on staff. He seemed a bit overwhelmed as a long line started to develop inside this tiny Starbucks. I really hope he had another coworker there that was on break or something because that would really be tragic if he was the only one on staff for the whole night. 5 stars for that guy, 0 for Starbucks if he was the only one on shift that night"
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2017-07-15,1.0,Never been to such a angry and grumpy Starbucks ! And what Starbucks doesn't have half and half and milk !!
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2015-11-14,4.0,"This is one of the most strategic locations to grab a quick cup of coffee before rushing off to work or school. Its right by the Port Authority, so you can grab the A & C trains and buses to wherever and whenever. Now normally I never review franchise restaurants and coffeeshops, but Starbucks at this point is synonymous with coffee, so why not review my favorite particular location? The servers here are very friendly and helpful, and I've never gotten a wrong coffee order here unlike at a few other locations I've been to in the past. I usually order either the Mocha or the Iced Mocha in a Venti size. Definitely go try this place out for your morning or afternoon coffee :)"
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2018-05-26,3.0,"How does a Starbucks run out of decaf iced coffee? Your a coffee place and you run out of decaf iced coffee? Just strange! When they told me that I they were out, they were annoyed that I changed my drink order and decided to throw my original cup across the back of the store! Uncalled for"
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2017-07-27,3.0,I love coming to this Starbucks for ever and I  have been treated well most of the time. I go in the morning to have my coffee and meet with my neighbors to have our morning coffee clutch but lately it's saddens me that the music is so loud that we can no longer have a conversation. I talked to the district manager who is a very nice lady but it seams her hands are tied. The big wigs want the music loud to keep their employees happy. What about their customers? Shouldn't We Be Happy We are the ones who are spending the money. Don't they like old people coming in their place and having a nice time Why are they discriminanating against Older Folks Shame on them. Some day they will be old too and the loud music will hurt their ears too.  It's a Coffee House Not A Disco !!!
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2013-06-27,5.0,"Shall I be the 5,486th person to review Starbucks?  Yes, today I shall . . . because it's summer and they opened this new location 200 feet from my office.

Summer begins when I walk into Starbucks and order ""Grande Black Ice Tea, unsweetned"".  It will be the first of about 400 before the summer winds down, the humidity backs away and the the late September sun shines bright and chill.  

Today, the guy answered ""I like a girl that knows how to order!"" 

Me too."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2017-05-20,1.0,"All of the guys who work at this location are extremely rude.  You walk in and they act disgusted to see you, yet I only order a tall Pike brewed coffee, so I can about imagine the looks that someone with a complicated handcrafted drink gets.  They also do dumb and lazy stuff like cover the trash can holes on top of the creamers station so they don't need to empty the trash.  Just walked in there the other night (15 minutes before they were supposed to close) and one of the guys rudely screamed ""we're closed!"", as if I should have known they were too lazy to stay open until corporate instructs them to.  Truly a terrible location."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2016-08-20,3.0,"This location takes soooo long and it's all over the place. There was a huge line but my thing is, why not give people their stuff in order? Why does the person in front of me get their stuff 10 minutes after waiting but me 45 minutes when others after me got theirs before me."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2016-06-05,4.0,"The reason this location is one I love visiting, is because they are not as busy as other locations in NYC, and if they do get busy, they know how to speed things up so even if there are 8 people ahead, you can still have your coffee in 10 minutes. Always got the coffee right here. Good Starbucks."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2014-05-08,4.0,"This is a smaller location - but newer.  It's got huge windows with bar seats, and a few seats on a banquette towards the back.  Baristas are friendly, and the overall energy is created by the newer Starbucks look.  Other than that, it's your standard location - without a bathroom - on *42nd* street between 8th and 9th.  Not to be confused with the Starbucks on *43rd* and 9th."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2017-05-19,5.0,"The morning crew is phenomenal! They crunch through an obscene amount of orders with remarkable deftness and pinpoint accuracy, all while keeping spirits up and making the regulars feel special."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2016-11-19,5.0,"Great baristas- very helpful and friendly. Have English breakfast tea, soy milk and stevia sweetener and I'm happy!"
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2014-02-07,3.0,Standard starbucks. I came here late and got a seat at the window. I ordered the Pike and it was fresh. The service was nice as can generally be expected
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2014-12-09,4.0,"The service was great, the place's cozy and warm and with a great view to the street. 

The thing is, I found the tables a little sloppy, and I was NEVER able to connect to the Wi-Fi. That was really terrible.

The service was fast, and I love that they have different types of sugar available!!"
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2016-04-03,1.0,This is the most unorganized Starbucks I've been to.  There's always a line when they don't even do the business that some other locations do...it's organized and slow.   These folks would get crushed if they were anywhere else in midtown
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2015-05-24,5.0,"Excellent service, took care of us when the card was not working for the coupon. Highly recommend this to everyone of they are looking for good coffee and great service"
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2016-02-05,1.0,"First coffee experience in the states was not pleasant. My latte tasted like frothed milk, there was barely a hint of coffee in it at all. Would not recommend visiting if you are used to even moderately good coffee."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2017-05-29,1.0,Extremely slow service. Even when you are the only customer it always takes at least ten to fifteen minutes for a drink. Often prepared incorrectly. Finally done with coming here.
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2016-01-16,1.0,"I come here all the time, but the staff today (1/16/2016) was rude. The barista did not call out the drink orders as they came up. So I had to guess which one was mine. When the barista's eyes caught mine, I said to him, ""Is this my hot chocolate."" He stared directly at me and didn't say anything. I find is very unprofessional for an employee to completely ignore a customer. If I were you I'd go half a block west to the Starbucks on 9th Ave just north of 42nd. They're much more friendly there."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2015-05-15,5.0,"Fast service! Close to Times Square and port authority! Even with the busy location, you'll still get served quickly. Always a must bc we're always on the go!"
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2014-03-25,4.0,"This Starbucks is in a nice location and it's pretty fast.  The people working there are always cordial.  The only downside is that if you need to use the restroom you are out of luck.  This Starbucks has no restroom.  Other than that, it's great.  And in a way it's nice the it doesn't have a restroom because people move in and out of there pretty quickly."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2013-11-25,5.0,I love this Starbucks location because it is conveniently located near port authority and it's always clean. The baristas and cashiers are always polite and courteous. The lines move quickly so you never have to wait more than 5 minutes for your drink. This is my favorite Starbucks in the area. The seats are also facing 42nd street so it's perfect for people watching. Definitely recommend to others
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2014-02-26,4.0,"Got my usual-- whole milk vanilla chai tea latte. Spot on. Quick service, Clean store. Great location in Times Square right off Broadway. Open late. What more could you ask for?"
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2014-01-12,5.0,Starbucks!!!! Lol as I always say a Starbucks is a starbucks what can you really expect? Hopefully you get good service they don't mess up your order (WHICH THEY DONT) and maybe you'll have a seat or place to plug your phone or computer. I favor this one because its never too busy so no long wait and it is on 42nd st so thats a rare commodity! Plus you might even get lucky enough to bump into me! Lol hope to see you there.........
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2014-04-04,5.0,Definitely the nicest Starbucks baristas I've ever gotten drinks from. The mood in there is so different than all the other Starbucks. It seems like every employee in there operates on the same outlook of service. So nice!!!
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2013-05-05,2.0,I walked up 8th ave from PATH 33rd to get to my friend's condo and stopped here for a quick pick me up... ordered a Mocha cause I was feeling something sweet. Lets just say it tasted really dull and kinda smokey/burnt--don't think I've had a Mocha this bad before smh. Anyways... there are plenty of Starbucks locations in the city and although this 'bux is rather convenient... I won't be coming back.
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2015-09-04,5.0,"Starbucks!!!!  Please take these employees here, promote them and have them train the other baristas in the city.  These guys are strong examples of your culture."
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2015-07-15,5.0,The Manager has to be the nicest guy that works at Starbucks!  He greets everyone and his staff does the same when he isn't around.  He is a great leader and hopefully they appreciate how hard he works.  It is a tough area to always be so nice... I live in the building and people can be a little mean sometimes.
1074,starbucks-new-york-253,2014-12-19,1.0,I have been a Starbucks customer for a number of years. I have spent thousands of dollars at various shops. Today I was treated terribly at this location near Port Authority in Manhattan between 9th and 8th Avenues. I went in the store with four coffee beans packages which were given to me as a present from a student. I don't use these coffee beans and asked if I could get the price of the beans added to my gold Starbucks rewards card. After being refused several times by the personnel I was told to call customer service where I was put on hold. I felt extremely angry and threw all the coffee beans and my Starbucks gold rewards card in the shop and left. I don't want to return ever again. This is just a big corporation that does not care about their customers
1075,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-147,2017-12-04,4.0,"3.5 stars. 

Nice service with good food. There are plenty of LPQs in the city and surprisingly this was the first one I have ever went to. It was a pleasant experience. I got the butternut squash and goat cheese frittata that came with a small salad and bread and it was all quite delicious. It was large in portion with plenty of squash and goat cheese in the dish, good for its value. It also came with a small side of creme fraiche. I think the only negative about the dish was that the frittata came out a bit cold. Heated would have been nice."
1075,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-147,2019-05-31,3.0,"Wow, I'm literally underneath the Chrysler building, or at least our classrooms are located there. One of the highlights of Le Pain Quotidien was the beautiful lighting from the window which added to the ambience.  I thought the layout was a bit cozy, but I didn't have many bags or luggage, so I just was taking it in.  I'm not often at a Le Pain Quotidien, except the one in downtown Brooklyn near the Promenade.  I found that this restaurant had decent breakfast.  The place was not packed, and it was about 11 am.  

We walked in confused and soon realized we had to seat ourselves(there's a sign that states this).  I came in with a colleague and was served immediately after placing our order.  I had the dragonfruit smoothie granola bowl which was small and tasty.  My coworker had the salmon lox platter, and it came with plenty of bread.  He said it was amazing, and his only hiccup was that his coffee was taken away before he was done.  The thing is he had stepped away to go to the bathroom, so when he returned he found that disappointing and upsetting.  

Lastly, due to the nature of our working lunch, we were in need of returning back to work by noon sharp, since we have to teach our students, and yet we were surprised to have trouble finding our waitress at this time.  Luckily, there was a lady in charge who was able to find our waitress to help us with the check and wrap things to go.  That really helped.  I didn't get her name, but that really made it a 3 star experience.  Although the meal was delicious, the prices are steep, since it's Midtown Manhattan, so things are in the teens for breakfast combinations.  I recommend it if you want a laid back chill experience."
1075,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-147,2018-12-03,3.0,"This review would be for a smart-n-grab Ritual order. I opted for the Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad, also featuring avocado, bacon, hard-boiled egg, Fourme d'Ambert, tomato, mesclun and smoked tea vinaigrette.

The salad was pretty delicious. While it was a bit heavy on the greens / light on the good stuff, e.g., chicken, eggs, and avocado, it was generally well-composed and tasty - vinaigrette was yum. Would have been a bit more disappointed if I paid full-price ($17) instead of the promotional price ($10)? Yeah, probably."
1075,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-147,2019-07-01,3.0,"I ordered togo, and this location needs some help. The staff is a little rude and I noticed every patron in front of me was complaining of their orders being messed up, or miscommunication. I got a notification that my order was ready and when i got there, it was not but I didn't mind waiting. 
Food: Vegetable Quiche and salad: SO good. I haven't had good quiche in a while so this was refreshing, it was warm and cheesy and the crust was flaky. highly recommend. 
Seating: Interestingly, they have special seating for those who ordered to go but need a place to sit quickly and eat it(pictured) which is really convenient rather than having to find a nice place to sit in the city."
1075,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-147,2019-04-10,4.0,"Visited this location of Le Pain Quotidien for a work meeting. I kept my order simple and went with a fruit cup and an iced tea. The fruit cup was delicious- lots of fresh fruit and nothing canned. I enjoyed it. The iced tea was delicious as well. The others in my party enjoyed their skillet and muffin. It is important to note that this is a local chain in NYC and their menu is not the same in every location. Someone else in my party had originally wanted an omelette, but they are not offered at this location. This was a great place for a work meeting- no loud music, friendly service, and quick service. Would visit again for another work meeting."
1075,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-147,2019-02-26,2.0,Came in here for a coffee as it was close to my hotel.   I remember Le Pain from Manhattan Beach circa 2008 and remembered it being great so I came in.  Either Le Pain has dipped in quality since then or NYC Le Pains are Merdique.   The woman at the counter was nice.   Ordered an Americano.   The product was not great.   I don't drink coffee with cream or sugar but the quality of the beans used and/or quality of how the shot was pulled was so bad I needed to make an exception to be able to choke this drink down.
1075,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-147,2019-11-08,4.0,Come here a lot. Great seating and very convenient. Service is great and they use Toast which is awesome. Shout out to Abhay B for his great service. Wish the muffins were served hot!
1075,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-147,2018-10-16,1.0,So I paid $6 or something crazy like that for a hot drink that tasted like dirty water.  I used to love their lemon ginger tea.  This had no hint of lemon or ginger.  In fact I am not quite sure what I was served!
1075,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-147,2019-03-05,4.0,This have this custard cream donut that is so delicious! I also highly recommend their lemon honey ginger tea. Really laid back environment.
1075,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-147,2019-05-17,2.0,"This is the worst Pain Quotidien I've been in.  Our lazy server took her time...did not ask how we're doing...didn't come and check...took a long time to wave her down.  The waitresses were just standing there talking.  To add insult to injury, the frittata I ordered was bone dry, the egg skillet my sister ordered was bland with only a few pieces of bacons. The bread was dry.

Sigh what a wasted $50 breakfast!!!!!"

1075,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-147,2018-06-12,3.0,"I ordered a Matcha Latte, Salmon and Avocado Toast, and ended it with a mini cheesecake dessert.

Liked: The cheesecake was just perfectly chilled and sweet without giving you a headache. Completely filled me up and was worth paying for. The salmon and avocado was well made. 

Disliked: I've had matcha lattes in the Midwest and in CA and I'm not sure if this is a New York thing or just this places but the drink tasted bitter, watery, and like they forgot to add matcha to begin with. I asked for extra matcha which they were kind enough to do but I'm sad to report it didn't add to the drinks existence. Although the salmon and avocado were delicious it was ruined somewhat by the toast. Yes it is toast and should be crunchy but I was served more burnt bread than toast.

The service...it's hard to explain but we had almost too many waiters/waitresses we didn't know who to ask and the one who was very kind to us originally became so busy we couldn't grab our check for 20 min. While other servers seemed to be huddled around gossiping. I do give props to the aesthetics and clean facilities and when asked questions or changes on the check, we did receive polite responses as should. Overall, okay place."

Frantic unorganized staff. Waited 15 minutes to sit with open tables everywhere.
No one seemed to know which waiters had which tables.
Once sat at our table no one ever waited on us. Waited another 15 minutes with staff and supposed managers passing by our table along one of the main paths.
Complete lack of attention but worse when asked who was in charge of our table all staff were completely non responsive, dismissive and rude.
Unacceptable."

We had breakfast at this place, and it is easily the absolutely worst breakfast that I have had in my life by a large margin. We ordered French baguette, cheese, Belgian waffle, mini pancakes and omelette. The baguette was so old and hard that after eating it my teeth were aching throughout the day, and I had a stomach ache throughout the day as I could not digest their old bread. I should have returned it to the kitchen. The rest of the menu was not any better. I tried the toast that came with the omelette, and it was old and stale as well. pan cakes was the only decent food that we had there. Lesson is when in NYC avoid at all costs chain restaurants with 3 yelp stars. You will regret it."

It has a quaint very French (like, real France) atmosphere, the food is fresh and they give great healthy options for lunch. It's pricey even by nyc standards but you overlook that. And it's a nice sit down option in the midst of an area overcrowded with quick fare options for the zillions of offices in the area.

Unfortunately they never seem to have their act together enough for it to actually be a pleasant experience. They are always out of something - whether it be the wines on their menu or the milk options for coffees. The coffee bar itself is always painfully slow in the mornings -- something that really should just not happen in NYC!!!

If they fixed the above, I'd be here all the time!"

Quinoa walnut salad with panes of gorgonzola cheese is a mouthwatering wonder and paired with a flute of rose made for a filling and fulfilling midday outing."

Had to drive into NYC for my daughter's college interview and came across this cafe. The interior was nice & spacious with a long wooden common table and small tables. There were no lines since it was 9:50am Sunday. We ordered organic mini pancakes with fresh berries and chicken zucchini soup with piece of baguette.

Ibnoy Diallo, the manager working there on Wed March 27 (around 3:30 pm) noticed when I had been seated for a few minutes and looked ready to order and came over himself to chat with me. He welcomed me, asked what he could get for me, and made me feel comfortable by checking on a nut allergy for me when I was hesitant to order the Pavlova (no almonds- and it was delicious!)

Maybe because they more stuff. Anyway I had a plate of chicken salad with toasted bread. One friend had a bowl of soup and another had an avocado salad. Everything we had looked amazing. My chicken salad was freshly made on a crunchy toast, loved it! Of course we finished them all. We don't mess around!  Even the restaurant didn't mess around either; they serve coffee/tea in a giant cup to a tiny me! (Yea, right!) After the food, the desserts followed. A slice of chocolate cake for my friend and a slice of cheesecake for me wouldn't hurt. Try some! Our waitress was nice and pleasant. Good job!"

It took forever to get our coffee and then my steamed almond milk was given to someone else instead.  When the food finally arrived, one of the items was incorrect, but we kept it because the alternative of waiting longer was not so appealing.  We had to ask multiple times for jam and were never given water.  We finally had to flag down the manager for our check.  He responded quickly and gave dessert for our troubles, but unfortunately this was just too little too late.  The only positive was that food was good.

Our server's name was Iaisha and she was incredible. She greeted us and made sure we got everything we ordered promptly and just the way we wanted it - she went above and beyond.

The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because this location was out of a lot if stuff - no more coolers, no prosecco, etc. i found that really odd.

We arrived at about 3:30 p.m. and we stayed for more than two hours, which was made possible by the very generous amount of seating and also the non-mealtime hour.  My friend had already ordered coffee before I arrived and I didn't realize that, so I ordered coffee at the front counter.  It turned out that the guy taking care of my order was the manager and he was SUPER-nice; he was incredibly friendly and personable.

The server who took care of my friend's order was very pleasant - and the interior of this place is very attractive, with an ""open"" feeling and large windows on both sides.  My coffee, however, was very mediocre-tasting and too weak.  However, the price was reasonable ($2.78 with tax for a small size cup).

I seriously ate it, couldn't stop talking about it, went back the next day and ordered it again... Wouldn't stop talking about it still... Then looked up how to make their avocado toast and citrus cumin salt--which ended up being in their website! (Literally lemon zest, cumin, sea salt and red pepper flakes!)

Their AT has their signature citrus cumin salt and chia seeds on there. I don't know what I have been eating all these years, but my hand to Jesus--I still to this day (it's been over 2 weeks) cannot stop talking about that DAMN AVOCADO TOAST. 

I like the bakery feel. Loved that you can get fresh squeezed and seasonal juices! On the two days I went, the first day was their last on summer juices, and I had a watermelon, cucumber cooler and then the next day, I had something fall-themed. Yeah, obviously memorable but you know where my mind was on that 2nd day... 

I rest my case. I dream of the day I can go back and devour another order."

I ordered the Avocado Tartine with salmon  on gluten free toast. So yummy! I think it's the best gluten free bread I've ever had. I also ordered a latte with almond milk which was good.  My server, Aissata, was attentive and polite even though it got pretty busy.

Overall I'm really happy to have discovered another gluten free restaurant that I can include on my list when I travel. Highly recommend to other gluten free sensitive folks!"

1076,starbucks-new-york-505,2019-01-30,4.0,"As far as Starbucks go, this place is pretty awesome if you're doing mobile order! If you're not doing mobile order, not so much. I used to go to another Starbucks location on my way to work, but I decided this one was worth going a little out of my way to try instead.

The real highlight of this Starbucks is its efficiency during the morning rush. I usually place my order about 5 minutes before I plan to be there, and my order is completely ready about 50% of the time. Another 40% of the time I wait just another minute and 10% or so I've had to wait an extra 5 minutes (on super busy days). Despite the wait, there's one staff member always stationed at mobile orders and he provides FANTASTIC service (I wish I remembered his name... I'll have to provide an update next time I visit). He is upbeat, very friendly, and will literally prepare your order personally if you've been waiting more than 5 minutes. Awesome!

Otherwise, this Starbucks is ""above average"". It's small, but so is every other Starbucks in Manhattan. The ceiling is absolutely gorgeous, though! And food and drink orders are *usually* correct (there have been a few times I've had to ask for them to fix my drink, but it doesn't happen often).

Overall, a solid 4-star Starbucks in midtown east."

1076,starbucks-new-york-505,2016-12-21,5.0,"I come to this Starbucks location all the time because it is right next to my office building. The staff is always very friendly and upbeat, so it's hard to be in a bad mood, even with the morning crowded rush. They get orders right, and if it's not, they fix immediately. Great customer service, like every Starbucks should be. I always use my Starbucks mobile app to pay, and the process is great and easy. Mobile ordering from the app also works really well here, and they always get your order done very quickly, in the lower end of the estimated time range displayed. 

Side note: this Starbucks is connected to the Lexington hotel, and if you go through the back door, it'll lead you straight to the lobby of the hotel, where you can enjoy your coffee in a chic, festive, and cozy environment."

When you walk in from the street, you're greeted by a veritable blockade of people waiting at the end of the bar for their drinks.  Once you wade your way through that, you have the serpentine line of people waiting to order, and then the cashier.  

Coming through the Lexington Hotel is almost worse, as you're pushed into the middle of a line and have to negotiate your way to the end. The space is very small for the number of people working--and at times it's seemed like there were too many cooks in the kitchen because they were visibly frustrated at getting in each others way. 

My coffees are usually fine, but there are definite consistency problems--sometimes I get the requested milk and sugar in the coffee, sometimes I don't.  I never get service with a smile, but I can't entirely blame that on the baristas that are CLEARLY overwhelmed."

1076,starbucks-new-york-505,2015-05-15,3.0,"Its a Starbucks, a chain focused on supplying magical caffeine conveniently every four blocks. This one is smaller than average, and located in the Lexington hotel with a tiny little sign that shows you where to enter from the street. The store is very very narrow with doors at either end (to the street or to the hotel). The line meets at the cashier at the end closer to the hotel door. This means if you're entering from the hotel side and there is already a long line, you're going to have a lot of trouble navigating to the back of the line because the space is so small. 

The baristas are quick and on top of things, even though the back prep area is really tight. I haven't had problems with my drink and rarely have had to wait more than a few minutes.

There is NO SEATING in this Sbux. But PRO TIP: Enter the hotel from the back door and go up the stairs to your left. you'll emerge on the hotel mezzanine level where there are seats, couches, and little cocktail tables. No wifi that I'm aware of, but definitely helpful if you must get away for a secret meet up."

The building's columns also make for a bad flow/feng shui."
1076,starbucks-new-york-505,2011-06-10,4.0,"While I am not a fan of Starbucks coffee, I somehow managed to become a Gold Card member since 2010. For a coffee snob to frequent a place that is deemed to offer coffee of average quality, there needs to be other factors other than convenience. 

Starbucks @511 Lexington has become a third or fourth home due to the wonderful staff that prepares my drink. The baristas are friendly and proficient at managing down long lines with ease as this location services hotel customers along with patrons working in the Midtown East area. The baristas would also provide the hookup with an occassional specialty drink for a price of a regular grande house blend.

When they aren't busy, the staff is on-point and it's in and out. When they're busy, drinks back up, the work space seems too small for the number of workers trying to move around each other, service is kind of impersonal, the waiting area gets mixed with the line and the wait time can be annoying. 

On a side note, some of the pictures are misleading because there isn't any seating at this location."

1076,starbucks-new-york-505,2014-09-25,1.0,"The workers at this Starbucks make me want to shoot myself in the face. I only ever order plain hot coffees, and at your typical Starbucks, by the time you pay and get your receipt, the coffee is about 5 seconds from being in your hand. At this Starbucks, they always have a bunch of people who are supposed to be filling the drink orders and 2 cashiers, yet, whenever I order a plain coffee I have to wait around for at least a minute or two.

You may think, no big deal right? Well Starbucks also has this rule where if you get a plain coffee, you can't pick up at the drink counter--you MUST wait at the cashier line. And let me tell you, this Starbucks is the size of a large closet. They've laid out the store poorly on top of that so when the cashier and the drink makers are not coordinated, what happens at morning rush hour here is that there are a bunch of people rushing to work all bottlenecked at the tiny space around the cash register awkwardly waiting for plain coffees.

Now add in the additional factor that the cash register people are always chatting about their paychecks and not paying attention. When I come here, about 1/3 of the time I have to remind the person who took my order to actually call to the drink maker in the back to pour a venti bold. Seriously? YOU HAVE ONE JOB.

Then I get a sloppy $2.67 coffee. It's always either too little coffee in the cup or too much, or the outside of the cup is browned from someone spilling in the back. And of course, we can't forget all of the delightful (read slow) tourists that are staying in the hotel joined to this starbucks which just really is the cherry on top.

If my usual starbucks on 51st between Lex and Park weren't blocked off because of the UN conferences right now, I would never entertain the idea of coming here for coffee even if it's right there. Get yourselves together, people."

At 8 am they were already out of turkey bacon which I ended up having them replace with ham.  Service was good and they were nice about the lack of turkey bacon.  It's a Starbucks if you have been to one before you know what they have to offer.  There is no place to sit down in this one, so I would only go here if you are looking to dip in and out real quick.

Not to mention I get charged a different price every time I go (anywhere from 7-9 dollars for a small roll). I have included a picture of the sad, cold sandwich (weird grey chicken, unmelted cheese... you get the point)."

This time they gave me a cheeseburger when I asked for a vegetarian sandwich. I specified NO MEAT. Instead this is what I got. I'm done. Don't go here. It's disgusting. And it took over 10 minutes for them to make this pathetic excuse for a sandwich. asked for a feta, cucumber and tomato sandwich, which is an item on their menu. Instead they gave me this disgusting meat thing that they charged almost $8 for. I thought this was New York. What a disgrace. I want my money back."

1077,blue-and-gold-deli-new-york-2,2018-01-31,3.0,Found this place through mealpal and they are very generous with their portions. I tried their roast beef with cheddar lettuce tomato on a hero today and it was pretty okay. The roast beef and the bread itself was a tad bit too dry for my preference but the staff was really friendly and the food was ready by the time i got there. I am used to having double dipped gravy with my roast beef and this tends to be a more cold cut type of sandwich. It was still really good and I managed to finish the whole 10'' hero after walking the 20 blocks to pick it up!
1077,blue-and-gold-deli-new-york-2,2018-06-14,1.0,It's trash and dirty .half a star ...the dude was talking over my sandwich while watching a video on his phone and the hot food is not at the right temperature. They must be paying the food inspector to pass them . It's either burnt or over cooked food but it is a poor mans deli so all is good if you can't afford whole food sandwich

1077,blue-and-gold-deli-new-york-2,2014-05-19,2.0,"My primary beef is with their terrible coffee. It tastes insultingly bad, at every hour of the day and every month of the year. Only thing worse than a hot cup is an iced cup. Further, they are charging $.50-1.50 more than every coffee cart or bodega in midtown. 

The saving grace of Blue & Gold is their daily prepared foods. I'm not saying anyone outside the neighborhood should seek it out, but for what it is, it's pretty tasty. It is most certainly overpriced but as someone else mentioned, they are without competition for a few blocks. 

All in all, I wanted to love this place as my local shop but they seem to have no interest in breeding loyalty. If literally any other sandwich shop opened within two blocks, I'd have been an improvement."

It is family owned and all the workers there really go out of your way to make you feel like family. They get orders done in a New York minute and it's always done precisely how I order it. I am a picky eater but they always get my order right without a doubt! There's nothing like a fresh turkey sandwich from this store. I would highly recommend it!!!

1077,blue-and-gold-deli-new-york-2,2011-03-08,5.0,"I love Blue & Gold. To the untrained eye, it's merely another NY deli. 

I work around the block on 2nd Avenue, and often pop into Blue & Gold for some of their amazing iced coffee -- there's just something different about their brew than the kind you can grab on the street (still quite good), or at an over-priced Starbucks -- or sometimes even a bagel or fruit for breakfast. 

The guys who work there are very friendly, and at one point I was going so frequently that they knew my coffee order by-heart. 

It's conveniently in terms of location for me - steps from my office, my subway stop, and my nail salon. 

In addition to their bagels, fruit, and coffee, lunch at Blue & Gold is pretty good, too. I've had their falafel pita before, as well as mixed vegetables and rice, and it's quite inexpensive, and very filling. 

Great selection of sodas, too.

They accept credit cards, but also have an ATM, which is helpful when I need to get cash to tip at the nail salon next door."

I was ok with this location up until this point. Then I was handed my grande pike roast, when I grabbed the half and half pitcher it had all spoiled half and half (think cream cheese or ricotta) all over the spout. It was pretty nasty. I asked the barista for some fresh half and half which he handed me without issue. Then behind me I noticed someone using the nasty pitcher before I could stop him. For me this is a clear lack of quality control and easily fixable."

We literally waited on  the line for at least 15 minutes with no one behind the register, however there were 2 staff members next to it... just stocking pastries even though the pastry case already looked pretty full from the outside.

So, like, I don't speak the ""Fratalian"" required to effortlessly order drinks for others, so I was also a bit intimidated. It was 8:30 am and no one has had their morning jolt of caffeine, so I knew I HAD to get this right or risk enduring a 2 hr ride under hostile conditions. LOL. Barista Alex was helpful and very patient with me and chuckled when my first words were "" Don't be fooled by what you see because I'M STILL ASLEEP.""
He helped me make sense of the nonsensical words  which were coming out of my mouth, [Like wth is a 1/2 ""caff"" venti black eye anyway?] and placed my orders without sighs of exasperation. 
Thank heavens the orders were correct [Thanks Alex] and my cranky car mate got his morning fix of caffeine so I could ride in peace.

Its in a great location and gets good foot traffic, so it was quite busy. However, I got in and out relatively quickly.
The staff was awesome and you can tell they like what they do.

When I walked in and ready to order my drink, the girl behind the counter wasn't show any welcome. I ordered cold brew and she told me that they are out of cold brew! It was 11:30am and they are out of cold brew? Hard to believe. Then I asked for ""coconut milk"" matcha latte. She made it almond milk! I told her that I asked for ""coconut milk"" she said to me ""you said almond milk!!"" Instead of making a new one without any drama. 

Then she dumped my almond milk latte, and washed my cup and use the same cup for my new drink. That was weird too. But I didn't say anything and left after writing this review."

This Starbucks is one of the smaller ones I have been to, and did not have a lot of tables and seats. Took a while for my friend to get his drink, while I charged my laptop at a table I barely managed to swoop before someone else took it. These things are pretty typical of any Starbucks though."

Really, though, I love the staff here, but the location could *really* use the remodel.  I hope they get it soon.  This specific location has a good amount of seating compared to others nearby, though, which is nice.  

If you aren't familiar with a ""dirty"" chai, give it a try, especially if you enjoy a Starbucks Chai latte, but want a little more caffeine.  The ""dirty"" part of it is literally an espresso shot.  Get it with your favorite milk (soy, whole, skim etc)."

I spoke to the district manager who is a sweetheart but her hands are tied it seams the big wigs want the music loud to entertain their employees and keep them happy.
Well excuse me but how about keeping your customers happy and not bleed our ears. We are the ones that come in here every morning and spend a lot of money. This is a Coffeehouse Not A Disco !!! 
WISE UP !!!"

The guy behind the counter is screaming along loudly, with dumb lyrics like ""The things I want to do to your body, I want to rip your clothes off."" Nice. Not really what I want to be assaulted with in the morning. I just want a quiet cup of coffee?  Is that too much to ask at a coffee shop?!

Meanwhile, the shelf with the milk, sugar, and other items is a completely disgusting disaster. Seriously looks like a 1st grade class just came through. Out of everything.

I'm not sure this place is even safe to eat or drink at. Very dirty, and chronically understaffed.

This reminded of why I only go into this location about once every six months, even though I live really close by.

1088,starbucks-new-york-331,2017-08-01,1.0,"The franchisee / operator of this particular Starbuck location is appalling with cringe-worthy conditions. 

For starters, disgusting sanitary conditions with flies on food, sticky floor and table, urine and other human waste on the bathroom floor, a huge mess on the creamer and napkin counter, and cockroaches on the floor near the shelf with pastries and food items. 

The manager/operator, who is a built Caucasian male in this 40/50's ish wearing boots most of the time, of this place is clearly very discriminatory as well - if you're Caucasian, you get warm greetings and customer services whereas; if you are a racial minority, you get a stern look and very curt, arrogant, and annoyed ""service"", if you can call it service at all. 

Particularly troubling and problematic: There were several times that the operator/manager, who doesn't wear a Starbucks apron but walk in and out of the backend kitchen all the time, who is either a manager or the owner/operator/franchisee, have asked ethnic patrons to stand up and make room for Caucasian patrons saying ""you'been here too long..."" etc. 

This is just unacceptable. Starbucks corporate should look into the situation and review this particular franchisee.

Until then, avoid this location at all costs; run away - unless you prefer a diarrhea, some fecal matter on your shoes, or being asked to ""make room"" for Caucasian patrons."

I do think that their coffee must be good if everyone keeps coming back for their overpriced coffee (in whichever size you are looking to consume).

Because the products sold at Starbucks are basically done the same way across the chain, I can only base my review on the location and the vibe. The few times I have been here is because someone else is looking for a coffee. I will say that while the staff is pretty nice, they have a little careless edge about them. Almost every time I have been here if not every time, I see bottles or paper on their table. So the place could be kept a bit tidier.

The line in the front is somewhat inconvenient as it basically starts right at the door entry, so if you need to get your coffee you need to go through the line to exit or find a chair at the tables to sit down.

I think this place just needs a little bit of investment on the decor and some reorganizing of the small space."

Seriously EVERY single drink I've received in the last month has been only filled half way to a third and the rest is all foam.  I constantly have to ask the barista to remove all the foam and put more milk in it.  Also, if I'm paying for a grande, don't give me a tall and fill the cup with foam.  Today my friend picked it up for me and I warned her about the foam, and sure enough she had to give it back to the barista to fill up.  Even after that, when I took the lid off, it was only filled up 3/4 of the way.  I took a pic bc it still shocks me.

Excuses instead of service

When I arrived here at 8 PM Tuesday night and attempted to place my order, I was met with excuses right away.

""Can I have a large frozen hot chocolate?""
Cashier: Our machine doesn't work.

""Can I have the 2 for 5 Bacon Egg & Cheese on a croissant?""
Second Cashier: Our oven is turned off.

""Why is your oven turned off?"" 
Cashier: We're closed.

If you're closed, you need to:
1) Lock the door 
2) clear out existing customers or solicitors (three were at the window in a drunken haze, likely street hustlers).

Don't come here late nights. Other than the Tuckahoe Rd location, I've never dealt with such stubborn personnel. I do hope someone has a better experience than this."

Mind you I order this almost every morning when going to school from different Dunkin locations all over manhattan and queens. 

I was so shocked and disgusted by the workers at this establishment. They are convinced that they are correct, so either the management is completely training their employees incorrectly or this joint is honestly just trying to rip people off. 

I asked for a refund and they refused until I forced them too. They told me to leave and never return. Absolutely barbaric and incompetent service. I may never return to a Dunkin' Donuts after this experience!"
1093,dunkin-new-york-90,2019-09-27,1.0,Waited at the register for 5 minutes for someone to put in a coffee order and no one even looked up to come over. They also look like they're on their last light bulb. It is so dark in there. This location used to be good - clean and excellent service - but management must have changed.
1093,dunkin-new-york-90,2018-08-21,1.0,"Sorry Dunkin' this location on 34th Street is terrible. I ordered the new ham and cheese roll up snack and was given 1 roll up. I explained they are 2 to an order. The employees argued that I was wrong. I showed them the Corp Dunkin News that clearly advertises 2 per order. The manager still told me I was wrong. Know your brand and do better 34th Street

Donuts were fine and so were the bagels. Also ordered an iced coffee at one point and it was good. Staff are okay, but could be a little friendlier and more helpful. I don't remember having the same problems as some of the other Yelpers pointed out. Honestly, it's really no different from the other Dunkin' Donuts locations, which are found all over New York City."

I like their croissant&egg&cheese as well as the plain croissant. Mutlu-grain bagel not as good as Starbucks but okay. Donuts are fresh, Boston Creme always the favorite. I also tried the blueberry muffin, would recommend. Between the Park and 3rd Avenue and close to subway station so not much to complain about."

The service here is horrible and slow.  Not only that, no one understands basic English.  Now I know we live in a city where English is the least spoken language, but come on -- how hard is ""small"" and ""coffee"".  

Also, to the sandwich maker guy in the back, just a little hint:  When you press clear on the screen yet haven't presented the customer with their order, of course you're going to get confused.  I stood there for an exceptionally long time, watched him clear my order, then ask me a million times what I ordered because he couldn't see it on the screen.  Then he took my item out of someone elses bag.  When I left I heard the person behind me complain because an item was missing (I guess we ordered the same thing).  Never again will I waste my time here in the morning."

Because it's a kosher store, which is fine, they do not have the flatbread egg sandwiches. Don't get me wrong, they make plenty of egg and cheese sandwiches, but they do not have a supply of this type of sandwich, even to sell without meat. So I chose an English muffin with egg whites, no cheese, and a medium coffee.

The women at the counter were some of the rudest I've ever encountered. I repeated ""no cheese"" so many times because she was talking to her coworker and not paying attention to how she entered the order, which meant that when I got my sandwich it had cheese on it. Not ""oooh cheese!"" but gross, neon orange cheese. Ew. The guy who handed it to me, also rude... As in he shoved the bag at me when it was ready.

I got a rubbery piece of ""egg white"" and a warmed, not toasted, English muffin. And it was more expensive than the same meal at the G&G across the street. So unless I need a donut, I'm not coming back here."

1093,dunkin-new-york-90,2011-01-25,2.0,"I love Dunkin' Donuts, but this place really needs to improve, even with their new management (according to the reviewer below).

INCONSISTENT COFFEE MAKING is what really makes this place unreliable for what should be a usually great cup of Dunkin' Donuts coffee. First time I came they made it just right when I said ""cream and sugar please."" Second time I needed to tweak it on my own. Third time it was totally off. I can only imagine how those who are running to late to work feel when that happens. I've been to some DDs that make it right, every time. Not to mention the guy making my coffee was some teenager(?) on the phone with a buddy moving at the speed of a snail, chuckling at some inside joke, and mumbling (perhaps another language), and barely looking at me nor saying a word to me. What's up with that? People behind me in line were pretty furious since everyone's in a hurry, and a lady straight up asked the entire room ""Does anybody else work here because the guy behind the counter is on the phone with his friend."" So, some of the staff are unprofessional according to business standards, but maybe I'm expecting too much from NYC, known to have a million DDs around, and thus not every one of them would be perfect? I guess if I were unhappy with this one, I'll just have to look for another one a few blocks away. 

Overall, when they make it right, it's wonderful. When they don't, it's irksome. You just never know what you're gonna get at this location. And probably other locations too :-/"

I love that the baristas are pretty flexible and will rearrange the recipes to whatever you like. I usually get the power shake without bananas and include raspberries. I've seen some people get granola in their shakes tooThe possibilities are endless with what you can order here. I have yet to try their food here but I'm here almost every other day and will definitely get around to it. 

The only reason I'm docking a star from this place is because I don't understand how a juice/smoothie place only has two blenders and one juicer. This is why it takes so long for orders to come out. I usually have to wait 10 minutes for a small juice. 

The juice is always delicious though and made with care so I guess it's worth the wait!"

Both times were inconsistent as first time I got it they gave me an apple slices along with it and the pepper tasted stronger. But I went again the next day to get the same shot and it felt weaker and also with no apple slices. Regardless - their turmeric shot was really good! Easy to consume. However be careful the tumeric shot might stain your finger and lips yellow. I didn't realize until a friend pointed it out!
1106,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-35,2018-03-24,5.0,"Came here on the first Saturday which it opened. The decor in the space is really cute and seems like it'd be a nice place for conservation. 

I ordered the Joe's Cobb Sandwich and it tasted much better that I thought it would. It was about $9 which is standard for Manhattan. I thought it was quite big and it was in between two slices of crispy flat bread. 

I didn't try any of the smoothies but ordered a coffee. Not bad for coffee but I don't think that is really their sell so will update when I've tried the juice.

The staff was really nice and I think I would return again for sure."
1106,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-35,2019-07-12,1.0,"Sullen, entitled ""baristas"" who insult their customers. I had the nerve to not leave a tip on my $9 juice. Despite being literally the only customer at the counter ordering and waiting, when the juice was prepared he loudly called out ""Richard?"" to my face when it was ready, which was not the name I left when I ordered. So, essentially I was called a dic$ for not leaving a tip. 

Fairly clever of him. But won't be wasting any more money here."

By now they even know my name and give me a big greeting when I come to the counter.  Everything I have tried so far has been delicious especially the sandwiches.  Its good to know that their products are clean and healthy.  I even dropped a few pounds :) I enjoy this place so much, I just signed up for a loyalty card.  
Just one suggestion, I would love to see a rewards app for your phone instead of a card."

Their ""cold brew"" has none of the smoothness nor flavor of an actual cold brew, it instead comes out of what looks to be a hot coffee dispenser and they pour it over ice. What you get is a sour, overly watered down cup of something resembling coffee."

The workers were friendly and efficient. My latte came out pretty fast and I easily found a seat where I could get some work done.

My one issue was the cleanliness. A lot of the tables had wrappers/trash on them and could have used a good cleaning. With all the people in and out, they should be keeping an eye on the tables to see if they need to be tidied up. Otherwise, it is a nice Starbucks!"
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2019-03-05,5.0,"This location is one of the bigger ones. Plenty of seating. There is one large table and some counter seating right as you walk in. 
The ordering counter is beyond the initial seating. Also some seating to the left of the pick up area. 
Service is really good here. Nice, efficient and fast. Feel like they are used to dealing with big lines which is nice if the store is busy. I've always been able to find a seat there. There are bathrooms here too. 
It's a full service like most Starbucks."

This location in particular has a good amount of seating.  But it's just so dirty.  The floors look sticky, the chairs are out of place, the tables aren't wiped, the coffee bar looks like a mess, etc.  It's just not a relaxing location...

The employees didn't seem to be working much.  They were just chatting away... at least they took my order and I was well on my way out. 

I'm not sure why the pumpkin latte I ordered was disgusting.  Lol.  I should have stuck to my regular latte.
The pumpkin bread was also too buttery.
Anyway, Starbucks didn't satisfy today ... but I always give it another chance ."

1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2019-08-27,1.0,"I never review Starbucks but the staff at this location deserve special attention. I approached the counter and three staff members - all young men - were dancing around and having a good time. I waited alone patiently to be served and these three staff members looked at me and continued to dance around and ignore me, even though they could see me waiting. 
Then their supervisor, who was standing by the counter drinking a coffee, told them to serve me.
One of the guys begrudgingly served me.
By this point I was a little angry. It wasn't that I had waited but more that they had all made eye contact and chosen to willfully ignore me. 
I said to the server that I was a little upset to be ignored and he didn't respond verbally at all. Instead he served my coffee with attitude. Typical American behavior. Instead of apologizing he was pissed off at me. Probably because he got told off by his supervisor. 
I challenged him. ""Oh that's it? You're not going to verbally respond to me?"" At that point he ignored me and talked with a big smile to the woman behind me. Ultimately ignoring me and minimizing me. 
Everywhere you go in America, you are reminded that you don't matter and if you have any complaints be ready to experience aggressive behavior and to be gaslighted. 
I walked out of Starbucks paranoid that this dude had spat in my coffee. 
I was furious for all of two minutes. 
Then I let it go.
Because this kind of horrible customer service is everyday in New York. 
You simply don't matter here. That's the reality. Even getting a cup of coffee is an opportunity for someone to remind you of that. Thank you Starbucks for reminding me of how little I matter and how little your staff cares. Why should they? It's only coffee right? 
And it's good training to be an American.
The less you care for others the more American you are."

Anyway, the times I have come here it's been okay, just about a usual Starbucks experience.  I was there Saturday to get a piece of lemon pound cake, I just had a craving.  It was good, the service was friendly, so I can't complain."
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2019-07-11,5.0,"I'm impressed. I usually am dead set against chains, but being able to do a mobile order om the train on my way from Brooklyn to Shetler Studio is a life-saver. This evening I ordered my usual but ended up walking from the Times Square area, took forever. I got there, no order. I was so ready for an argument or battle or something and instead they said they made it, pitched it because it was getting warm and gross, and dropped everything to make me a new one. It was the same kind of service I expect from a mom and pop place that knows me. 
Also I observed a new person being trained and I noticed the woman training her was being exacting but also encouraging and kind. Even though there was training going on, they were adequately staffed to provide quick and efficient service, keeping the line moving. I will definitely feel better about making an exception to my no-chain rule and patronizing Starbucks, especially this one, in the future. I will also contact customer service because everyone on the shift deserves credit and I want to make sure they get it."
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2019-05-10,1.0,"Be prepared to wait at least 15 min after ordering. Even if there is no line.
Not sure why this Starbucks is so slow. There are always around 5 people working and 15-20 people waiting. 
You're better off going to Pret next door.
They are fast and friendly. In and out in usually 5 min at the most."
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2017-07-05,5.0,"OMG I need this for jump starting my day. When Franks in NYC he's around the corner from this oasis of hot blackness touching my lips. Yes, I'm getting coffee daily but without it my morning just doesn't get rolling without it. The Starbucks on West 54th across from the Ed Sullivan theater where David Letterman filmed fills my mug daily to the rim when I'm in town. 

This is a larger sized starbucks where you can hang out , relax and use the wifi while taking a break. You'll find nothing different at this Starbucks except your in walking distance to the NYC's theater district, Central Park and the residence of President of The United States of America Donald J Trump at TRUMP TOWER. Maybe if you get lucky he may have a cup of joe with you. 

You may want one of those sugary drinks, but stick with the fundamentals and have a cub of blackness with cream & sugar. It may not be the best but it's consistent. Enjoy and get your day moving."
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2017-12-04,1.0,"I always liked this Starbucks because it has a fair amount of seating and is in a convenient location, but either Starbucks has a ridiculous new water policy or it's just the way this location is managed. I went up to ask for a cup of water to take medicine because we forgot to order it when we got coffee and a snack.  One friendly staff member said it would be no problem, until another guy stepped in and was like, ""No, actually you need to order that at the register.""

I must have had a confused or incredulous look on my face, because he then added that otherwise they lose money on the cup.  A multi-billion-dollar corporation that is so worried about losing money on a single cup that they would make you wait in a long line for a cup of water? Pass. I thought he was joking at first, but he was completely serious and then I later heard him lecturing the other woman about water.

Have never had this happen at any other Starbucks before, so either it's a new policy or this location is just unreasonable or unaccommodating. Don't see a return visit in the future, since denying customers the basic courtesy of a cup of tap water is one of my biggest pet peeves, especially if you've already ordered other things and contributed to the bottom line."

It's Starbucks.

It's clean. (A from the Health Department.)

It's nicely decorated.

The staff is friendly and accommodating.

The Pike was very good - especially since it's almost 6 pm. Some locations have great coffee in the AM but just so-so in the PM.

Plenty of workspace."
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2018-06-19,2.0,"This is typical of a big city Starbucks, big, busy and somewhat tattered and dirty from all the traffic. The area where I am staying has a shortage of breakfast places so I stopped in here for a cappuccino and English muffin sandwich. I was not impressed! The cappuccino had far too much milk and the breakfast sandwich was a microwaved mess.  Needless to say I will be selecting a new breakfast place tomorrow."
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2017-12-10,2.0,"Honestly, most Starbucks I go to are fine and would be 3 stars, but I have to downgrade this one specifically because of the rudeness of one employee and the apparent cleanliness issues at this location.

First things first, the woman who took my order was perfectly nice, and she's the only reason this review isn't a 1 star. There were no problems there, and my order was fulfilled just fine. However, even after buying a drink and a snack we forgot to get a cup of water for my wife. She went up to the woman who helped me to ask for one, and she was about to get it when one of the guys that worked told her no because ""they would lose money on the cup"". Are you serious? A multi-billion dollar company with average store sales of over a million dollars per is worried about the cost of a single plastic cup? After not getting her cup of water, my wife even overheard the male employee chastising the female employee for agreeing to get us a cup of water.

I have never, in any other Starbucks I've ever been to, seen this type of behavior behind the counter. From refusing a cup of water to openly chastising a fellow coworker, this Starbucks doesn't deserve my or my wife's business, and it really doesn't deserve anyone else's. Just go a block or two in any direction and patronize one of the million other Starbucks in Manhattan.

To top it all off, I noticed that the pour-over machine was filthy. Old coffee grounds looked like they were stuck to the device, and it definitely didn't look like it was properly cleaned from the last usage. Thankfully I didn't get a pour over coffee as those tend to be my go-to choices at other coffee shops. Simply disgusting."
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2015-07-10,4.0,"The Starbucks that was, well, let's just say it needed an update. With the move from across the street, the small space that was - is no more. 

With a much larger, more modern space, this Starbucks definitely got an upgrade. No longer is there a line that fills up the entire space. There is plenty of seating - yes, even bathrooms - and the same friendly baristas that gave the location it's welcoming feel. 

Welcome to 2015: Starbucks 54th and Broadway."
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2017-09-21,5.0,"There is a lot to be said from one block to another. We walked into the Starbucks and inquired about ICE and their store policy? Funny thing was, there was no store policy. Their policy is to satisfy the customer. Heather ordered her usual Trenta no ice green tea lemonade and that is exactly what she got. We were greeted by a young lady named Sam. She was excellent and really cared about our concerns. Good work and this is how you take care of the customer."

It is only about past 1;30 PM and how come their ham salami is not available instead i was offered to get any from their breakfast sandwich selection. Come on- I want my salami  not any of your breakfast food. Anyway, swayed to what is available and it was served quickly to me. I like  the  hanging decoration above the registers. It was disappointing to know  that there is a code to use the bathroom. Not sure though if they'll give it to you if you did not amke any purchase."
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2017-04-08,3.0,It a clean Starbucks with plenty of seats. But it is still quite crowded because it seems that most people are waiting for their broadway shows. The location is great since it's just across the street of the theaters.
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2017-09-24,2.0,"Its coffee served with a side stuck-up servers, who still want a tip for pouring coffee. 

These dumbass kids cant figure out how to non patrons out of the bathrooms, so they lock one of the restrooms so it stays clean. 

Jerks."

1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2017-03-29,1.0,"We stopped in here because it was conveniently across the street from Stephen Colbert late show. They have a public restroom and when I went in to use it it was out of toilet paper. I told an employee and she said ok, I'll take care of it- but she never came back. Six hours later after the show we stopped here for a water and to use the restroom again- STILL NO TP!   I went to the registers to let them know it had been 6 hours and he said - we've been busy. Really?  Ridiculous."
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2017-10-08,1.0,"Honestly the rudest Starbucks I have been to. The staff got an attitude with customers, messed up a lot of orders, and even yelled at a patron to come to them while they were waiting for their coffee at the bar instead of handing it across the bar to them. There seems to be a culture issue at this particular Starbucks."
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2016-04-14,5.0,Good stuff. Busy but never had a problem here so five stars until otherwise wise. Lol
1111,starbucks-new-york-448,2015-11-22,3.0,"It is a Starbucks, what is to review?  I will add that unlike other Starbucks the bathrooms here are locked, you have to ask staff for the code.  Seating was ok, the turnover for seats seems fair.  We stopped here to get a drink, use the bathroom and kill time before going to the Late Show which is directly across the street.  On nicer weather days, there's outdoor seating. On the positive staff were very friendly and fast.  It was staffed well."

1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2018-12-23,4.0,"McDonald's is McDonald's but what made this location stand out from the millions of other McDonald's is that this place is clean as hell! Its located near Columbus Circle and the foot traffic in the area is high.

With that, my double cheeseburger minus the pickles was hot and wasn't cold from laying in their window forever and I was in and out. Isn't that the concept of fast food anyway?"
1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2019-07-31,5.0,"This is McDonald's and you have to lower your expectations on the service. The employees are being replaced by menu screens and I'm sure they aren't killing it in the compensation negotiations.

With that said, 90% of the time they get my food right and in a timely manner.

The food however, is amazing.

When you go to McDonald's, you get to have my all-time favorite burger, the Fresh Meat Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese. It starts off with a sesame seed bun (delivered fresh daily); it's toasted and dressed with their house made ketchup and mustard. They use an all-beef succulent juicy patty that's cooked on a flat-top grill which gives the perfectly mixed lean/fat burger a nice sear. You get TWO, of these delicious bad boys. It's paired with melted American cheese which is a perfect succulent and complementary piece which helps the bun soak up the saltiness of the meat. The burger absolutely melts in your mouth with each bite, but my favorite thing about the meal is that you get to pair it with the famous classic long stringed soft fries. At the peak of enjoyment, when your taste buds can't take it anymore, feel free to wash it all down with a nice ice cold coke."

1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2017-07-18,2.0,"This McDonald's is relatively new/modern by McDonald's standards. Beyond that, you should probably avoid it because...

1. It is ridiculously crowded. Once you order you will spend 10 minutes waiting on food, during which time you will struggle not to be stepped on or knocked down by other patrons.
2. Service is rude. I encountered rude service here. To use the word ""abrupt"" would be too generous. They have more business than they want. Unless you are on your last 1.15 and need a dollar drink, you should skip this."

1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2018-01-16,3.0,"Mcdonald is located on the corner of 56th and eighth Avenue. Right in the heart of crazy town. My buddy lives on 57th St. after a long night of been out partying we were looking for something that was still open at 2 AM the closest place was across the street at McDonald's. 

The store looked modern and very clean inside. 
Granted it is 2 AM in the morning we ordered 4 big Macs 2 quarter pounder's 5 dollar cheeseburgers 3 Egg McMuffin's 3 mcgriddles and 4 orders of fries and 4 snack wraps. It was almost $100 I think. 

The Single cheeseburgers did not taste very good. It tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. The quarter pounder tasted good and the big Macs taste good. I only had a couple of fries but I could tell that they made the fries fresh. The best where the snack wraps the chicken was crispy and juicy and they were about as good as snack wraps can get from a fast food place. 

Overall this is in a great location if you can bear all the craziness. Tourists central. There was a Wendy's right next-door but they were closed. My buddy said that this McDonald's even delivers but he lives across the street. When we're hanging out I'll deathly come back to this McDonald's"
1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2015-08-07,2.0,"Dirty tables. Don't know where to put my handbag. They literally threw the burgers into the paper bags. The ranch they gave me was partially opened. I asked the cleaning person to wipe the table, he did a haphazard job, one sweep. Didn't do much. 

Is there a manager here who at least know what barn he's running here???"
1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2019-07-20,1.0,"Most disgusting McDonald's restaurant I have even set foot in. Zero customer service, bathrooms are in a disgusting condition and the inside eating area is extremely"
1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2016-08-12,4.0,"Came in again tonight to order from their new Breakfast All Day menu. As I've already mentioned countless times in previous reviews, I'm a breakfast guy. I could have it any time of the day if I could. Unfortunately, I'm also a late riser so I often miss the morning breakfast time window that most places adhere to. So McDonald's new all day breakfast policy has been a godsend for my sensibilities!!

I had the Egg McMuffin with Canadian Bacon & cheese, a hash brown and an Iced Coffee. As Egg McMuffins go, this one is much less greasy than most egg & cheese sandwiches, and lighter than the Sausage McMuffin. The hash brown had a nice, golden crisp to it, and the Iced Coffee was very refreshing."
1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2018-05-27,1.0,This is the worst McDonald's. Let me say everything is overpriced. Do not go here. You will get a better meal somewhere else at the same price but better quality. The manager was arguing with an Uber eats guy ( hilarious and unprofessional). Why I will not come back? 5.99 for a ten piece and 2.79 for a side salad that literally was reduced to no salad. Terrible experience.

1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2018-07-22,1.0,"One of the worst McDonald's I've ever been. When I asked the manager if I could get a special order, she irritatedly said she cannot.

1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2018-03-12,1.0,"I grew up nearby and it is fascinating to me how this McDonald's still exists. This McD was and is the worst. Anybody that knows anything would avoid this place and go to McD in Rockeller Center, or Hell's Kitchen or uptown. They are at a PRIME location where Yelp reviews mean little, but make no mistake, you can get better McD pretty much everywhere else. This branch is pretty awful. I mean, you might not get food poisoning (as I have), but why gamble? So many other places. This branch is horrendous."
1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2016-08-27,2.0,"Came here late on a Sunday night because not much else was open and I was starving. There seemed to be only 2 staff members working at the time. One at the register, who was also going back and forth from the back. Another was at the back. At the time it seemed like they would take about 3 orders at a time, ignore who was in line until those 3 orders were served. It was quite the wait. I had a sweet tea along with my quarter pounder and the sweet tea was way too sweet than how it normally tastes. This place doesn't have a self serve for your drinks. Refills aren't free so you have to buy another drink. Trash can was piling up pretty high.

Only didn't give 1 star because the staff was still friendly and nice, although I don't agree with the idea of only taking few orders at a time and leave a line waiting."
1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2018-10-17,2.0,"They ight. It wasn't terrible, but I have had better. They forgot some parts of my friends meal, and gave the wrong shake. The food could have been warmer."
1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2017-09-23,1.0,"This McDonald's is the worst. There are a few good employees, but most are too busy socializing to help the customers. The food is slapped together haphazardly. The managers don't give a crap about anything. They sell you items that they are sold out of, then get in a huff when you want a refund rather than a substitution. Stay away."
1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2013-08-06,1.0,"All I wanted was some fries.

Two registers open, and the line was insane.

The staff were in zombie mode, everything was so slow and it didn't seem like they liked working there at all.  Their movements and actions resembled a zombie, brainless and lifeless.

After ordering my fries, it took them about 5- 8 minutes to get it.

Total time it took from the moment I stepped in to the time I stepped out, 20 minutes!  Just for fries!"
1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2017-03-26,5.0,No complaints here. Very typical McDonald's with things moving very fast once the cashier takes your order and waiting not even a minute before I heard my order number being called. The seating area is cozy and there's more space upstairs if you are unable to find a spot on the main floor.
1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2011-10-21,1.0,"McDonald's is the ultimate fast food that describes ICK!

In my past life of adult times where employed in this region of the poor house days, I'd very seldom patronize but undergoing a eight hour day without substance was near fading out.  Midtown West McDonald's where it sits on Eighth Avenue that contains reasonable prices by Midtown standards.  This is where tourists go in hopes of attaining a piece of the American culture.  

Blah, it's McDonald's where the joy of clogging your cholesterol can be acquired anywhere in the world.  Follow the congested line waiting for your order, and do follow the excessive high cholesterol clog."

1120,mcdonalds-new-york-151,2015-06-19,1.0,I just went there to have my burger. Obvioulsly the woman who took my order did not want to care but yawning. I have been waiting there for more than 15 mins while other took their oders. When I finally asked about my orders all I got from her was her attitude and was telling me that 'give her money back'. If they have cameras to recorded then it  will show I even gave them some tips just wanted to appreciate what they were doing at night time. And this is what I got from them?

1123,starbucks-new-york-526,2018-02-15,5.0,"I'm so glad I discovered this place. It's probably the best Starbucks near Grand Central (and I've been to all of them)! For starters, lines here are never all that long because this place is not easy to find (off Lexington avenue where the masses seem to stay for coffee). That being said, perhaps lines will get a bit longer with a positive review like this one. The experience here is terrific as well!

With Starbucks offering the same products at all locations, what really makes any sort of difference is the speed of the service, quality of service, availability of options and ambiance/cleanliness. In all the above, this place excels! Some of the friendliest baristas in midtown are located right here (look no further)! A few in particular greet you with a very friendly hello and a smile (unheard of in Manhattan most of the time). They also move very quickly here, too. You won't have to wait more than a minute or so for your drink. As always, if you're really in a rush, place your order on the Starbucks app ahead of time to find your drink/food waiting for you when you arrive about 5 minutes later.

This place is also very clean and makes you feel more confident about ordering a pastry from the shelf.

The one downside? This place is small! There are no indoor seats, although there are a few places to sit outside.

Service really makes all the difference here (and those short waits). Looking forward to returning!"
1123,starbucks-new-york-526,2017-09-18,5.0,"I love this location and the baristas are WONDERFUL here. I went to the location over at 685 3rd Ave one morning and the baristas were talking crap about my drink (because I had personalized it) and were saying things about me because of it, and ever since then, I refused to go to that location. After that situation, I started coming to this location and have loved the baristas here. Everyone is always happy and smiling and my drinks always come out exactly like I want them. I was even there one morning when their mobile order machine stopped printing orders and they handled it with grace and patience, and were never rude. Instead of causing problems, they're always looking for solutions."

However, they refused to give me a drip coffee refill. Starbucks's policy is that, if you don't leave the premises, you can get a free hot/iced drip coffee/tea refill, even if you buy a more expensive beverage. I emailed SBUX corporate to let them know and they recited their policy but didn't say they would make sure the store enforced it. Hmmm..."

As soon as I entered the store I noticed the floor was littered and the sugar area was dirty and messy. That's the first thing I notice when I go to any coffee shop and it usually turns me off immediately.

My order took longer than usual which I wont hold against them because they seemed to be short staffed on the night I stopped by. My drink was fine by Starbucks standards."

There was a lock on the door and the barista promptly gave me the code when I asked for it.  It took a while for my drink to be made, even though the restaurant was not crazy busy.  There was not a very good selection of pastries, even though I was there early in the day."

1124,starbucks-new-york-310,2018-12-22,1.0,Horrible customer service we are paying customers and the fact that the workers talk to people like we owe them something ...
1124,starbucks-new-york-310,2019-07-14,5.0,Favorite Starbucks EVERRR!! I love the drinks and the fast service but the number one reason I made this my go to is because of the employees they are amazing always smiling they remembered my name after my first visit and know my order before I do:) they make sure you feel welcomed nothing but good vibes here CeCe
1124,starbucks-new-york-310,2016-12-11,3.0,Funky lay out. Not easy to order and pick up. Baristas friendly. Service was very slow. But it's cold and Sunday. Watching people get their drinks way before our order not ok. No sense of urgency.
1124,starbucks-new-york-310,2018-08-06,5.0,This is my favorite Starbucks in the area! The staff is so friendly and they always have my order just right.
1124,starbucks-new-york-310,2015-09-29,3.0,"I swear, I've never seen this Starbucks before...or maybe I just haven't been paying attention. 

After a long drive back from the Catskills (...you know, one of those three hour Sunday drives that turns into five because traffic sucks on I-87 southbound...), I returned my rental car and needed both a restroom and a drink. (Bathroom first, of course. Haaa.) The beau and I went inside; this location has obviously had a recent renovation. It was pretty spiffy, right down to the new tables with the power spots and a shiny Clover machine. The restroom smelled like death, but that's nothing new for most Starbucks. (Erg.) The baristas seemed fine; the beau ordered as I sat at the coffee bar, so I didn't really interact with them. 

It's just another Starbucks in midtown, but it did the trick."
1124,starbucks-new-york-310,2018-07-17,5.0,Great Staff! At first I didn't like the location but once I got to know the staff they completely changed my view.
1124,starbucks-new-york-310,2015-03-13,3.0,"I really like the renovation.   They created a bar stool section that can sit four people.   This area use to be the drink pick up section.   The renovation really opened up more seating which is a plus because at about 75% of the Starbucks I go to in NYC has limited to no seating.   What I just mentioned is a plus to the company but a thorn on the side of the customer.   What can I say, it's either you got it that minute you walked in or you don't.   The drinks are made swiftly and quickly.   The drink taste good and I am always satisfied.   I give this starbucks a big thumbs up!"
1124,starbucks-new-york-310,2018-03-27,5.0,"I only really come here before 6:30am and I have to say it starts my day out on such a good foot. They men working at that time have the music going and the positive attitudes blasting. To the employees, all the men customers are ""chief"" and all women customers are ""love"" or ""sweetheart"" - this is in a friendly and very welcomed way. You'll find the same thing in every Starbucks but I look forward to going to this particular one for the A+++ employees."
1124,starbucks-new-york-310,2017-01-08,4.0,"Good cafe. Staff is friendly and fast service. I like Starbucks in general since I like their coffee. Some are slow, some are fast. I'd recommend this one. :)"
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2019-12-27,4.0,"Ariel was such a lovely, friendly barista! He suggested I get an almond milk vanilla flat white, and even though it was my first flat white ever, I can confidently say it was delicious. He and his co-workers handled the crazy line during free coffee hour really well. This location doesn't have much space, but there's a little bit of seating."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2019-10-07,1.0,"I work in the same building as this Starbucks so I go here a lot for convenience but this is probably the worst location I've been to in all of Manhattan. Slowest service you could imagine, even when there's no one else in the store. They never have cream cheese in stock either. I'll walk across the street to go to another one, I always leave this location annoyed and it's really not worth it."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2018-07-27,5.0,I been here a few times. The service is pretty friendly compared to other Starbucks. Anthony is a great barista. I asked for drinks with no caffeine and he suggested options. Making it easy
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2017-05-13,4.0,"Yikes, how can a Starbucks have 2.5 stars? It's a Starbucks...lol. Giving this place a 4 star rating because we came here with a bunch of family and ordered a BUNCH of drinks and they all came out right. No complaints there. We also all needed to use the bathroom so before we even started ordering the barista was kind enough to give us the code so that we could start forming a line, haha. So, thanks barista =).  Good experience and yummy drinks."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2018-07-12,3.0,"I come here around 6:50AM before work. Usually not many customers. Staff is generally very nice but they need to pick up the pace on orders. I understand that it's early in the morning so they probably haven't gotten into the rhythm of things, but waiting 10+ minutes for a simple drink when there are little to no people should not happen. Additionally, I have gotten extremely watered down drinks before, almost like water. Quality is inconsistent. I appreciate the good attitudes of the staff here though."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2017-12-04,5.0,Great team working here. Brightened up my day before I had my morning coffee. They all deserve a round of applause. Especially fond of their team spirit and positive attitude. Wish the rest of the world could make work look like so much fun.
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2017-08-01,4.0,Coffee is coffeee. Just a lil small but does the job. Close to the church so keep us cool for the walk.
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2017-04-25,1.0,"The service is absolutely terrible. Didn't hear ""tall decaf"" and was snorted at when picking it up. Ran by 18 year olds with an attitude. Never again."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2016-12-28,1.0,"They sold me a muffin made two days ago. Hard as a rock. Unacceptable. I think a big company like Starbucks has to have strong quality parameters, avoiding this to happen"
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2015-04-11,1.0,"I would give a 0 but it's not allowed, sign says 6am its 6:05 and they are still messing around...management should conduct a training session on opening on time."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2014-03-19,4.0,"One of my usual spots for a Starbucks run while in the office. The baristas are quick and friendly and there's usually never too long of a wait. There aren't many tables/seats available here so it's probably best to grab 'n go but in the warmer months, it's nice to sit outside and take a break. 

Added perk: your coffee comes with a smiley face on the cup next to your name (always nice to see a smiley especially in the middle of a weekday)!"
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2015-12-30,1.0,"I am not a regular yelper and never leave reviews like this HOWEVER, I have also never experienced worse customer service in my life. Although the store is inundated with staff, no one attempts to help customers and have full, casual conversations in front of the people waiting in line, watching them. After waiting for 15 minutes at the front of the line to get a coffee, someone from the back decided the line was getting too long and decided to help me. I asked for a grande drip coffee. I paid $2.50 (about) and he gave me my coffee and moved onto the next customer. I then realized it was a small so I turned around and asked if this coffee was in fact a small. He said yes. I then repeated that I asked for a medium and he told me ""ok, but it would cost me extra."" I pulled out 00.50 to hand to him and he proceeded to tell me to wait while he helped the next three customers before angrily handing me the medium coffee I ordered, rolling his eyes and literally SHOOING me away. All in all, I spent over 30 minutes trying to get a single cup of coffee in an originally empty store. 

This place makes me never want to go in another Starbucks again. Horrible."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2016-07-28,1.0,"Suffered through an entire week of going to this location, as they are one of the worst I've ever been to. Luckily there's one at 49th and Madison Avenue. They are much better."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2017-05-11,2.0,"Much friendlier and faster service today. The cashier didn't ask me what size I wanted and I wound up with a grande instead of the tall I wanted (my fault, I guess). The barista didn't put put the crushed graham crackers on top of my s'mores frap which was disappointing. He seemed new at making it, and possibly making drinks period. Someone returned a drink while I was waiting. I grabbed it and ran. For that price, I really shouldn't have to examine it to make sure it was made correctly. In my opinion, it had way too much chocolate syrup too. I was given a sample a couple days ago (from a different location) and have been chasing the taste of that sample ever since. Yesterday was bleh and today was worse. I should probably try another Starbuck's, but this one is the most convenient. I am usually not a Starbuck's person."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2015-05-25,4.0,Mohammad was great very friendly. He introduce a lot of different flavor to our group. Never really tried anything but their passion lemonade. I'm now a Starbucks Fan.
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2015-02-10,3.0,Probably one of the better Starbuck's around. They actually have pretty decent pastries here and it's not that crowded!
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2012-06-21,5.0,"5 stars for the sexy barista taking orders, guys a hustler.

My favorite Sbux in the city, however its still pretty average. Stop there before the office at around 8am. Pretty much always get in and out thanks to the quickness of their assembly-line-like method. There are sometimes when there's annoying international tourists who don't know how to order and hold everyone else up, but for the most part they move them along."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2015-09-15,1.0,"This Starbucks has the most unprofessional staff I have ever encountered at a service establishment.  Located in the heart of Midtown, the clientele is almost entirely people working in the surrounding financial and professional buildings.  To roll your eyes, raise your voice and speak down to a client when there could be myriad of other patrons with whom they work is beyond disrespectful.  And then to openly speak loudly about the patron after they've ordered while onsite management joins in on the gossip? Staff needs to be trained in professional courtesy and taught how to elevate their manners.  I have never been spoken to by anyone the way I was spoken to this morning over coffee.  Starbucks Customer Service should reevaluate the staff at this location.

ETA: Starbucks Customer Service was absolutely fantastic, the retail locations could learn a lot from the poise of the corporate representatives."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2013-11-27,3.0,This place is always busy and thus the baristas tend to be on top of their game. Seating is limited and often awkward when one sits down.
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2013-07-08,3.0,"I agree with most people that the customer service sucks. But after coming to this Starbucks almost everyday for a year, I realized the problem. The female workers always mess up the drinks and the male workers don't. Has anyone else noticed that?! It seems as if the female workers don't care or aren't paying attention to the specific orders. But when the group of guys are making the drinks, there is a much better flow at the line and my orders come out perfect! Now I feel discouraged when I come into the store and  I see the girls making the drinks."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2012-12-03,5.0,love this starbucks!!! The guys in the morning are super friendly and quick. I spend less than 5 mins here here.
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2010-04-27,2.0,"I like stopping in before work and they prepare my drink usually pretty close to perfection.  I've given it a bit of a low review however because they are not always the most friendly there with the customers.  Most of the time they are too busy talking to each other.  Most other SBux that I usually go to throughout the city or world for that matter get to know you have a handful of visits.

This is really a generalization as there are some people that are great just not as a whole...I generally walk out if there is a line as it is not worth waiting here since the one on 50/Lex is super fast and generally really friendly!"
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2011-03-02,3.0,"The place is clean & the staff works fast. However, they do not listen to what you are ordering. I'm not picky, just very particular when it comes to my drink. I sure hope they get better at listening & paying attention."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2012-09-04,1.0,"This has to be one of the worst Starbucks in terms of customer service.  The staff seems more interested in laughing and joking than working.  I go there because I work upstairs, but they usually forget my simple order and I stand around like a fool for several minutes.  They take names to go with the drinks at the register but no one ever writes them down.  They make fun of customers -- including referring to a man as ""queer"" in front of a full line of people.  They are truly the worst. Is there a manager who supervises any of this nonsense?"
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2013-06-24,1.0,"Agree with others that customer services is lousy here. After several tries, I chose to walk few blocks more to avoid encounter rude services....."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2012-12-24,1.0,"This is the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. I ordered a cinnamon swirl and repeated twice but I still got the wrong cake in the paper bag. The vanilla latte tastes more like vanilla milk, with little amount of coffee flavor in it. And the worst part is the customer service. The long hair staff wearing a red apron ( seems like it was she who makes the latte for me and the milk was split on the outside of the cup when she was making the coffee so I got some milk on my hand too when I grab the cup ) is so rude and arrogant to me as a customer. The bathroom door was shut with a small "" in use"" on the handle, but I just wanted to make sure that there was actually someone using it. I'm sure we all have the experience that the door sign is broken, with ""in use"" on the handle all the time but the room is empty. I rotated the handle and pushed the door once and was sure that the bathroom was in use,so I turned around and leave, but the longhair staff rushed out of the bathroom and said to me as if she was teaching me, (something like knock the door if you see the bathroom is in use) with a scornful tone and face in front of other people in the store. I will never visit this store again. And if you don't change, you will lost a lot of customers in the future."
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2011-06-01,4.0,By far the friendlist Starbucks I've been to in the city.  They usually move the morning rush hour line along quickly and I've never had a problem with my order.  What more can you ask for from a Starbucks?
1130,starbucks-new-york-565,2008-12-30,1.0,"Being that I used to work super close to this location years ago, this was the Starbucks I frequented. Despite the fact that the workers were usually very friendly and helpful and the beverages were good, one horrifying instance where I bought a slice of some type of bread (I believe it was banana bread) invades my memory. After eating about 1/3 of the slice, I looked closely and noticed there were small patches of mold on it. MOLD! I was disgusted. Hopefully, this was a one-time fluke instance and not a common occurance. But regardless, ever since, I've refused to purchase any similar food item from any Starbucks anywhere."
1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2019-03-15,3.0,"Owned by McDonalds Trump, what more do you need to know - AVOID.

My first experience with this McDonald's this most recent time, and was pretty bad because they would not let me use the bathroom. When I came here earlier in the day though, the following day, then they totally would - so it was a little bit better because everybody needs a bathroom in Times Square.

I used to eat at this McDonald's when I was a teenager. A lot has changed but this McD hasn't changed much. It's one of the busiest in the world, in fact. Extra star for having a bathroom, lose a star for denying it to me when I needed it late.

My alt review said - At the second time of asking this McDonald's which is way way too hot and has the heating cranked up far too high, was a good stop because I was able to use the restroom - but they close the restroom off early each day and it doesn't help people at night that need to use it. Products are typical McDonald's fare.

It's not as nice as it was all those years ago when I used to come here in the middle of the night."
1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2018-07-25,3.0,"I came here several times during my last visit to New York and it was always very busy. However the wait for the food wasn't very long as the employees were cranking out the orders like a well-oiled machine! It was a pretty warm weekend, so it was nice that they had two very large portable air conditioners pumping out very cold air.

One of things that's weird about this place was that there was a big fat pillar right in front of the registers. It definitely led to confusion on where to line up to place your order. Every now and then they would station an employee there just to direct and help with the flow of customers.

On one of my visits, the mobile app wasn't working. At least it was still able to generate the QR code for me to use one of the deals on the app. I think this was one of the few McDonald's where they didn't have kiosks for you to place your order.

Overall the quality of the food was pretty standard and the service was nice and fast, so I wouldn't mind coming back here again for some good tried and true McDonald's food."
1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2019-11-02,1.0,"My review is mostly to talk about how an incident here happened and how it was handled-or not handled. My 1st time here was at 1am after work this evening. A crazed looking man 30-40's came in with a young woman in about her 20's at the same time as myself. He was verbally and physically abusive to her, but the supposed security at the door did nothing at all to help her and neither did any of the many male patrons, other than to meekly tell him to ""Leave her alone."" She was on the floor crawling at one point while he was hanging on to her leg. He also was strong-arming her shoulders to try to restrict her movement. As far as I know, I was the only one who took any action by calling 911 to try to get police to help the situation. The police arrived after both parties had left separately at different times, but still, I was pretty shocked no one tried to really seem to help the young lady other then myself by taking action to call the police. The only action I saw the supposed security take was to put a printout of a paper on the door saying ""THIS STORE WILL BE CLOSING AT 3AM"" after the man and woman had left. The staff at the register was very nice and my order came out correctly, although it took them about 15 minutes to put together my ""Fast Food."" The only person I saw trying to help the young woman at all after her crazy bf or friend had left was a man I later saw sweeping the floor, so I don't know if he was a manager or a porter. 
In contrast, The McDonald's on 8th Ave and 43rd that sadly closed had such a great security guy there that I never saw any incidents like this happening there, and he was more than willing to tell customers when they had to leave and was firm about it and handled situations. 
So, if you go here and get in any trouble or are assaulted, don't expect any help from the paid security here if that's what they really are standing at the door there, because the man there was not wearing a security uniform, etc., so I don't really know what his title was."
1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2020-02-21,1.0,Really not reflecting McDonald values. The female manager on the evenings work hard but she seemed to be cursed with her staff. Go to cchick-a-fillet a few block up
1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2020-02-04,2.0,"Went to get some food for my parents and I. They gave me old unsalted fries, and an old flat Sprite. I asked for Tropic Berry Sprite and I was given regular sprite that was sitting there so long there was no ice in it. They always give the wrong sauces, don't listen  when asking for preferences in meals/drinks and always have a nasty attitude."
1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2018-10-31,1.0,"Wow. Probably the worst place I have been to. 

All we wanted was some coffee on a crisp Sunday. While my mom waited for the coffee, we were sitting at the McDonald's tables. 20 minutes in, and no updates. My boyfriend went to check in and eventually switch places with my mom, so she could get a chance to sit. Another 15 minutes passed, and nothing has come up. We came in at around 5:20 PM, and 28 minutes has to pass before we could even get ONE cup of coffee. What a shame, considering we had ordered three cups of coffee. 

We were on a time crunch, so we had to settle for the sole cup of coffee and head out. However, I see my mom waiting at the front of the line, in desperate hope of getting the remaining 2 cups of coffee we ordered earlier. My boyfriend and I checked out the front of the line, and I noticed it just looked like a madhouse. Hangry customers almost to the point of fighting each other were packed closer together than Walmart sardines in a can. Somehow my boyfriend snakes his way through the front so he could ask the employee about the 2 remaining cups of coffee. Sensing the indignation in his tone, the employee quickly whipped up the 2 cups of coffee left and gave them to us. 

What a relief it was to leave that madhouse, only to notice the coffee order was wrong. 3 cups of coffee ordered, 2 cups delayed, and 1 cup was wrong. What a waste of 40 minutes - but I guess this is the type of service we should expect when in the Times Square area."
1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2019-01-31,5.0,"I don't ever go to McDonald's, but when I do, it is at the one in Time Square. I came here after a late night work event and I was so happy to! Cant go wrong with a double cheeseburger and some McDonald's fries. People forget they have a special recipe with coke a cola and with Heinz which is why McDonald's specifically has AMAZING ketchup and coke! When I dropped all my chicken nuggets on the floor, I was devastated. Thankfully, the nice lady at the counter saw I was upset and had them make me more! That is service McDonald's! No wonder you have been around for so long."
1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2020-02-02,2.0,This place never has any dessert available. And service tends to be fairly rude. No excuse for that considering the amount of people that come here every day near Times Square

1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2019-07-23,1.0,The sign says dine in 24 hours but the staff just stared and wouldn't let us in. Seems off to advertise as 24 hours. Had I known the advertisement was fake I would have walked to another establishment. Very disappointed (which is saying a lot because in the wee hours of the morning my expectations were already low for any eatery).
1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2019-06-12,1.0,"Everyone is miserable at this McDonald location. The staff are very lazy, rude, and inconsiderate that you just feel like you're not even welcomed to this location. So long story short, the line is very unorganized that it's scrambled everywhere and believe it or not, many tourist people are in this location a lot because of course, it's time square. So I was taking my order, the cashier is very rude towards me and her tone was like she doesn't care about her job. And then as I got my order, the staff had messed up my order and I realized that something is missing until I notify them that I'm missing the order until they gave me an attitude for no reason as if I bother them. So they threw the order at me rather than giving it by hand and they gave me this dead stare which I thought, ""wow, what kind of business and management are they running?"" I'm telling you, they need a better management, teamwork and more because the place is a total mess!  Absolutely not! 
Bathroom is dirty and I definitely won't be coming back to this location."
1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2018-07-19,3.0,"This McDonald's has a pretty poor floor plan, and as a result the experience is pretty chaotic. Seating is literally crammed in between large bearing beams, leaving little room for customers in line. The lines are rather disorganized, and it can be tough to know which line you are in, at any given time. The 'wait' area is just as chaotic and busy as you have to contort yourself and maneuver to get to the register to get your food.

The service is pretty decent depending on when you go, but sometimes they get the order wrong, like they may forget to put the bacon on your sandwich, or give you the wrong sandwich, or forget the meat (Where's the beef?)! Speaking of the meat, I am pleased that this McDonald's sometimes uses ""fresh beef"", but this location doesn't cook the beef properly. The burgers are always pink inside, and I end up not being able to eat the entire burger. Make sure you check your burger before you leave, unless you want to upgrade to a Double Beef Parasite With Cheese.

Not a terrible experience, but an unfortunate store layout, and under-cooked food takes it down a few notches."

1131,mcdonalds-new-york-429,2018-03-08,2.0,"Reviewing a McDonald's is such an empty threat. What am I going to do? Not go back? I've literally already been back twice since the experience I'm writing about happened. I also don't think corporate is pouring over yelp reviews to mine opportunities for process improvements. 

But I just think it's really funny how this location says they are open 24/7, but they always evict me between 2:00/3:00am. One of the employees came by to take our trash (omg, table service at McDonald's???), but honestly, he was rushing us out and the bag he threw away had like four french fries in it. I want my damn fries.

The lady behind the counter, who I assume is the shift manager, kept shouting, ""GOOOOOO YOU HAVE TO GOOOOOO"" with increasingly guttural desperation. It felt like her next move was going to be to throw chairs at us, so we left."

Food is the same as any other McDonald's but the lines can get a bit chaotic at times.

What impressed  me was how the whole operation ran so well. None of the employees  had nasty  attitudes all were very helpful and the manager  made it run like a well oiled  machine. This was on Saturday afternoon memorial weekend. Good jod to everyone  there! Wish every McDonalds I walked into ran like your did.
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2020-05-20,3.0,"Well it's a nice place to meet up with a friend but it is a little on the pricey side. It was convenient to where I needed to be but I don't love the food sadly. I never seem to have a good meal, the wait staff seem to disappear and I don't know why this happens! I love the decor of the place and it always feel like a charming little venue! I always want something less filling than what it is on the menu and it seems difficult to get them to oblige!"
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2019-03-24,3.0,"The short: great neighborhood staple that I'm happy to have around, and wouldn't go out of my way to come here otherwise. 

The longer: they do coffee and teas very well and very quickly. If you want a beverage and a pastry-- you can be in and out of here in a jiffy. 

If you want a prepared meal (sit in or to go), you have to be prepared to wait. The food quality is good, and it takes 10-15 minutes for things to be prepared. I'm okay with this when I'm working (using free Wi-Fi) or here for a catch-up with a friend, but now know not to come here for prepared food if I'm in a rush. 

The staff are all usually very nice, and this is a good LPQ as far as LPQs go!"
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2019-03-15,3.0,"Counter service, but also a sit down restaurant in back. Outdoor seating as well. Free WI-FI and lots of outlets, so it is a good place to do work. In the counter service section there is one large communal table, a couple of stools at a table by the window, and a few tables. Food and coffee is decent, but it is very overpriced and the service is very slow."
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2019-09-03,5.0,"Not always the biggest LPQ fan, but I spent ~4 hours here working on a quiet Tuesday morning and the staff could not have been more lovely and accommodating. Fresh and tasty food, free WiFi and a waitress who was going out of her way to ensure I had everything I needed while making me feel totally welcome to stay and work made for a great experience."
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2018-06-19,1.0,"Service is super slow, I walked in at 1:15pm and placed my order, it is now 1:45pm and still no food. The seating area with waitress service is half empty and I ordered from the To Go line. 

Saw an employee change out the garbage bag; I hope he washed his hands because then I saw him take a loaf of bread with his bare hands to the back. Is that what my avocado toast is going to be made on?

I ordered the Baker's Lunch: soup of the day (split pea), half avocado toast and quinoa taboule salad. 

Will NOT recommend this LPQ. The one at Roosevelt Field Mall Neiman Marcus has me spoiled.  Just got my food- order is wrong. Thanks guys."
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2018-11-18,2.0,"As much as I've like to give this place a better rating then its average 2-star rating, I'd say others experience with this place is spot-on with ours.  We walked in fairly late on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and there were a few tables open but all of them still had dirty dishes on them.  When we asked to get the table cleaned from a waitress walking by, she snapped back I'll be right with you only to disappear for another 5-10 minutes.  We had to move the dishes aside just to sit down comfortably at the table.  When the table was finally cleared, it took another 10-15 min for the waitress to come back to take our orders.  Once the orders arrived, we were missing utensils and had to wait for that to arrive as well.  Besides the sugar for our coffees that didn't arrive until near the end of the meal, the food itself is a fairly small serving for the price.  With this level of service, you're better off going to Dunkin Donuts (similar food quality and experience with dirty tables). 

The location and name should really be a much better experience than it was.  Management should really hire more staff and better train staff in customer service."
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2018-12-19,1.0,Terrible service and the food was VERY disappointing.  I would not recommend this location. It did not meet the standards of other Le Pain Quotidien that I have patronized.
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2019-06-23,1.0,"I ordered a hazelnut flute to go and when I bit into it, it was hard as a rock.  How old is this pastry? I don't think it was fresh at all.  Had to throw it out."
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2019-06-13,1.0,"I go into this LPQ 1-2 times per day. I went in today for my second coffee at 1215-30 and thought I had exact change for the coffee and I was 5 cents short. The person at the register made the coffee, took my money and told me she would hold the coffee and my money so I could go and get 5 cents. It was pouring outside also, so I ran across the street while she held the $3.80 and coffee and got 5 cents. I decided just to get my money back because I will never go to this establishment ever again. I told the lady at the register that that was horrible customer service and she looked at me like a deer in the headlights. I will never go here again."
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2019-07-14,1.0,So today I wanted hot chocolate and a bakery item. I ordered a hot chocolate with oat milk bc I don't like whole milk and the waiter was like it won't be good but okay I will put the order in. Like don't say that to a customer.
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2019-07-08,5.0,Great service today and a perfect soft- boiled egg with avo toast & salad. Really nice calm atmosphere for lunch on this rainy Monday.
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2018-02-05,3.0,"Eh, it was pretty okay. I had their new organic egg & avocado breakfast sandwich, as advertised by their sandwich sign out front. 

The service was ok - I'm glad I'm not afraid to ask questions, as there isn't much signage for where to order because they also have seating in the back. So: restaurant café. 

This was my first time there & I haven't decided if I'll be back yet. After waiting about 15-20 mins, I received my sandwich, walked back to my place, a block away. After sitting down to eat, I unwrap a messy breakfast sandwich much to my dismay. Seems like it was put together in a rush. :-/ the bread wasn't tasty either."
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2018-09-08,1.0,"There is good service, bad service and ZERO service. I live next door and have always had either bad service or zero service here. It's the worst. I'm surprised it is still open. Don't waste your time. Head across the street to JIMBO's or Madison Diner"
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2018-07-21,2.0,This location is average. I had a poor experience with service and waited over 30 minutes for my to-go sandwich and coffee. The management didn't seem apologetic and acted like it was normal for me to stand there and wait for a coffee for 30 minutes. One of the more poor experiences I've had at LPQ.
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2018-06-14,1.0,"Awful service, took forever to bring out my order that I had made for pick up 30 mins before I even got there. Ended up waiting a total of 1 hour for my lunch!! Do not recommend if you are in a rush. Quality of food at this location was also sub-par."
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2019-04-09,1.0,"The service is really bad! Be prepared to wait forever for them to come take your order or bring you the check. The food is not bad, but unfortunately the waiting is too long!"
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2018-04-21,1.0,Terrible terrible service. Waited forty minutes for a to-go order (they were having trouble with oven apparently) and when I finally got home the order was wrong and missing things.
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2018-03-30,2.0,Always horrible service. Always forgetting something. Never checks up on you after serving. Have to call waitresses for every thing.
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2016-12-07,4.0,"Really solid food paired with really terrible service. I've been frequenting Le pain my entire life throughout the world and truly do enjoy the food. Do not come to this location if you're in any sort of rush. If you're bringing your laptop or a book and looking to get some work done then le pain is the perfect spot. 

Yesterday I had the roasted turkey avocado tartine. It was very tasty. They used plenty of avocado. There was an avocado base that was spread out on the bread and then there was pieces of avocado as well. They garnish it with cucumbers, pickles and radishes. Really good lunch. I've also enjoyed their quinoa and farro salad. Their spreads are also unbelievable so be sure to order some breads."
1139,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-132,2018-08-02,1.0,I have never had a good experience at one of these places. How do they even stay open? Nasty staff. Long waits. Dry chicken and tasteless salads. Last time I'll be back.
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2017-05-05,3.0,"I'll admit this location is very convenient especially if you take the E/M train. Recently they changed the morning pickup areas. Coffee pickup on the left of cashier, everything else on the right. It makes it inconvenient for me especially if I'm ordering a wrap and a coffee so I need to go to 2 sides to pick up my whole order. 

DD overall: I love using the app to order in advance. It is relatively cheaper than starbucks especially when they have deals. Downside: whenever they have special offers, I can't order on the app. I have to wait in line to order for them to apply the discount. Another downside: If you order iced coffee with sugar, the sugar does not melt on the bottom and you end up sipping up full sugar. They should get on the liquid sugar bandwagon. Third downside: I feel their beverages are watered down. When I get a medium iced coffee, it just tastes like flavored water."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2016-04-23,3.0,"Unlike Starbucks which has a level of consistency across there stores worldwide, Dunkin' Donuts fails to maintain a standard beyond store fronts, signs, and logos. And I not taking about service or language issues here but on product availability.

Here is one case;  Munchkins, ya, whats the big deal, well different Dunkin' Donuts, will either prepare them in house while others are shipped from other stores or central baking facilities depending of the franchise and how big or busy they are. 

Munchkins come in 6 flavors which are Glazed; Glazed Chocolate; Jelly; Powdered Sugar; Cinnamon; Sugar Raised (plan and boring).

But depending on the store some only carry 3 and are delivered by street hand cart while others like this one have them all and are baked in house. I have tried dozen of different Dunkin' Donuts stores in Manhattan alone which I read had over 500 stores several years ago. So this store is my go to store for donuts and munchkin because of the number of different flavors available and freshness in the morning."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2018-12-14,1.0,Horrible service! I got late for work because of waiting and waiting for my order that took forever and it was a wrong one. Then the cashier lady came to me telling me that that's the one I ordered. They don't usually give the receipt especially in the morning but i should have taken the receipt to have a proof next time. Slow and poor service
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2019-06-14,3.0,"Tastes as I expect. Price is good. That's why I gave 3 stars but service is horrible. They let ppl ordering coffee skip lines. They give you a number at the cashier noting they will use it but for a pickup, they never use it. There was a huge confusion. Couldn't really hear what was prepared."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2017-12-02,2.0,"I didn't think anyone could mess up something in a Dunkin' Donuts. Save yourselves. Just wanted some quick to get over the hungries and geez, I'm still hungry. I couldn't eat it. Egg, sausage and cheese on flatbread. I guess my fault for even eating here while in NY."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2018-11-03,1.0,"It's not like Dunkin Donuts is ever that great, but this is probably the worst one I've ever been to. The staff is slow, rude, and sometimes just doesn't feel like waiting on customers."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2016-03-24,1.0,"I'll keep this one simple. I entered said Dunkin Donuts, order a coffee coolita, which I waited damn near 10 minutes for! Received a tan colored milk slushy, asked for a replacement and received yet another milk slushy, which was awful by the way! Demanded a refund and walked out and vow never to return!"
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2013-02-01,4.0,"I recently signed up to be DD reward member online and they mailed me a postcard coupon for a free medium sized drink! 

The coupon doesn't expire til the end of Feb.. but on my way home after a long day of clinic, I decided to stop by to pick up my freebie :). I desperately needed a little extra caffeine in my system especially since my fiance was having a friend over for dinner.

I see this DD branch at least twice a day (on my way to school and on my way back). Usually a long line in the morning but almost completely dead by the time I come home. I almost never get coffee .. so going in..  i was a total newb. Latte? what is that.. hey there's a green lite sign next to it! Sounds least fattening enough. I asked for a vanilla latte lite medium to go. The staff was extremely friendly and didn't mind my presentation of a coupon. At first he asked me what that was.. and joked with me asking how I managed to get it. He asked me a couple of times if i wanted sugar. I didn't know if lite comes with sugar.. so I just said no. In the end he offered me sweeteners and even gave me extra packs to go. 

The latte was steamy and delicious! Will definitely return more latte goodness. Will try caramel next time :)"
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2013-05-12,1.0,"This is going to be a short one:

I asked for a coffee roll, not a coffee roll with green spots (see pics ...)

I still love you, Dunkin ... but not this particular location."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2015-03-09,4.0,"The food and drink is the same as other Dunkin' Donuts.  It's not better or worse.

This location does offer the Baskin-Robbins counter if you want ice cream or need an ice cream cake.

The service here is very good.  The staff is often younger and very friendly.  There are a lot of staff members here in the morning during the morning rush.  If you have a hard time understanding them or visa versa then just repeat yourself but I've not really had any problems.

The location is in the basement of 875 Third Avenue by the E/M 53rd & Lex subway station.  Seating is available in the basement food court of 875 Third Avenue."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2016-07-13,1.0,"What's there to say that hasn't been said about DD already. These people never listen to your order preferences and just make it to their liking. 

And who the hell writes a review about DD? You turkeys will still go here."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2016-01-30,4.0,This dunkin donuts is Located on 52nd and 3rd I came here just to grab a small hot tea. There was a line. Many wise This dunkin donuts is the same as every other franchise.
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2016-08-13,3.0,"on my way to work and a dozen donuts with a container of joe (coffee ) for my coworkers should make them happy on a saturday morning. the location is 3rd ave between 53rd and 52th st in the lower level near the lexington ave train station .there is no seating inside but there is outdoor seating area nearby which is good if you have some time on your hands before you hit work. the usual dd setup with donuts, breakfast sandwiches , hot and cold drinks , etc. i was a little leary buying donuts from a basement location near the dirty subway but the donuts looked fresh and i was not eating any so so big deal (only kidding ) overall a convient location for the morning commuters who need a little dd before hitting work."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2012-11-20,2.0,"No. No. No. No. No ... I am sorry fellow yelpers who enjoy this place ... but....

 I enjoy D&D VERY VERY much ....so much that I usually frequent each and every one or at least try them when I see one or cross one I have not been in before. This one was horrible..from the very start the attitude while I was ordering was unacceptable .. to the way the teaspoon of cream cheese was half smeared on one side of my bagel... i felt like I was eating a damned burnt piece of bread with nothing on it when I finally sat down to eat this ""Food"" ... I am so happy I got two Boston creme dough-nuts along with my bagel or else I would have died from the taste. And I am also so happy that the dough nuts are not made to order or else my Boston cremes would have been burnt jelly doughnut bites. I was a part of what Aaron R. described as ""a bit of a hectic scene"" and yes I considered the fact that its midtown too ... but I know single men who operate those little coffee carts that they are locked in like a prison cell and serve up to 4X the people and properly give them what they ordered."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2014-04-24,1.0,Unequivocally the WORST Dunkin Donuts there is.  The entire staff should be fired and pushed into a woodchipper.  They are incapable of getting an order correct.
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2012-08-17,4.0,"I found the holy grail. A dunkin donuts in E Midtown. Not only that but its JUST a DD. 
Not a DD/baskin robbins; not a DD/KFC; just a DD. 

Definitely made my morning knowing I can have a latte lite without having to carry it on the subway."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2016-10-07,1.0,"Service sucks here!!!! I didn't know how to use the coupon for $1.99 medium iced latte on the app since the code didn't show. I asked the staff, and he was rude and said ""you figure out how to use, I don's know."" and then he just ignored me, and then I had to stand there and played with the app. What's worse was that the Iced Latte I got tasted awful. Not recommend at all!!!!"
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2015-01-27,2.0,"Donuts are pretty good; however, if you're ordering 12, buy 2 half dozens instead of 1 dozen. In an unusual practice that defy principle of bulk purchasing,half dozen donuts are priced $3.99 whereas dozen is $10.99."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2013-08-18,1.0,The worst dd I have ever been to. Unfriendly staff that can barely be understood when they speak English .
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2012-10-31,4.0,"This Dunkin Donuts is very conveniently located (right when you come out of the 53rd/Lex subway station on the E/M line end) and the staff are generally pretty friendly and efficient with orders.  Barring the occasional communication issue or order mix-up, I've always had a positive experience here.  

When I stop by, it's usually in the morning before work.  It can be a bit of a hectic scene considering it's Midtown at rush hour.  There are times where I'm not really sure who's taking care of my order and what end of the bar it's coming out of, but in the end it always seems to work out."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2011-03-03,5.0,"Sweet!  So happy to find a D&D near work.  It got a grade ""A"" on a recent inspection and they display it proudly in the window.  

It's so convenient at the SE corner entrance of the 53rd & 3rd Ave M,E subway stop."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2014-04-08,5.0,"Love the latte.  They usually have my latte waiting by the time I get to the register.  Apis, one of the workers is adorable and very proficient."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2011-07-21,4.0,"I'm a HUGE DD Addict.  I just wish the product and customer service was more uniform throughout.  There are good and bad DD's beware, but once you find a good one that knows how to make a proper ice coffee, hold on tight.   DD=World domination. 
With that said, this is one of the good ones.  The guy behind the counter knows my order before I walk through the door and he is always fast and nice, mandatory for a 630 arrival time!"
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2013-08-07,1.0,"Apparently, Dunkin Donuts doesn't think that croissants should cone with jam, as their cash register is programmed to charge for a tiny grape jelly packet, the kind that comes free in most coffee shops. The female cashiers wanted to charge me $1.00 extra for grape jelly. Ruined my coffee arguing with me. The other people on line couldn't believe how they were nickel and diming. You got to wonder how they scimp on quality to have to resort to this level. Worse was the rude attitude of staff that could hardly speak English. Bathroom at location was filthy, too.You won't catch me there again!"
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2011-03-06,4.0,"You can't go wrong with Dunkin Donuts. It's pretty much what you'd expect and this one is good and moving the lines along quickly. My only issue is that when I buy a donut (.99) and pay for it with a dollar, they don't give me my penny back.  I don't really want the penny, but at least ask. If they do that with everyone, they must be making a nice little stash of extra money."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2013-04-12,1.0,"I love DD, but this one sucks. They put so little care in anything they serve you. I don't understand why someone is unable to but a bagel with a bagel properly, or why when you order an egg and cheese wrap they cant fold it down the middle. The staff is so careless."
1141,dunkin-new-york-10,2011-08-26,5.0,"I usually come to this place after school and after a month of coming here regularly, they know what I want! I just tell them if I want a medium or a small and the workers know! One time one of the male workers even gave me a few munchkins. :) Everyone who works there is really nice, no matter how busy it is. It's much better than the nearby Lexington Ave one."

1146,kaffe-a-kaffe-new-york-2,2019-09-29,5.0,"*Cold Brew Review* I drink A LOT of cold brew.  At least two a day:  I even brew my own at home.  Trust me when I tell you this is the best cold brew I have had.  With a splash of almond milk it tasted like I was drinking a coffee milkshake:  smooth and divine.  I'm staying right around the corner and I have been back twice a day every day for a fresh iced cup.  

Everyone behind the counter is amazingly sweet and welcoming too.  They remember you and treat you very special.  Get your java here!"

I will definitely be back for my afternoon coffee break.

I went around 2:30pm."
1146,kaffe-a-kaffe-new-york-2,2019-08-14,1.0,"Terrible!! I do not recommend anyone come here ever!! 

Extremely slow service, and neither guy who was in there seemed to know what he was doing. I ordered a large iced mocha (which was about 16oz). 
He asked if I wanted room for milk? Sorry it's supposed to be 90% milk.
Drink was made with powdered unsweetened mocha which was not mixed into the drink and sat, unsaturated on the bottom. It was drinkable with a sugar packet and a lot of mixing but not great. 

I also got a piece of Oreo chocolate cake, unfortunately. I can't tell you how long it's been in that case, but it's AT LEAST a week old. It was hard and completely flavorless I took two bites, and threw it in the trash. It was inedible. 

Somehow my drink and a piece of cake came out to $15 and change. Those prices are criminal for the quality of the product.
They also have a ton of seating but didn't ask me if I wanted it to stay or go and had already bagged everything up so I took it out. Probably for the best because I don't even know what I would have said it they asked me how it was. 
Also, one employee called me ""babe"" on the way out. Yuck.

Truly do not waste your money."

1146,kaffe-a-kaffe-new-york-2,2020-02-05,1.0,I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone. They will over charger you on based on how you look. Specially if you're a tourist. Be careful of this place.
1146,kaffe-a-kaffe-new-york-2,2019-06-24,2.0,I had to pay 8 dollars for a small iced americano. That is coffee price and tax plus credit card fee.
1151,starbucks-new-york-315,2020-05-25,4.0,"Stopped by yesterday morning to pick up my order made through my app and a lovely barista greeted us at the door to open it for us. I will definitely say, Starbucks has stepped up their game when it comes to protecting the general public and its employees. The barista in the front of the entrance was at a makeshift cash register in the front so that we're not at the usual registers in the front and they bring everything to us providing us from touching anything. Sanitized products were visible to ease any anxiety or suspicions one may have. Everyone in the store was very nice and alert. It was almost a sense of normality in a way, but I appreciated their attitude during these difficult times, and my order came out perfect."
1151,starbucks-new-york-315,2019-10-01,3.0,"They're definitely a step up from the location that closed down on 60th and Broadway. 

They do tend to get very busy now that they're the closest location to NYIT and other college campuses but they usually get the orders right and in a timely fashion. 

I've had a few hiccups with them over mobile orders but they usually resolve them quickly and efficiently (""usually"" being the key word).

It goes without saying that you have a much better experience when you come earlier in the morning before the work/school rush. It seems like it's a closer walk from the Columbus Circle train station so I'll primarily come here versus the other store on 59th & Columbus."

They forgot that I ordered it, because they were out of stock, then they switched my drink order to a strawberry dragonfruit drink, then they made one and gave it to another customer and THEN they spelled my name wrong. They were also hella rude. I am upset and saddened by this situation and hope that that these injustices can be corrected."

I waited received part of my order and as she helped another customer she noticed I was still waiting and asked me what happened and if she could help me. I explained I was missing part of my order and she rushed to her register and attended to me quickly and efficiently. She went above and beyond and gave me awesome customer service and care.  Thank you Emily for string my day off with a great smile and care. I will be sure to pass it on.

Employees did give her a another coffee, but they did not help her clean up the mess. Other customers did. Please, make better cups to prevent this from happening to other customers or put a ""warning, this cup may randomly break open all over your nice clothes"". This is NYC.

Gave up on Sbux mobile ordering because of this store. 9x out of 10 my drink would never show up and I'd have to flag down a disinterested barista to try to get it made before I was late for work. I often instead just left rather than hassle with the staff (some of whom seem to be a lot more interested in fooling around with each other rather than actually, you know, keeping the really long lines moving).

But, it is called an Almond Croissant. So the good is that there is a nice amount of almond filling-nice, AND, the sliced almonds on top are plentiful-lovely, BUT, the ""croissant "" itself is NOT A FLAKY, layered croissant AND THAT is the Major Downer about this croissant. It should not be called a ""croissant""!!!!  That's the story here folks. And, sitting at a table by the 2nd door, you get the COLD AIR coming right in, so sometimes I put my down hood up. I'm having Pike Place Hot Coffee with my , sorry SBUX, my fake croissant.  On a happier note, I DO LIKE THE CHOCOLATE CROISSANT SBUX SERVES & Warms.  So, that's my 2cents worth. Enjoy! I'm still a Starbucks fan. Photo of almond croissant for you to see-I'm posting it just for you:)

Around the hour of 9am to 10:30am, I salute the staff, but I wish there wasn't as much outright yelling behind the counter, HOWEVER, I guess if that is what you need to do to get the orders right, then, I guess ok. Again, I truly salute ALL the baristas...you deal with a lot...""wet, dry, short, extra, blah, blah--you do rock!"

1151,starbucks-new-york-315,2017-10-18,3.0,"So I come here everyday maybe even twice a day. It's convenient on the way to class - 1 star for that . I always get a venti pumpkin spice (depending on the season ) with 4 shots and almond milk. I always get the egg white bites and everything is good besides the long line but they make it quick and get my coffee right almost all the time - 1 star for that(other places always forget to use almond milk I'm super lactose intolerant) ANYWAYS when I get the egg bites it comes in a little cardboard tray and fork and knife. It's not a pastry you can't just dump in the the bag because well... EGG? Anyways today I burnt my thumb grabbing the bag from them to put it in my bag cause they made it so hot and the person who heated up my egg bites took it OUT of the tray with no fork it does actually get quite messy without utensils ( my lazy butt tried just picking it up and stuffing it in my mouth ). Ehhh. 
I complained about the rude manager before but she really improved . She doesn't yell and she isn't visibly impatient with her coworkers - which no one wants to hear at like 8 in the morning. The manager is actually quite pleasant so 1 star for that also."

Two employees were working the cash registers but it seemed like one of the cashiers was training someone, so she was a bit slower than a usual Sbux cashier (ya, I get it, gotta train new employees!). I didn't have to wait all that long for my drink either, though I did wistfully eye an already prepped drink on the mobile order counter. Wanna bypass the line and the wait? Do that. 

Even by 7:15am, a lot of the seating at this location was already snagged. I probably could have found somewhere to chill had I wanted to stay, but I don't expect this location will be one to give you that ""half-empty coffee shop"" relaxing yet productive vibe. No matter to me, I'll just duck in, grab my drink, and duck out, thank you very much."

I was in line with my dad and we couldn't here one of the employees calling us to her cash register. As it is the place was loud and my dad was pulling up his starbucks card. We finally realised that there was an open register but then the person behind the counter decided to start scolding us that we ""weren't paying attention"". I found this very disrespectful."

There is limited seating; therefore, I was stuck sitting by the front window on a bench with these odd round stools. There could definitely be a different seating arrangement in that area. Since it was raining, the bench was soaking wet and there was limited space.

A girl came up to the pick-up counter to ask about part of her mobile order that she hadn't been given, and the manager was very rude to her, telling her that they didn't have any orders under that name and that there's ""no way"" they would've accepted the order because they didn't have any chocolate croissants in stock. While I was waiting around for my drink - which took over fifteen minutes to make btw- I saw that the girl's order sticker was on the other counter, and it did include the chocolate croissant. One of the baristas did eventually get the girl her croissant (spoiler alert: it actually was in stock).  Shame on the manager for having such a bad attitude towards this young girl over such a small thing."
1151,starbucks-new-york-315,2013-10-18,3.0,"Good sized location with one of the best line layouts I've seen. I only mention this because so many Starbucks have such awkward lines. It's like the store designers forget about where people were supposed to stand entirely. 

 Very busy. Tons of seating, with a high proportion of it near outlets. 

Only thing that's not cool is the nook on the right. So many plugs. So much seating right by the window for people watching... but such crap wi-fi reception, just in that  neat little corner. C'est la vie.

I would have given this location 4 stars but for the music. Why is it so obnoxiously loud?  With the Muzak set to P-Funk tonight, I expected a dance party to break out and cocktail service due to the volume alone. People had to shout over it in order to be heard. Thank God I always carry noise canceling headphones with me."

There is a coffee shop downstairs in the whole foods at the time Warner center at Columbus circle or the Sensuous Bean a little farther north on Columbus.

Seriously. I would give one star if I could for the worst coffee ever.

The restroom made me gag. Repulsive- urine everywhere, toilet paper strips spewed all over the room, rancid smell. 

I ordered a green tea latte and waited 10 minutes. Then they told me they don't have the right powder to make it. They tried to offer me a regular green tea (2$) in place of my 6$ latte. I asked for a refund. They were rude while processing the refund. 

If this ever happened in Seattle they would at least be friendly and offer a free drink card."

1151,starbucks-new-york-315,2014-10-30,1.0,"I was so amused by how badly this place is running. I go to Starbucks daily. Sometimes more than once. This place is a horror show for anyone that appreciates coffee. We entered and hip hop music was blasting. That's a Starbucks first..... And that's not even an issue for me. 

We ordered two clover coffees. I've seen the process done so many times that I am familiar with the proper way to make one. The barista didn't weigh the beans like they normally do. He just guesstimated an amount that he poured into the grinder. He also violently whipped the water with the grinds to the point that it was splashing everywhere. It's only supposed to be gently folded over a few times. I could tell by the way the grinds looked after that he used way too many beans. Deviating from procedure resulted in not good coffee. A clover brew is supposed to be ""the best cup you'll ever have"" and is priced accordingly. It was not drinkable. 

I was amused and wondered if the barista was not trained properly or just didn't care at all.  I had my answer when I saw him pour and steam dairy milk in the frothing pitcher labeled ""soy.""

I left bewildered. Why is this place running so poorly?"

AM employees please come to work. 
It's a coffee shop."
1151,starbucks-new-york-315,2016-01-20,2.0,Came here for a cup of coffee during my lunch break. This place gets really crowded with high school kids. Most of them just hanging out filling up space. Staff is unfriendly with a splash of attitude. Must be a requirement in the city. I only came to this location because it was one block away from my client's office. Good coffee tho!
1151,starbucks-new-york-315,2014-12-06,1.0,"Avoid this location! Never any seats. Popular only because of the convenient location despite the sub-par service and lack of products. Service here is terrible! It took 25 minutes to get my drink EVEN after I surmised that there would be an issue and double checked with them. This location is one of the only ones that automates the ordering system. SO WHEN THE CASHIER TYPES IN THE WRONG DRINK, YOU'LL GET THE WRONG DRINK! (My cashier seemed unfamiliar with the system and opted to charge me for the drink closest to what he can find on the register.)

WRONG PRODUCTS: After 3 years, this is one of the remaining places that still hasn't trained their workers that a ""skinny mocha"" is not the same as a ""skim mocha""! Because I drink Starbucks EVERY day for last 10 years and last 3 because of the lower calorie mocha drink, I learned to always check what comes up at the register to see whether they get the order right. This guy rang it up as a mocha. I told him that it's a ""skinny mocha"" at which point, he repeatedly demanded ""what do YOU mean by a skinny mocha"" even after I said that it's not the same as a non-fat mocha. How can I answer differently? You're Starbucks! You named the drink a ""Skinny mocha"" then took 2 years to explain what it is to your own people, and your employees still default to a non-fat mocha when requested unbeknownst to your own customers. 

Interestingly, I notice that that mistake only happens whenever the store didn't bother making and thus, can't offer a skinny mocha! At this point, all the cashiers inevitably nod and charge me for a non-fat mocha. You can't assume a non-fat mocha will be my choice to substitute for a skinny mocha. A skinny vanilla latte offers a similar 130 calorie count AND sugar free vs. a non-fat mocha's 340 calories. 

Starbucks had 3 years to train it's employees on the difference. It takes 20 sec to ask for customers substitute preference. 

BAD SERVICE: Worse yet, I don't need a cashier who is passive aggressively defensive about it. This is the first instance when I've asked for clarification and got back that it's my fault for asking for asking for ""skim"". You couldn't have heard ""skim"" from a repeated 2 syllable word ""skinny"" during our long discussion about which drink I meant. Also, unless I have amnesia, you can't tell me that you're glad you helped me find the mistake! And if I correct you about that, it's super passive aggressive to argue and then, immediately fake apologize like you're patronizing a bully when you see the other cashier listening.

LONG WAIT: I told the cashier that since the order at this location is automated by what's rung up at the register and he still typed in skinny vanilla latte wrong, I don't think I would get my drink. He assured me that the order is there and that the order ticket just didn't print yet. Why would the order ticket not come up yet after 6 customers' orders have been taken after me?

So I wait and wait till 2x the long line had gotten their drinks. I asked for my drink status and the irritated barista tells me that it's coming. When he frees up to check the 2 outstanding drink orders, he whispers to the lady barista to make my drink for me. The cashier noticing that I'm the ONLY person still waiting now, checks with her. She says that they have my drink order (only because the other barista told her to make it). I get my drink and it was wrong again. They made me a tall drink. Then, they had to remake it again. The guy barista said a quick sorry but refused to even look up when I told him that it had been 25 minutes. 

POOR TRAINING & POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, STARBUCKS!!!"
1151,starbucks-new-york-315,2011-09-07,1.0,"Always very busy, always a long line. No matter how many people they throw at the crowd, it seems like I'm always waiting 10-15 minutes to get a drink. Granted, it's a very central location, but if that's the case, then staff your shop accordingly; if you know you're going to be packed everyday, bring in another few workers.

I also have to say, the bathroom here is one of the most disgusting I've ever seen in any public establishment, and I've been to some pretty nasty 3rd world hellholes. Mystery liquid everywhere, insects buzzing around, toilet paper all over the floor, and a stench that can only be described as rotting troll carcass combined with fresh feces. 

It's better to get your coffee at another branch. And if you absolutely must use the bathroom, you may seriously want to considering pissing yourself. It may be more pleasant."

This is a full service Starbucks so they have everything as far as food, pastries, pre packaged stuff, bottle drinks, etc. The store is set up long way so you just keep moving towards the back once you ordered, to grab your drink. There are some seats to the left against the wall and there are more seats in the back of the store. A few counter seats as well. There always seems to be a line at the bathroom.

Why the 4 stars:
1) this is one of the very few places which calibrated the right amount of coffee ratio for my Latte.  That is two extra stars from others 
2) general area - floor and tables were constantly cleaned up

Really like this Starbucks location just a block away from the Rockefeller Center.  Came here at 8am during the weekend and it was super quiet with a very short line. 

There were 3 baristas when I visited. They were very kind and friendly. Inside, the ambience was subtle. Ended up getting a cappuccino, lemon cake and sandwich. Parking can be an issue for this particular location. Not much else to say about a typical Starbucks in a great tourist hub! 

The convenience of having a Starbucks at this very location is probably the best thing any coffee lover perusing around the Rockefeller site can ask for. Sure there's a bunch of Starbucks' everywhere, but where will you find one close to the ice skating rink and the Nintendo Store."

The only problem I have is with how they make their matcha. It is always clumpy and I can't stand to drink clumps to powder. They should be receiving 4 stars, but I make matcha myself and know there's different techniques for prep, so they might be using one I'm not aware of. It's nothing I can't fix myself by swirling it in the cup."

1155,starbucks-new-york-504,2017-08-22,2.0,"Good amount of seating and outlets, chill ambiance, and two clean bathrooms, but why does it always take 20-30 min to get a simple drink, even during off-peak hours?"
1155,starbucks-new-york-504,2019-03-11,1.0,"I am not really a coffee drinker so that I even go to Starbucks is huge. Add to that the fact that I already have major problems with the way the company does its business, the idea that I've even attempted to patronize this business after last summer's events is remarkable. That's being said, this location is the worst location I have ever been too. They are inefficient at best and incompetent at worst. I went in this morning and ordered. There were only a few people ahead of me. How it is possible that I waited almost 20 minutes for a skinny vanilla latte is beyond me. It is likely I would still be standing there had I not asked for it. It was hastily and incorrectly prepared and basically tossed at me after I asked for a refund. This is not the first time this month this has happened. It is especially alarming that I have only seen them behave this way toward people of color; people of color are often left waiting for inordinate amounts of time like our time is not precious. It's even more saddening that the staff at this location is mostly minority. Is veiled discrimination something they teach in Starbucks U?"
1155,starbucks-new-york-504,2018-05-10,2.0,Worse location ever. Waiting time is around 20 min to get your coffee drink.  Extremely slow and unfriendly personal. I like Starbucks but trying to avoid this location.

The tables and chairs are very dirty
The restroom is disgusting 
The garbage is full so people through away the garbage at the table.
Never to see Starbucks store like this one. So ashamed is a beautiful place just luck management I guess."

I don't expect much good customer service in Manhattan but this Starbucks is worst I've come across. Not even deserving one star. The staff are so rude.

1155,starbucks-new-york-504,2017-12-10,1.0,"Worst Starbucks I've been too ever and go to them all over the place.  Dirty tables for over 30 minutes.  Rude employees, not one, all of them.  Ran out of peppermint but let my wife wait for 15 minutes till she asked where was her drink.   Just let it sit there.  #NeedNewManagement."
1155,starbucks-new-york-504,2017-05-26,1.0,"I had a bad experience at this location. First, the person cleaning the floors prepared my food, with no gloves on. Then he dropped it and tried to give it to me. I refused and the cashier became very angry and took a food item out of the display case to warm it up, instead of getting a sealed one. Then my drink order was wrong. I had to go back up to the barista to have it fixed. During this whole time the employees were busy making jokes and playing around, the barista even put an ice cube down the cashier's shirt! This is the worse Starbucks that I have ever been to. Disgusting! I complained and did receive a credit, but I wrote back and told them that the hygiene issues are serious and they have to be taken seriously!"
1155,starbucks-new-york-504,2017-08-26,1.0,Rude barista...thought he was funny mispronouncing my name and shouting it loudly in a nasal voice! And didn't warm up my croissant and messed up my daughter's cake pop...seriously asked for pink one...looked like wasn't even listening!
1155,starbucks-new-york-504,2017-08-15,2.0,"How do they only have one barista working midday? Got stuck behind two groups of tourists, took ten minutes to order,  then had to scrounge for what looks like a lot of space but is in fact limited in terms of seating.  I know this is a heavy tourist area, but even so it seemed more cramped than the space under 30 Rock."
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2020-02-25,4.0,Service is okay but there are always seats. Definitely mobile order because it's slow sometimes. The bag hooks under neath the tables are great for saving space.
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2020-01-08,3.0,"This is one of the smaller Starbucks around but the line moves quickly! It is smart that they ask if anyone is just getting coffee so that those people
could get their orders processed quickly! I love the curves bar here- welcomes solo diners and it is a warm feeling that it exudes. I like the sayings around this store. A positive experience."
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2019-11-22,1.0,"Worst customer service or guest experience ever. Was so embarrassed. Had to ask 3 times for toilet paper in either other restrooms and one of the workers gave me the biggest sass. Y'all sell stimulants all damn day and don't expect people not to use the toilet? How dare you. The female worker yelled to the rest of the staff as customers over heard ""HA he gotta go real bad!!!!"" 5 minutes later she hands me ONE SINGLE ROLL of TP. Are you kidding me? So now many other customers have to experience the same ridicule??? Who the hell trained these people???

NEVER have I been more embarrassed in my life!!! Will be boycotting all Starbucks locations from here on out!"
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2019-12-08,4.0,"One of the larger Starbucks where you can get some studying done. Never had a problem with any of the baristas. They get my drink right the majority of the time. Bathroom could use a little work, can be really dirty sometimes. I wish they cleaned it more frequently. Besides that, this is my go-to Starbucks and I love coming here when I need to get work done."
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2019-09-19,1.0,"Horrible service , waited 15 minutes and the 3 people behind the counter don't realize you have ordered and are waiting."
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2019-05-08,1.0,"Service is just the worst. Customers waiting in line, but no one deigns to come take your order...until they are done doing whatever it is they are doing. Don't even ask you your name, unless you are a regular. Once I waited for my drink for over 5 minutes on a fairly empty afternoon only to find that it has been sitting on the counter. No calling. I give one star for the seating, you can usually get a seat without waiting. Otherwise, go elsewhere."
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2017-02-05,5.0,Came on a Sunday at 2pm. Everything was clean and in good condition. Bathrooms (2) were exceptionally clean with no line. Only 5 patrons were sitting - the high top tables have outlets which is super convenient. I tried the new Cascara latte - it was delicious. Would highly recommend coming here to do work - it's not as chaotic as other Starbucks closer to Lexington
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2018-02-05,1.0,"Absolutely the worst Starbucks I have ever experienced, which is a shame because it's the one closest to where I live. Out of the 6 times I've tried going there, they got my order correct once (but not really since they didn't have the almond milk I requested and already paid extra for). 

One time they completely forgot about my order for 20 minutes until I went back up to the counter to ask about it (at which point I said forget it and asked for a refund); one time I waited on line for six minutes with three people ahead of me and I left because the line had not moved; and THREE times I left with my drink only to discover it was not the drink I ordered. I have also seen other customers go back up to the counter complaining about their drinks not being right. 

On top of all this, the store is not very clean. I've witnessed someone spill their drink at the pickup counter and the employees were right there and did not notice...when someone pointed it out to them they mopped and returned right to making drinks. So gross."
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2017-02-23,4.0,"Nice new location! It's large and clean. More seating than the location on 50th and 2nd.

1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2017-09-14,1.0,This Starbucks has the worst baristas in the history of Starbucks that I've been too.  They area where you pickup your drinks and the behind area were  super dirty and wet. Not only was the area wet and dirty the cup was suppppppperr wet and nasty when she handed it to me. They didn't care about presentation and were more worried about fixing the drink of their friends that come to visit them as they worked.
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2018-05-11,1.0,"I have gone to the Starbucks multiple times.  I'm always hoping that maybe this time they'll be efficient, friendly, or get my order correct.   They have never done even one of these things.   Avoid this one.  
The only positive comment I can make is that there is more seating compared to other nearby Starbucks."
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2018-09-01,1.0,"This Starbucks location gets one star for its seating but NOTHING else. The employees decide when they want to brew a certain roast and it's filthy inside. Maybe if the employees spent less time on their cell phones and more time working, customers would leave here disgusted! What a wasted location. These employees are getting away with getting for nothing!"
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2017-04-24,1.0,"As others have noted, this started as a new, clean spacious, comfortable, quiet, absolutely 5*   Starbucks.  Then, I guess, the Assistant Junior Area Manager in charge of Mediocrity wandered in, saw that people were working and having quiet conversations and announced - this is NOT the way we do things at Starbucks!  He immediately ordered the manager to play screaming, pounding music and crank up the volume until this sounded like any other New York City Starbucks - ie - the nearest subway station with a train coming in. 

So 5* for the Starbucks but 1* for the incompetent, uncaring, bottom-seeking, tone deaf local management who should really be replaced by people with ability and taste."
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2017-06-02,4.0,Quick service and friendly baristas. The drinks are prepared well and quickly.  I don't stop in often but I'm pleased when I do.
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2017-04-10,5.0,"This spot is new. Used to be a McDonald's. Very clean. Employees are friendly.
Also they have a drink that is not at any other Starbucks locations: MaChai. It's a matcha based tea drink. I don't usually like tea, but this was amazing. All them for a sample."
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2017-02-15,5.0,"This is my favorite Starbucks in Manhattan right now. It's clean, the staff are super friendly, and they always make my drink correctly, no matter what I order. Seating is also perfect if you need to get work done-- They have high top tables, a communal table, and stools along the bar. It's a great space. A lot easier to focus here than at 53rd and Lexington, but that one is probably more accommodating for meetings. This location is not very social."
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2017-03-12,5.0,"I ordered breakfast (on the way into work) this morning (a Sunday morning) and when I arrived, it was waiting for me, all bagged, and perfectly packaged, and I was warmly greeted by the very nice lady working (around 6:20am).  Such a nice start to the day.  I otherwise stop in every now and then for mobile orders and they're always perfectly done--much better than other locations.  Thanks, Starbucks!"
1164,starbucks-new-york-501,2017-02-08,4.0,"finally a place i can  waste some time on a sunday morning or when i dont feel like going to work while football season is not around. for years this location on 1st ave between 53rd and 54th st was home to mcdonald's for many years until it shut down more then a year ago and it was a smart move by starbucks to open a chain in the area.the new look funky decor is a welcome sight in this spacious bucky .plenty of seating inside with sofas , high top tables with stools, lounge chairs , etc and many outlets to charge up and use the free wifi. the giant pics on the walls along with the exposed bricks and dim lighting makes this a place where you can grab a hot or cold beverage or maybe some pastries or some other food items and just chill out. the staff are friendly and i hope it stays that way but i must give them major credit cause the place is clean and organized especially the glass counter with the assorted sweets displayed neatly . a nice addition to the area compared to mcdonald's of the past , better type of people inside and i dont have to see the bums anymore who would hang inside all day and stink up the place . thank you starbucks for setting shop here  and your blueberry scones are yummy . 4.stars on my yelp meter ."

1165,mcdonalds-new-york-144,2020-04-03,3.0,with whats going on nationwide i have been working mostly from home but a few times i had to run to the office and with very few food options i can count on mcdonalds for a quick snack. the location is 47th st off madison ave and with only takeout which is great cause i dont have to deal with crowds or rude tourist. they have the self service ordering kiosk so i dont have to stand via the 6 feet apart rule and give my order to  a 18 year old mcdonald worker who looks scared cause i have a l.a rams bandana covering my beautiful face. 2 apple pies and a medium diet coke is good enough as i dont want to eat too much fast food during the stay home period which i assume will last a while . thank you mcdonalds for being open for takeout only during the  pandemic and please  stay safe and in the words of the late great bill withers   lean on me when your not strong.
1165,mcdonalds-new-york-144,2019-12-04,2.0,"Popped in here, half the self-order kiosks were down, and so I ended up going to order from the front. The person calling out the orders had a strong accent, many of the orders ahead of me weren't certain which number she called out, so a little more confusion than needed, I think.

They have the Coke machines that are fancier and let you choose via  touchscreen, but they don't have sweet or unsweet tea out to get ourself (behind the counter). They do ascribe to the $1 any size soda/tea deal, though.  

Seating was a mix of some tables needing cleaning and others that were spotless."
1165,mcdonalds-new-york-144,2019-08-22,2.0,"Gross in here. 

I had to use the bathroom when I was dining here and there was someone doing drugs in the bathroom and there was a big commotion about the whole ordeal. Be aware of this type of stuff at this location. 

The service is lackluster, they have gotten my order wrong quite a few times and always seem reluctant to correct it. 

I'm not expecting Michelin star service here, but I wouldn't even say this location has standard service. 

Not good, eat elsewhere. 
2/5"

When did the McChicken become $2.50? Only way to get meal deal is if you have the app and use those coupons. 

If you're not satisfied with the amount of fries they give you, you can complain and they'll fill it up more."

I see a employee in the dining room and ask her if she can please get me ketchup she replies with ""you can get up and go get it yourself"" my face dropped as to how rude can you be.

As I was leaving I run to the bathroom to wash my hands. A male employee comes into the bathroom he relieves himself in the urinal and walks out without washing his hands. All I can take away from my experience today was rude and disgusting employees."
1165,mcdonalds-new-york-144,2019-01-08,4.0,Service is fast here and staff is nice. The kiosk machines is user-friendly and let's us order quickly. One downside is the seats and tables are not cleaned often enough. Food ordered here is just as expected and I haven't had a bad experience.

That is the all that you need to know about this McD.

I walked into it during the breakfast rush hour.

The place was near empty, with only a few obvious tourist types sitting.

They messed up my order, which is pretty normal for McD. Had to make them get the correct order.

The Bacon Egg and Cheese Bagel looked and tasted stale.

The coffee was watery. 


The rest room was dirty.

They really need to get their act together"
1165,mcdonalds-new-york-144,2017-09-22,3.0,"24 hour location so the zombies like to claim the booths by the wall. It's not a terribly dirty McDonald's however and the fries are fresh at night. However, there's a sign claiming enforcement of loitering rules limited to 30min seating every 3 hours. Wow, so specific but clearly a false claim because no one was moving but they don't bother you. Also, cashiers are often very friendly, where have you heard that before?

It's off 5th Avenue on 47th street so the crowd isn't like other locations on main avenues. Weekday lunch hour is the only time I've seen it packed."

While I was waiting, the employee mopping in the waiting area was literally pushing me with the end of her stick.  It took 5 minutes to get ready and when it arrived I asked for it to-go.  The employee behind the counter motioned to the plastic bags by the napkins and said that I can get it.  I preferred a brown paper bag and 3-4 employees looked at each other dumbfounded.  It took another 2 minutes.  I give up McDonald's, unless it's 4am and I'm trashed and in need for a mcgriddle."

I'm sorry the manager has to work with such employees. The food is okay mostly. The hygiene in the kitchen is okay but on the outside, more work needs to be done. I don't blame them because there's a bar right next to them so people puke around them all the time. I also never eat there so I can say I have the right not to care.

I walk over & also needed to use the rest room & what do i see, chairs & boxes infront of the area where the bathroom is. Big surprise the bathroom isnt working. Last time I was here it was April & guess what, no bathroom then either. I did ask if they have a restroom I can use since I have a bladder issue & before I got my drink I wanted to go & they told me no they dont have one.

This baristas name was Michelle & she turned around to another spanish girl & made a comment in SPANISH about my white friends ""picky order"". I didn't say anything at the moment because I wanted to see how disrespectful they would get. & in fact the disrespect was terrible because then it became a conversation amongst the other workers. They were just all laughing & making dumb jokes. So disrespectful, terrible customer service! This happened today at around 8am. 

I hope the manager teaches this girl some better manners & discretion! If she doesn't like people being picky about their coffee then she should find herself a new job!"

 Favorites: Turkey Pesto on Focaccia. Of course the Beechers Grilled Cheese. And between the chorizo/egg or the spinach feta wrap, you can't go wrong. 

As my posts may give it away,  some of my favorites (drinks):
Hot Green Tea Latte, pretty much all of the Shaken Iced Teavana teas,  and the Flat White.

Ordering ahead on the app was a huge mistake, because they stage the orders in a place that's hard to reach, and they just leave them there (if they remember to fill them at all). Trying to get help from the staff is a challenge, to say the least. They seem like nice people, but they can't keep up with the workload.  Avoid."

I was having lunch with my coworkers at a location 10 mins away from this Starbucks, so I decided to try ordering my drink via the Starbucks app. I didn't know what to expect but it was cool how it gives you updates on when your drink should be ready and even gives you directions on how to get to the Starbucks you're ordering from. You can also customize the drink to your liking. For example, I changed the milk option to soy and I asked for light ice. 

Another neat thing is how the app pinpoints all the Starbucks locations nearby on a map so you can decide which one to order your drink from. Test it out! My drink was ready by the time I walked the 10 mins from the restaurant to Starbucks."
1172,starbucks-new-york-224,2016-07-22,1.0,"I waited half an hour (possibly even more) for water. When I tried ordering a drink that wasn't water, these two guys kept talking. I waved... I smiled, ""yes hi, I'm here...""-- and they kept talking. I waited another five minutes (I'm not joking) and finally, I tell them, ""just a water""-- and it took forever.

Freaking forever. 

And on top of that, there were barely any customers.
One customer was also waiting for water.

The customer before me received water in grande cups. I guess the jerk attending me noticed I was mad and decided to get me madder? So he gave me a tall cup of water, 80% filled with ice.

I'm done with you, starbucks.

It's too hot to deal with this.
Zero stars for you."

Cashiers and baristas all have terrible attitudes, I was literally surprised when a person smiled at me once. I also remember the one time I waited 20min for a drink that never came. Rather than weave through the hoard of people crowded around the bar, it was better to just walk out. 

Avoid if you can, unless you require desperate caffeine fixes on work days and this is the most convenient choice."

Somebody tell me how I order a toasted bagel with butter around 8a.m. with about 2 people ahead of me but am waiting damn near 10 minutes for it...mind you didn't order anything to drink because I do not drink coffee but still managed to wait damn near 10 minutes. Incompetence is what it is pretty much. I give a pass here and there if a worker is having a bad day or the place is just overly crowded but neither was the case here. Messing up or taking long with something as simple as a toasted bagel with butter is like messing up with something as simple as an order of fries...it's something that just shouldn't happen and shouldn't be accepted. I was better off going to the Starbucks that is right on the block of the train station where I get off for work. 

Guessing I should only go to this Starbucks now during my break at work or after work but then I am guessing that would be risking coming back late from my break or getting home later than I usually do. Smdh"

Also i remember i came on a Saturday morning and i seen two workers go in their employee bathroom together for over 30 minutes.

The lines are average for midtown but they are very unorganized. I only get drips because waiting for a prepared drink takes way too long at this location.

I recently tried there green tea mixed with peach lemonade... The flavors aren't what I wanted to be...Starbucks might use loose leaf tea to make their tea...Loose leaf tea always has more flavor then tea bags... Ask your barista if they use leaf or tea bags...

There's a few areas for you to sit and enjoy your beverages ...the seats are all funky and werid... Some chairs are too high... Then there's this long sofa couch...what's that about?"

I've been to this Starbucks mostly because it's just across where I study so location-wise it's the most convenient. 

however, I just have to give this one max score because recently (Oct 2019) I visited this place and I think they renewed the staffs or something because suddenly the service was super top notch. best service I've ever had in any Starbucks in fact. especially the lady at the counter and the dude who called out for order that was ready. incredibly friendly staffs and they are spreading good vibes. literally they made my day brighter before the caffeine hit my system and that's not very common, hence I find it unusual too to give 5 stars to usual chain coffee shop. i don't remember the staffs being that cheerful before so i hope you guys keep up the good vibes"

Maybe I have high standards for customer service because I am in the industry, but the problem hasn't been mentioned yet. I ordered a tall cap and a pumpkin bread, they call out the cap (no name) and I mention to the girl that I am still waiting for a pumpkin bread. She rolls her eyes, says ok.. with some hood attitude.. and walks over to get it. Brings it, I say thank you very much.. she ignores it . . So I tell her to try and have a good day and smile . . She goes ""I WAS having a good day"".. now I'm sorry . . Idk what hood you come from where it's ok to talk to people like they owe you something, but that's your job. If you don't like it maybe you should go work somewhere else, where you don't deal w people .  I hear McDonald's pays $15 /hr for you to do the same amount of work and have the same crappy attitude !

I've had at least two horrible experiences here involving the same woman. She is incredibly rude and often snaps at you. Unfortunately, her rudeness is rubbing off on the other workers. They follow her same, rude example by snapping at customers, and making them yell their orders over those in front of the line (and when you try to move closer so you don't have to yell over the person paying, they yell at you to get back in line). She even had the audacity yesterday to bark at all of us waiting for a drink asking what we all had ordered. Um, don't you have my cup right there with my order? Yes, yes you do. You looked right at it. I would have been okay with her asking this, as it was beginning to get crowded by the pick up counter (because they are RIDICULOUSLY slow) if her tone wasn't so rude.

Mainly, my complaints are only with two of the women who work there usually in the afternoons. The morning people are wonderful! But if you try to get a coffee anytime in the afternoon, tell your office you'll be back in a half hour because they're SO SLOW, and be prepared to be barked at the entire time you're there."

It's just the service is so so so so so slow! My sister and I were the only ones ordering, no one was ahead of us, no one was behind us. Why on earth were the staff chattering away like there was no tomorrow?! The girl at the cashier took my order, then she turned to chat to her buddy behind the counter with her. I attempt to pay with my phone, but I made a mistake, and I ask her if it went through. She must have a need to finish her conversation, because only during a lull in the convo did she tell me to try again. Then as her buddy is making my drink, she continues her conversation. My sister comes up to the cashier, but it takes an eternity for her to take her order. Why did it take over 20 minutes to put together two simple orders when it's not busy in any way you want to define the term? There's only two of us, and there are two of you!

I end up here a fair amount because I work nearby and I've never seen such self-dramatizing, quick-to-anger rude jerks. 

I've seen them pick fights, talk about customers to each other WHILE THE CUSTOMER IS STANDING THERE, and on one memorable occasion saw an out-of-control barista flip off a customer who was understandably upset at the rude treatment he was getting. 

I think it's a management down problem but it's pervasive and long-running. Unfortunately, it's mainly tourists who are getting the brunt of this horrible treatment."

The staff in this SB are extremely friendly and personable. If you come often enough, they will remember your name and your ""usual"" drink and will actually treat you like a person rather than an order to be filled. That's a real rarity these days. There are three other SB's within a two minute walk from my office and even though they are larger or more quiet, I end up coming to this Starbucks because I feel more ""at home"" here. 

Am I waxing rhapsodic and being overly sentimental? Probably! But I don't care! I just like it here! 

As for the quality of the drinks and food, well, it's standard SB fare, nothing special, but reliable.

From the smiling, chipper guy behind the corner to the whistling worker mopping the bathroom floor, everyone there acted like they just stepped out of a commercial.  It was uncanny.

I sat on a comfy chair in the front corner window and watched the world go by with an iced coffee and a Bukowski novel while waiting for an appointment.  I really don't like Starbucks but there really wasn't anywhere else in the neighborhood to kill an hour, so there you go."

For all the 1 star reviews below, readers need to understand that this one tiiiiiiny location is servicing the entire BNP and UBS buildings for their morning coffee fixes. So yeah, there is going to be a wait in the morning. Order ahead with the app on your way into work if you need to (that's what I do and it's always ready for me when I get there!) 

While a wait is often inconvenient, they still get 5 stars because everyone who works there is incredibly friendly even when the store is packed. You can tell that they are working as fast as they can which also adds to the fact that slack needs to be cut for them. I can understand being angry if there is a huge wait and it seems like the staff is taking their sweet time to do things but that isn't the case here.

SKIP YOUR ORDER + MISSING INGREDIENT/INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY + BAD ATTITUDE 
That nice Friday morning. I'm chilled and kinda happy coz the week gonna end, never imaging that Starbucks could piss me off at the first place.

So I ordered grande mango dragonfruit and patiently waiting. People comes and go, after 10+ minutes I was still there waiting for my drink. The thirsty is real. Seeing me gradually looking anxious and impatient, that name-calling guy Eric just asked what is my drink. Okay and now I know they skipped my order and just started to make it.

Much unfortunately is that they now say they don't have that passion fruit. Lol then why selling it at first place, you should notify your customer. And I said I already waited for like 6 mins and about to late for work. The rude name-calling guy with nothing good just said oh he waited for 6 minutes probably 7. Already that number counting game, so I said or even 8, probably 9. 

I can be defensive when some of rude customer service person trying to ride over me. Showing that attitude at first place ain't professional.

This location is small, crowded and usually has a long line.

I also do not know what is warmer, their coffee or the air. They seriously need to lower the thermostat at this location. I could not wait to get my drink and escape the coffee sauna ASAP."
1174,starbucks-new-york-555,2013-12-15,2.0,Terribly slow. I don't get it. They seem to think it's ok to be understaffed by a barista the majority of the time. Constant screw-ups and missed drinks.
1174,starbucks-new-york-555,2010-03-23,4.0,"I no longer frequent Starbucks as often as I did in my college days. However, they were having this great promotion where you can get one bakery item with the purchase of any drink. Of course, the drink will cost you $5, when a pastry costs $2, but for most, the drink is the usual fare, and the pastry is just the cherry on top.

Fortunately, this Starbucks location is SUPER convenient for me, and I popped in before I started my day, printed out coupon for the free pastry in hand.  The line did take a while, even though there were 3 cashiers taking orders. However, when my turn came, I found out the reason for the delay was because the employees were all really friendly and did not try to rush me, as I asked inane questions, trying to remember what my favorite hot drink was, and how I liked to order it.  

The wait for my drink was also very short, and my marbled pound cake was deliciously moist. The only thing was that there isn't too much standing space, and by the time I left, the line extended to the door. I would definitely come back here because of the wonderful service, especially since summer is right around the corner and I can almost hear the Caramel Frappachinos calling my name."

This was my go-to place for studying and reading for a few years before the newer location on 57th and 10th ave opened up. This location is nice, near Fordham university and just far enough away from the busy Columbus Circle area. Overall a pretty solid starbucks and usually enjoyable.

For sitting and doing work, this location has a decent amount of seating, as well as reasonable amount of outlets. Most of the seating is along the walls and windows, so at times during the day the sun can be glaring and make things difficult to see, or gets pretty hot in the summer. Otherwise there is small assorted seating around the shop as well. Overall it is definitely a very small location.

Size of this location does occasionally lend itself to extremely long lines essentially out the door. The line moves steadily in taking people's orders, but the drink making itself can sometimes lag. Not much space for people to stand in line, or to wait for their drink. Then after you get your drink, you have to wade through all the people who haven't ordered yet to navigate to the exit. There is a single restroom here.

Overall this location is solid. Overall small, but does have some seats to sit and converse or get some work done."

There's always a line and since they're so busy it can take a while to get your order - doesn't matter if you order ahead through the app. Order mixups are not unusual. I recently ordered a mango dragonfruit lemonade on the app but they had run out of all the grapefruit components. Instead of letting me know and offering an alternative, the barista gave me a simple lemonade. When I told her it was not what I ordered she said that it tasted the same and that she knew because she got it all the time. I tried it but it tasted nothing like what I ordered and was probably half the price. 

Save yourself the trouble and time, there's way better Starbucks a few more blocks down."

She then told me to ""scan"" my starbucks card and literally began walking away doing something else(not preparing my drink). The guy making the drinks questioned me what I ordered, after the lady who took my order yelled my order to him. Staff obviously has issues with eachother and lack commuincation skills are strongly evident. The woman taking my order began mumbling and yelling at another employee that was leaving ....

Staff is very disorganzied, rude and unhelpful.

Being a huge fan of starbucks, this starbucks is below average for a typical NYC Starbucks.

If you have the opportunity, go to a different location. If you work at the hospital and its the closest one I guess you must endure the sub par coffe and horrific service that is if your desperate."

Most of them are super friendly which is what gets them up to 3 stars, but I really wish they could get it together and speed it up. Last time I went, there were just a few of us waiting, and my stuff still took forever. And because of how slow they were moving, by the time  I walked out there was a line to the door.

My travels came to a screeching halt to be physically drained and in dire need to be rehydrated.  Starbucks salve my body for a cool down with a good fully functioning air conditioning unit, Tall ice Green Tea at $1.75 and fruit salad deluxe at $3.55 footing the bill at $5.30 (with the infamous abject economic NYC sales tax).

Staff is appears newbies in taking orders as I had to repeat my request three times for one measly small (excuse me, Starbucks' version of ""tall"") ice Green Tea.  Cashier did not request for my name to be inscribed on the cup when picking-up my drink order.  There are ample tables including an island table in the center.  Line appears to be moving moderate at 8:43pm on a Friday night.  One unisex facility exist, but no comment as I did not utilize it."

I don't get this place.  All of the coffee tastes the same - regardless of whether its dark or blonde.  I drink the Blonde roast because its supposed to be ""lighter"" than the dark, but i might as well drink the dark - because they taste the same.

The staff is is SLOW.
It's a starbucks - we're coming to you expecting some kind of efficiency, and yet the line is always out of the door with people waiting, despite 5 people being behind the counter.  Often you can hear employees arguing what they're not going to do.

The preparation bar is almost always empty.  at 8am, i shouldnt have to ask for milk refills.  Again, there's 5 people behind the bar.  The preparation bar is also always a mess.

Nice workers
Good location 
Good coffee. I would always get a Carmel macchiato

Cons:
I went here on a Saturday and notice that the display for their sandwiches and desserts, were a bunch of fruit flies swarming around the food. I lost my appetite after seeing that. And when I got my coffee I notice on the walls there were fruit flies . I don't know why there were so many and no one was doing anything about it, maybe because it was the weekend and not many people come on a Saturday. But on the weekdays I didn't see any flies.

Eventually, she had to use her words to explain. I said there's one in the case. She said, ""Yeah, but that's display."" I replied, ""You can't sell it to me?""

The line was quickly getting longer and two people behind me left the store rather than continue to wait. 

I got up to order my drink and apparently the Starbucks' on the east coast is ""spiced"" rather than ""caramel"" on the west coast. I just asked for apple cider and she seemed very confused. Finally after a few back and forth questions, I just told her to make it the way they normally make it.

It gets a little crowded in the morning with the line going to the door, but they're trying to get better with that with having people take your orders way in advance so the line stays moving. 

If you happen to be a student, you get a discount. Show them your ID at the register when taking your order and they'll apply it without hesitation. By doing so, two or three other students in line who have not been using their ID for a discount will take note and you will probably make a friend.

The coffee is consistent and is the same every morning / afternoon / night. The service is pretty good - they've gotten a lot better over the couple of years that I have been coming here.

This is a small spot, but they do make an effort to have ample seating for everyone. There are a lot of stools to sit on against the windows, and then there's one large table near the entrance where they place additional seats. Even then, it can be a little difficult grabbing a seat on some days."

It's located near John Jay College, Fordham University, and Roosevelt Hospital, so it's always packed with students, professors, doctors, and interns. Also, if you're a student, they give you a discount if you show them your ID. I'm not a student but I pass for one, so I've been getting my discount for a few years.

See a lot of complaints about lack of a restroom, but I think that's pretty typical in smaller shops that cater to office workers who are just stopping by for a pick-me-up in the morning or afternoon so don't really see why people are attacking a franchise store for a smaller layout -- my current Starbucks only has 4 little stool-seats (and no restroom)!"

She couldn't locate all the ingredients and one of the containers didn't have tongs to take out what she needed so she proceeded to tumble the contents into my cup rather than locate the tong and remove the proper quantity to make my drink. Not very scientific measuring. Another gentleman ordered the same thing I did but just a larger cup of it. After she poured his drink, there must have been another inch or so to fill it up so she just dumped in extra ice to make up the difference. I knew he was short-changed and, judging by his reaction, so did he.

They don't have any restrooms for customer use, so beware if you're someone who needs to run to the can after downing a lot of coffee. I guess that's one way they can turn over customers and prevent people from buying a cup of joe and camping out there for several hours."

Unfortunately, I got two mosquito bites here. Those sneaky little bastards. Also there are no restrooms here."
1176,starbucks-new-york-138,2018-05-28,4.0,Nice group of people who do a good job at a very busy location. Service is generally pretty prompt and people are friendly.
1176,starbucks-new-york-138,2017-10-31,1.0,There is a Starbucks half a block down between 6th and 7th on both 56th and 57th. Go to one of those before you come here. I have come to this Starbucks a handful of times and the staff is consistently slow and rude. Today they did not even tell me when my latte was ready (just handed me my bagel without saying anything and when I walked to the drink pick-up my drink was awkwardly up on a ledge - not on the empty counter space -  and I had to ask if it was mine) and even then my drink tasted off. This was the final straw in a string of bad experiences and I was already coming here only as a last resort (the other locations had long lines or were closed) but will not be returning to this location again.
1176,starbucks-new-york-138,2016-06-12,3.0,"If you've been to one Starbucks, you've pretty much been to them all. And unless it's really horrible slow service or supreme excellent service, they're pretty much all one in the same. With that being said...a 3."
1176,starbucks-new-york-138,2018-06-10,1.0,"Worst Starbuck store I've ever been in. I made a mobile order 5 minutes before I got there, but when I got there, my drink was not there so I waited. I waited and waited and waited, after about 15 minutes of waitng I caught a hold of an employee and told them I ordered 15 minutes ago and my drink is still not ready, he asked if I ordered for 56th and 6th I said yes and showed him my phone, he looked at it and just left, when he came back, he acted like nothing happened and left me wondering what happened to my drink. I asked another employee, she saw my phone, and asks ""strawberry acai refresher?"" I said yes, and she just gave me someone else's drink that has been sitting on the counter for a while that most of the ice has already been melted."
1176,starbucks-new-york-138,2018-01-20,1.0,"Friday morning I mobile ordered a drink, because I was in a bit of a rush. I ordered a latte with ALMOND milk. I got to the counter and still had to wait a bit, which was fine. I watched the barista making the drinks - I then saw her pour soy milk into the metal measuring cup (marked SOY) to steam it. I kept watching when I knew it wasn't my drink she was making, because she was using soy. I saw her pour, steam, pour, cover the drink and then place it on the counter in front of me and call out my name and mobile order. I asked her if it was made with ALMOND milk, just to hear her response when I clearly saw her use Soy. To my surprise she said yes.  I was so mortified- why would you bold faced lie like that?????? It was so ridiculous!! I have never had an issue like that in any Starbucks - if they make the drink wrong they remake it. I will not be going make here again with dishonest people. Because what if I am not there to catch her mistake/lie - That behavior is so dangerous, people ask for certain milk options for health reasons - I simple cannot have soy, it makes me sick and gives me headaches. The next person could have a worse issue. I HOPE THEY SEE THIS AND CORRECT THEIR STAFF ABOUT LYING TO CUSTOMERS....I will not be going back to this location ever!!! If I can't trust them to make the drink correctly they simply won't get my money!!!!!"

The cashier who took my order appeared disgruntled in a monotone assembly line, lifeless demur.  The pick-up area counter is quite spacious as the person assembling the coffee/tea/hot chocolate orders is very pleasant and user friendly cheerful vibe.

The seating area is much larger than other Starbucks I've encountered.  I don't know if there is a restroom open to the public."

1176,starbucks-new-york-138,2013-11-27,1.0,"Staff is loud and rude. While making a drink the girl was yelling to the other girl about personal issues and dropping F bombs. Costumers are waiting for them to finish their conversation. Unprofessional to say the least. 

Lack of seating space and a few tables you where you have to stand."

Due to the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure if I wanted to waste my time and money trying this place, but one morning while visiting, I wanted a quick breakfast, so my daughter and I tried it. I was pleasantly surprised! Their lattes were very good. And although their food appears to be prepackaged, it was still very good. I recommend this place if you want a break from Starbucks and need a coffee and quick breakfast!"

1179,pret-a-manger-new-york-96,2018-12-30,5.0,Quick and easy. Great sandwiches and coffee. Breakfast brioches aren't as good however. I would recommend it as more of lunch place as oppose to breakfast.
1180,dunkin-new-york-106,2017-10-18,3.0,"I stop here in the mornings on my way down 50th to get to my office.  Its located right outside the subway and if you're coming from the street you might miss it because you need to walk down the stairs, and then it's right next to the barber shop.  

Line is never too long, even when a subway just lets out, and the workers always keep the line moving.  Service is always pleasant and quick and exactly how a Dunkin' should be.  I've never had a bad experience here so far.  They make my coffee just as well as any other Dunkin' I've been to which is all you can ask from a Dunkin' anyway.  Always walk away with my coffee tasting exactly as I want it!"
1180,dunkin-new-york-106,2018-04-09,2.0,"This Dunkin Donuts is a bit bigger than the one located on 52nd and 7th but it's harder to find since you have to walk down a few flights of stairs. The staff at this location is friendly, quick and there is almost no wait. However, they tend to rush and do shoddy work. Half cream cheese smeared bagel, putting the frosted side of the donut down and sometimes just throwing your food like it has no value. I would like this place if they took pride in how they present their food."
1180,dunkin-new-york-106,2018-09-01,1.0,"It's sad because this would have been a 5 Star review. I simply went for an iced coffee, the line was short and the drink was made very quickly and technically it was made correctly also.

 However, when the man was making my drink, he looked at the stirring spoon, and then put it into the sanitizer bucket, swished it around, and then put it straight into my coffee to stir it.

I was initially disgusted but then I thought ""you know, maybe they just keep their clean water in the sanny for some reason"" so I accepted the drink.

My first sip, some sort of food came up the straw and i immediatly gagged and I took the entire drink and threw it away. Biggest waste of $3.47 in my life.

Disgusting"

Its Dunkin Donuts for crying' out loud, you come in here to get your Iced Latte when your addiction Starbucks has burned a hole in your wallet. Still, for $3.28 they make a decent enough Iced Latte, also the wait time at this location is usually not too long :)"
1180,dunkin-new-york-106,2014-09-30,3.0,"Never really a fan of DD coffee but came in for the free coffee in honor of national coffee day!

They served me a dark roast and it tasted pretty gross. I had a sip then tossed the entire cup out. If I had to pay for it, you best believe I would be a pissed customer. The decor is very typical of DD, nothing too special. I would not recommend it as a place to study and hang out.

BL: No, I wouldn't come to this place for coffee."
1180,dunkin-new-york-106,2015-04-08,4.0,"Another great DD, easily accessible from the subway entrance. Donuts are always fresh and tasty...can't get enough of these buggers. Coffee is always good as well. Service comes with a smile! America runs on Dunkin!"
1180,dunkin-new-york-106,2013-05-22,2.0,I've never been asked so many questions on how to make my latte and have it still come out bad. It's a shame this is the closest Dunkin Donuts to my office.

Being from Melbourne our expectations of coffee is pretty high and isn't your regular black coffee. Most of our group wasn't impressed by the coffee but I'd say that's due to the fact that we're not used to having straight black coffee.

I didn't think the coffee wasn't too bad but it was strange at first and it didn't taste like the coffee I'm used to."

I'm guessing those fools didnt know that i can understand their language, but they said ""oh they only look, they don't buy"" like what!? How dare you!

1180,dunkin-new-york-106,2013-04-17,3.0,This DD is located by the entrance to the subway. Super convenient and close to work. It's a small location so when they get busy be prepared to stand outside the door.

This location did not have that large of a donut variety, I was craving a raspberry powdered sugar donut, however they only had jelly donuts.  I got a chocolate frosted donut for my friend, who said his was a bit stale and was a bit skimpy on the frosting and sprinkles."

The staff is friendly but you need to speak up and say your order.  i ordered iced coffee and they came with regular coffee. then got a bit upset when i said iced as i do not drink regular coffee. 

even in the times square area the prices are pretty much the same as other locations"

1183,dunkin-new-york-123,2019-02-18,2.0,"While having a gold mine location at the Port Authority Bus Terminal with lines day and night the service is one of the worse I experience from a DD.  From taken customers out of order on line to smashing together of doughnuts in a bag if you don't get a box size on top of poor selections to pick from.

I pass every day on my commute and each time wishing I had a doughnut to take with me only to just walk away empty handed all because I don't want to deal with the terrible staff."

Never had an issue with my order here and when I use their mobile ordering system, it's always ready for me to pick up when I get there. There's free WiFi and a decent  amount of seats. I'm usually in there for only a few mins but without fail I am always greeted by one ore two homeless panhandlers, which is not the best way to start you day."
1183,dunkin-new-york-123,2019-10-18,1.0,Literally the worst DD location I've come across.  Rude and dismissive staff.  Arbitrary rules on item quantities you can buy.  Refusal to honor official Dunkin coupons.  Stay far away.

The ""latte"" I got had no more of a thimble of milk included.. I had to go back and ask for more milk and he gave me a horrible attitude before finally giving more.  There is no mgr or owner here and it shows.. the three stooges would've been better the these guys (chuckles and bozo)"

I said ""that's not necessary"". They've never had to do that before.  It's a waste.  They continued with the plastic and ended up making 2 iced coffees.  So one went to waste and they threw out the plastic.  I pointed out to them that I said this was going to happen and they just stared at me blankly.  Quite frankly I'm not sure any of them spoke English enough to understand the word ""unnecessary"".  I never go to Dunkin' Donuts because they don't have recycling and don't educate their employees on that, or wastefulness, but after this I definitely will NEVER go to them again.  Even if I'm dying of thirst.  It took them how many years to switch from styrofoam?  Forget it.  The WORST company. And in addition to all of this they got my order wrong. TWICE."

The women making food were working quickly, however there seemed to be no system to the order in which they made things and they were definitely understaffed.

All the Starbucks were already closed so when we found this Dunkin' we were relieved. Even tough there is no plug to charge the phones, we gave it to the guy behind the counter who nicely charged them for us. He is the nicest worker I have ever met and gives the best customer service ever. If you are lucky to find him, it's great (his name is Youssouf bamba).
We ended up staying there until 2am drinking the delicious hot chocolates as long with donuts and cheese bagels."

As with any Dunkin Donuts, they tend to load up their coffee with tons of sugar.   Do yourself a favor and ask for no sugar and then just add your own from the self serve counter to your taste.  The was they make it tastes like molasses.

This location also happened to be New York City 500th DD location..That obviously called for a huge celebration.I wish I wasn't driving down that morning.They had a freebies galore happening that day.Tons of people from the media were waiting outside and they were distributing tshirts,coffee mugs, coupons for free coffee and donuts to all passerbys.

Few day later, I finally walked in and the place is huge.Not sure what was there before this.But this place is here to stay.Has a nice welcoming ambiance and they have my beloved donuts..Chocolate Creame..For some reason it seems the hardest one to find..Not sure if other people have experienced this too.So chocolate creme lovers, head over here if you cant get that elsewhere.I also tried their Key Lime Donut and was good change.Had a lemony jelly inside.

I am so so glad they opened at this location, not so sure how my love handles are going to handle that though..!!"

1183,dunkin-new-york-123,2015-10-08,1.0,"I love Dunkin' and prefer the coffee over Starbucks any day.
So being as this one is the closet to my job from walking out of the subway I stop in occasionally. Usually my experience is ""OK"", but this last time I would have to say I am NEVER EVER going to this location again! I would rather get coffee at 7 Eleven down the block.
This place is usually super busy with a lot of customers, but on my last visit it was PACKED. I go order my coffee and plain bagel toasted w/ butter. I get my coffee rather quickly and begin my wait for the bagel. I noticed a few people ahead of me waiting and the number of other customers after me quickly begins to climb. So I wait and wait and wait. The few customers before me still wait and some people after me already rec'd there food and leave.
I see them put a few bagels into the toaster and make sandwiches out of them, but none are made with butter. There is one bagel just sitting on there work stations GETTING COLD obviously it had to be my plain bagel, just sitting there while they cut croissants, muffins, wraps etc....
I speak up and tell them at this point what I am waiting for wave my receipt and barely get an acknowledgement. So i wait for about 5 more minutes and that bagel is still on the counter as they serve more people that were after me.
I am annoyed at this point and a few other customers that were BEFORE me are complaining now. I get the servers attention again and tell them what I am waiting for and she just nods at this point with my patience wearing thin I go back to the cashier and ask for my money back. I complained to the cashier, who also happens to be a manager and say that the people you have working back there need to be better organized and server the people in the order that they came in.
Did get my money back, but i didnt even get an apology for this whole fiasco that lasted nearly 20 minutes.
NEVER EVER AGAIN!"
1183,dunkin-new-york-123,2013-08-03,5.0,Happy to have a DD in the area. It's the 500th in NYC
1186,starbucks-new-york-556,2020-02-15,5.0,"Wed. 2/12/2020:  Great customer service!! The staff was nice, friendly, and courteous. This Starbucks was smaller than others. When I walked in, one of the cashiers smiled and said he can help me. I noticed all of the cashiers and baristas, including the manager, were smiling and courteous. I told him I wasn't ready yet, so he helped another guest. A few minutes later, the manager asked if she can help me. Just the whole process and experience was very pleasant - the only other times I've experienced good customer service from Starbucks was in S. California. I went up to a cashier/barista asking to speak to the manager, and she said she was the manager. I told her I had to compliment all the staff because so far, they have been one of the friendliest and nicest Starbucks I've been to around here. She was very happy and asked if I could email my experience to the GM and thanked me. 

I come from a customer service industry, so I know how consumers should be treated. And this Starbucks definitely exemplified good customer service. Kudos to the manager for doing a great job! Because it all starts with the manager!

To corporate: 
Maybe it's an east coast thing to be rude, but it's no excuse. Starbucks is international, and I expect/ consumer expects the same coffee/drinks from Starbucks anywhere we go, which should be the same with customer service as well."
1186,starbucks-new-york-556,2019-01-06,3.0,"Like Um - why?  Focus more on your job than personal conversation.  I came in this morning and ordered a venti white chocolate mocha with Carmel swirl - $6.59

Asked me how I was paying, I scanned my phone - no receipt handed to me, nothing said to me - just left there standing. 

Girl who took my order is now making drink. Asked if I wanted whip cream, which I declined. I'm handed a grande drink, which I state, I ordered a venti. Girl, responds ""well, I charged you for a grande,"" and drops the subject.  I contend I paid for a venti. The other girl then looks up on the register, and corrects her - ""no, you charged her for a venti.""

Girl who made the incorrect size drink, then tells me to give her back the drink.  She takes the drink from me, pours it back into the container, adds milk to it and hands it to me. Are you serious girl????

The drink is cold, not meekly hot, and probably broke all types of health codes.  

Three stars because one of them said good morning, and neither was rude - just absent minded. I returned the bum drink and will sort my coffee fix elsewhere. 

Once again no receipt given to me, nor asked if I wanted a receipt when I returned the cold coffee. I literally had to ask for my receipt after I signed for the refund. 

I will now bypass this location."
1186,starbucks-new-york-556,2020-01-30,2.0,It's Starbucks so coffee wise you can expect the same quality product here as any of their other locations. The service however is horrendous. I come in most days and order plain coffee and consistently wind up waiting 10+ minutes/having to ask about my order multiple times. They always lose the tickets or whatever and make me feel like they're doing me a big favor when they can't find it but just pour me a cup. I get that they're focused on mobile orders but the mechanics of serving coffee to people who order it IRL shouldn't suffer.

I still stop by. I just don't linger if it's crowded.  I just need a tall and a rest!"

The Barista's here were very nice and chatty with all there customers making sure they bring a minimum a smile to there day. New Yorkers are very proud of there city and when they saw me with my Miami Marlins ball cap they let me have it a little but it was all in good fun. Turns out everyone was asking me why I was in New York on vacation with all the Sunny Beaches and warm weather in Miami. ( It has snowed the week before in New York ) It was also currenlty 43 deg when I was there. They whipped my Doppio fast and hot and my girfriends Latte nice and fast as well. The lines were long but they knocked them out fast, they have great team work in there. I came here everyday I was there for my joe, come with confidence!"
1186,starbucks-new-york-556,2018-08-08,1.0,Rude staff. I made my order at 9:08am why is it that multiple coffee orders were made before my simple iced white tea??? I received my order at 9:18am. Why does tea and ice take 10 mins to make after complaining TWO TIMES??? Horribly ran business in this location. Next time.. REFUND!

I ordered two soy latte macchiatos and they came up with regular milk. I explained that they were supposed to be made with soy and the girl just glared at me and said it doesn't say soy. She then proceeded to ignore me. I was so taken aback by her coldness that I said should I go back in line (which was now very long) and pay for the soy? She glared at me again. I got back in line and looked at the board, I calculated that I was indeed charged extra for the soy. The first cashier did not enter it correctly. I went back to the pick up area and another kind customer was telling them that it was terrible that they made me get back in line. The barista next to the rude one said that that my drinks were coming up now. So the sociopath remade my drinks begrudgingly with no apology forthcoming. That's my story and I'm sticking to it! LoL! Had to vent! This would not fly back in Cali."

He was the only one there. He had a line almost to the door and it didn't even phase him. He multitasked like no other. He took orders while heating up sandwiches and making drinks, all the while he was kind and gave personal attention to all the customers. Truly deserves commendation.

Service is somewhat prompt though courteous at least not curt nor abrasive as other standard Starbucks.  The Starbucks brand of China Green tea tips at $2.45 is extremely bitter than its subtle flavor for green tea.

So when that happens I go elsewhere and I found this place around the corner from my favorite Starbucks. They are fast and give great customer service. If you want the baked goods or simple pastries that got that too.
I give them 4 stars because of their Americano is good and the yummi chocolate donuts."

Very earthy and quiet here- great place to study or get some work done for sure.  I'm not your typical coffee drinker so I wasn't sure what to get, but the 2 sweet baristas suggested to order a pumpkin spice latte since it's an autumn favorite  I got that and a slice of the lemon poppy.  The latte was amazing but the lemon poppy was too sweet so I asked if I could take a banana instead. 

I will definitely be back again. I was also told about the Gregory's app that gives you $5credit ! Wooh hooooooooo! Love this place"

When we came in staff was completely uninterested in serving us. After the order went through, I had to go up and ask for my espresso. There was hardly anyone there and the employee had it ready behind the counter but never announced or asked. The lemon loaf and banana leaf were actually good but a bit too big. I won't be going back."
1191,gregorys-coffee-new-york-29,2019-02-04,5.0,"EDIT --- Gregorys Coffee no longer sells CBD coffee, but this doesn't detract from the fantastic service

My friends and I came here to try CBD coffee and were met with amazing service. (CBD is the non-psychoactive compound in cannabis and is supposed to have relaxing properties / reduce anxiety) The baristas spent a lot of time helping us learn more about the CBD that can be added in their coffee. They explained that while any drink can be made with CBD, but recommended #CBD because the strawberry flavor goes well together. 

The coffee was good and I really enjoyed the added strawberry taste although not sure what effect the CBD had. It isn't everyday that the baristas will spend so much time to help you thoroughly understand what you're ordering. We also came on a weekend day when it wasn't as busy. The coffee shop was definitely a nice environment and there were outlets pretty much everywhere. Would definitely recommend this place as somewhere to study or to visit."
1191,gregorys-coffee-new-york-29,2018-11-30,3.0,"A solid 3 stars so far. 

I appreciate that this is a local chain, and actually really like their branding. There's a decent amount of seating at this location, although the row of tables along the wall parallel to the counter is not functional when the coffee rush comes through. 

Their coffee and matcha lattes are quite good, but their food is maybe hit or miss. The biscotti was yummy, but the avocado toast is rip off. Don't make the mistake of throwing away $7 for a blah piece of toast with the ever so thin it is almost not existent smear of avocado spread topped with  a bunch of chili flakes and oil. Don't be fooled by the photo on the website and the other Yelper's pic of their toast, and it is no longer like that. I get that avocados have fluctuated in price, but come on now. Go to La Pecora Bianca for a real avocado toast..."

1191,gregorys-coffee-new-york-29,2017-11-07,5.0,"I'm confused. Why does this place have three stars? It's a hidden gem!

Everytime I stop by in the morning before work, it's not crowded, which is another reason I'm confused. Perhaps because it's slightly hidden or new -- unsure?

It's always super clean, fully staffed -- everything looks impeccable. The staff is always SUPER friendly; in fact, today they are even friendlier. The iced espresso comes as a double shot (so don't opt for a single shot because you're paying for a double anyway -- no complaints there!). Additionally they have this new varied toast menu, which is pretty interesting. Last time I got prosciutto fig over toast. Today I got almond butter chia toast (props to Dejion!). 

For a double iced espresso with a healthy breakfast toast, $8, which is half of what I pay at the other places!

This Gregory's branch is clean, (ingredients) fresh, good quality (coffee/pastries), super friendly, and inexpensive!"

1191,gregorys-coffee-new-york-29,2019-03-30,2.0,"Dirty chai was a bust. The girl must have brewed Chai tea instead of using a concentrate or powder, this making the drink incredibly weak. I took a few sips and went around the corner to Ground Central."
1191,gregorys-coffee-new-york-29,2017-12-18,2.0,"One word: hyper-overpriced.  And this is coming from yet another Starbucks regular.  I see this place popping up everywhere, and it's an excuse to feel a bit more special than another corporate coffee shop yet not bother to explore any local ones (guilty as charged).

Perhaps it's because of the price, the place is often not too crowded, so it can be nice if you plan to stay for a long time and enjoy a nice conversation, I suppose, but if you're looking for a cup of coffee and some food to go with, and you're cost-conscious, it's not ideal.

My biggest gripe was that when I ordered a $4 toast with almond butter and strawberries, I did not expect a single slice of bread with almond butter and half of a strawberry thinly sliced.  The taste, while actually pretty good, did not make up for the price I paid or the sour taste I had in my mouth it left afterward.

Maybe you're paying for the slightly polished ambiance here.  For me, not worth the price."
1191,gregorys-coffee-new-york-29,2018-01-26,4.0,"Great place for quick work meeting or to do some work on your computer. I love Gregory's coffee, their house brew is so rich and flavorful.

There are also many tasty treats, donuts, sweet breads, scones, cookies, and more."

This was a stop of mine while on business in the city, and it turned out to be a highlight of my trip. Not that it was anything ""special,"" in the traditional sense - yeah, Gregory's is a nice, full-featured cafe, no complaints there - but, rather, what made it such a personal standout was the experience itself, just going into a place and getting some good coffee from some good folks and then having a good place to sit down and relax for a bit. _That's_ what set Gregory's apart for me on that day, because it was just what I needed after a particularly turbulent morning (plus, there was even a bathroom!!!).

Really, this is less a review than a simple word of thanks, for providing me a safe, stable place to recover a bit before returning back to the city for round two. I am truly grateful for your service. Keep it up : D"
1191,gregorys-coffee-new-york-29,2018-05-22,5.0,Lavender Latte and Avocado Toast are first rate.  Any type of milk you could possibly desire (including Oat milk) is available. The guy who takes your order couldn't possibly be friendlier. I love this place.

You don't know me, and if I choose to pay in cash it's not convenient for me to be told it's not available. It's bad customer service to dictate the patron experience in this way and I won't be coming back to Gregory's anytime soon. It's frustrating and annoying."
1191,gregorys-coffee-new-york-29,2018-01-03,5.0,"I love this place. Their aeropress coffee actually tastes like coffee, unlike the dirty water that Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts sell. Yes, it's a little expensive, but that's how much real coffee in this city costs. I also really like their snacks -- their protein balls are particularly satiating and delicious. The staff is also extremely polite and competent. I'm quickly becoming a regular!"
1191,gregorys-coffee-new-york-29,2018-09-16,5.0,"Super quaint environment, great music, fantastic coffee. The prices were fabulous- for a medium (16 oz) iced dirty chai and a glazed donut, my total was $9 and some change. Not to mention how scrumptious the donut was. Definitely my new study spot."

1191,gregorys-coffee-new-york-29,2018-03-18,5.0,They were very nice here and the latte was excellent. Would return and try the food. There were also a lot of empty seats so I feel like this would be a nice place to come and hang or do work

1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2020-03-07,5.0,"I usually just get the latte here. Sometimes ya don't realize how good the coffee is here until I try other coffee that is so meh. I came to realize the whole milk they use is so creamy. I like it. 

Quick recap of drinks. 

Hot chocolate is amazingly rich. You can see that they have this pot of thick melted chocolate that they pour from. Quite satisfying to see. 
When you reach the bottom of the cup you can see melted chocolate sunk there. Sometimes I add milk and bam more hot chocolate. 

Mocha. Somehow it's not as good as the latte nor hot chocolate.

New Orleans. I like getting it in the summer. The  sweetness is refreshing and comes out as an undertone rather than in your face. 

In terms of pastries I don't get it often. They're solid but not particularly special/memorable. 
I came to write a review this time because I just had a blondie yesterday and thought it was very worth mentioning. 

I felt like getting a pastry so I had my eyes on the tea cake and blondie. I asked the staff which one I should get and she recommended the blondie. 

I would view blondies in the same perspective as brownies on a spectrum of cakey to fudgey. I used to think I like it closer to the fudge end but this blondie changed my mind. It's not fudgey at all nor is it cakey, can't even place it on the spectrum. 

Anyway it's approx 3.5"" long and 1.5"" wide and .75"" thick - making up numbers from memory okay 
The outside is stiff, not crunchy not crusty not hard. The texture is solid yet not dense. It's very satisfying. 

All over the outside there's big obvious flakes of salt. It ought to be sea salt because it's not an insulting saltiness. Tbh I've never had a sweets with that much salt that obvious on it. It took me by surprise but it was a pleasant surprise every bite. They amount of salt is different every bite. 

I also must comment how I'm often afraid of white chocolate things being too sweet. This was not at all. I don't think it's completely related to the salt. There's the sweet milkiness without being overly sweet. 

I don't expect myself to crave this blondie but I'm impressed"
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2020-01-18,2.0,"I've been meaning to try blue bottle coffee for a while and finally decided to stop by after having lunch. The first time I came, I got the New Orleans latte which was just okay.

I returned the very next day since I needed a drink. The place was crowded since most people were making their afternoon coffee runs. I ordered a hojicha latte which was bland and tasted like straight-up milk. I should've known better than to order an Asian drink at a non-Asian place. 
The order also took forever to get. They prioritized the coffee and espresso orders before mine. I saw everyone in line that ordered after me, get their orders first. 

Probably will not be back as the coffee isn't amazing and a tad bit more expensive than Starbucks yet the coffee didn't taste that much better."
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2020-01-05,4.0,"I'm familiar with the name, just never prior have tried the coffee from here only be a use they don't have any locations near where I live. Problems of small town living. Mainly dominated by Dunkin' Donuts or other attempts at coffee shops. 

Now typically I'm gonna opt for a Starbucks, not because it's great, but they have consistently good coffee. Well after having coffee from here. I can safely say that I'm gonna throw that idea right out the window. 

I had a drip coffee from here; honestly can't remember the name or origin of the beans. But for the price tag it was comparable to that of most other major chain locations. So it's not that bad, as a matter of fact it's about average. 

Despite having to wait for what felt like 10 minutes, it was absolutely worth every minute. The taste and texture of the coffee was both rich, and velvety. I was actually very well pleased with how it came out. 

After having tried this, it's changed my mind on how coffee should be brewed, how it should taste, and overall; it's something that should be slowly sipped, and enjoyed. 

Next time I have the availability to stop in and grab a cup, I'm definitely doing so. I will have to even get my wife to try some too. She's a coffee lover herself. And they didn't disappoint!"
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2020-03-01,5.0,"I absolutely love Blue Bottle Coffee!! They do an amazing pour over thats scientifically perfected.

1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2019-10-08,5.0,"Always a fan of blue bottle coffee and their care for consistency of quality.

This location is in the underground level of Rockefeller Center. Small location with not very much seating. Customer service is wonderful, and the line moves very quickly.

Tried a pour-over Ethiopia and an americano.

Both were fantastic and on par with every experience I've had with blue bottle coffee in the past.

The perfect stop when exploring Rockefeller Center!"
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2019-07-11,5.0,"They moved and remodeled to the space adjacent to the original. Still at the Rockefeller Center concourse level. The new store is lovely! They expanded it to have seating and the atmosphere is consistent with the other locations. They make every cup with great technique and diligence. I love Blue Bottle's coffee beans because they are extremely fresh and the aroma is genuinely delightful. 

It definitely gets busy during the 2-3 pm afternoon break that the employees in the building take, but their service is usually relatively quick and hospitable. 

Definitely recommend trying! It is top tier compared to other coffee shop chains (ahem... starbucks for example)."
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2020-02-17,4.0,"I used to come here when it used to be in a smaller space. Now they have seats, I like it even more!! I was able to find a seat immediately for a while, but there have been more people visiting for some reason. Last week, the place was pretty much packed sometime past 1 pm on a weekday, and it took a bit of time to find a seat. Anyways, the staff are great here, they got friendlier than I remembered. This is one of the few Blue Bottle Coffee serving the waffles - I think they are the best pastry here and highly recommend it."
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2019-09-08,4.0,"Nice new store with plenty of seatings.
Fast service.

Pricy latte but this is New York where $5 latte is the norm.
beautifully poured latte art and nicely textured steam milk was light and silky.if they used organic milk then probably will justify the price tag.organic=future.

No WiFi. Plenty of bakery nearby (hello,ladyM!) to choose and pair with coffee."
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2019-12-07,4.0,"The staff is a hit or miss but the cappuccinos here are strong, intense and wake you the eff up! It's a longer wait than the normal coffee shop so don't come here in a rush, their coffee is made to ""order""."
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2019-08-05,5.0,"Fantastic coffee, probably the most consistent around for this third wave coffee that is readily available. They have a few locations which means you should not be settling for the run of the mill coffee anymore. It's around the $4 to $5 mark but that's just become the norm for this tier of quality.

It is worth it though, if you are ok spending a little more for a good cup. The cold brew is so good. Flat white is top quality too. They have some interesting other options (coffee tonic) which are for the more adventurous that you won't find elsewhere.

They don't really advertise their milk choices but try oat milk in future. It honestly adds a layer of complexity and you don't need to add sugar after that."
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2019-06-25,5.0,I love their new location!!! It's so spacious and there's a lovely sitting area! Delicious coffee and went around 3:00 the line went fast and there was plenty of barista to serve everyone! Best service!

Great place to get coffee before/during work although there is limited seating so it's probably not the best place to sit and catch up."
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2020-02-25,1.0,"No doubt their espresso and pour coffee is aromatic and strong. I do appreciate a good cup of java and what I don't like is their customer service. It leaves little to be desired. Their cashiers are not at all friendly and rush you all the time. I know you have a queue but isn't that a good thing? This last visit is what prompted me to write this review. The Spanish dude just shouted Heyyyyyy..... when I took my eyes off to look at the menu , because I think he wants to quickly serve his Spanish lady friend behind me(as they were already  having a conversation while he was serving other customers). He didn't ask me for my name when I ordered the cold brew and I have to ask the barista to check for me  after awhile. 
When I have the cold brew, it is not what I expected. It is served in a coffee cup with big cubes of ice???? Maybe that's your style but I won't be coming back anytime soon. Too many good choices out there to waste my money on establishment that don't appreciated my business. I will stick to my friendly Starbucks coffee shops."

Keep in mind that it does get crowded, so expect about 5 minutes of a wait time, especially during peak times. My manager and I ordered a hojicha latte with oat milk, and we were not disappointed. The texture was extremely smooth, and the taste was in between bold and subtle. That being said, it didn't last very long. As much as I wanted to savor it, I drank it so very fast! I wish it was a little warmer since I love my drinks hot, but I understand why they serve it at the temperature given. I will 100% be back for more afternoon pick me ups!"
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2019-11-08,4.0,"After waiting for 10 minutes for a hot matcha latte and watching a few folks that ordered their beverages after me, somehow got their orders before me. I have asked the staff if they had my name and my order and added that I need to go back to work thinking that if they didn't have it, I would just leave. One of the staff commented ""everyone is here need to go to work"". My response was ""true, but people got their drinks first were folks after me, and matcha is pre-made already (they have dissolved matcha powder already). I got my order right away... but I would say ""matcha latte with a side of attitude"" is not worth it.
***UPDATE*** as of Nov 8, 2019. I have been contacted the same day by customer service and offered a complimentary drink card. Thank you for being responsive and working on improving customer experience. The rating has been updated from 1 to 4.
Thanks"
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2019-06-27,5.0,Moving to an adjacent door front actually really helps with all the foot traffic that comes through this Blue Bottle location. Fortunately nothing has changed either in terms of the selection of drinks. The only drawback is that their Oji cold brew sells out way too fast. This version of their cold brew is only available at this location in Manhattan! The staff is lovely and I have had nothing but great experiences interacting with them. Cheers to the new storefront and added seating area!
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2019-10-11,3.0,"Like most blue bottles I've been to, this was a ""miss"" experience. I ordered an SO cortado (papa new Guinea), watched the barista dump the prior shot's spent puck into the knockbox, and immediately dose my coffee without wiping the spent coffee grounds residue out of the basket... No surprise, the cortado was crazy bitter; I ended up throwing it out after a couple sips. Wish I could get my $5.25 back .....

UPDATE: changed from 1 star to 3 stars; blue bottles customer service got in contact with me and refunded me the drink. Hopefully they were able to reinforce some fundamentals with the staff for the benefit of future patrons."

Hispanic male barista was rather inappropriate hovering and taking photos of my drink while I waited to receive it acting as if he was shocked that I ordered such a drink. I found the whole thing off putting and unprofessional. Unless he is new, surely he has seen coffee made before, so he should let his colleague get the drink out."
1192,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-20,2019-09-08,1.0,"One star is way over its due merit!  Ordered a double espresso, then I thought they were pranking me! It was about half an ounce! What a joke!  I asked them why it was so small- their response was ""add water"".  Coffee was small, the other coffees were also mediocre and room temperature!  Epic fail! So now I understand why they are in located in the basement. They have no business in the coffee business!"

1193,starbucks-new-york-430,2019-03-15,3.0,"I got scared that I was about to pee myself, so I went to Scarebucks.

I'm very grateful to the existence of this Starbucks because while the bathroom has a code, you can just wait for somebody else to come out of it and it totally saved my life in Times Square, because there really aren't a lot of bathrooms to go around in this little neighbourhood. Little being sarcastic in this case.

They also have a few places to sit down which I appreciated."
1193,starbucks-new-york-430,2019-09-24,1.0,"Never ever go to this Starbucks within 30 minutes of their scheduled closing time.

This location is in the Marriot and is SUPER small.  The line go into the hotel.     No place to really sit.

The line took forever...... 

The staff was nice and the coffee was made to order.

This was the worst Starbucks experience of my  life, and I've been a loyal customer for over 15 years. I ordered a decaf cappuccino with one EXTREMELY aggressive barista who seemed to want to rush  me- which is fine; what was NOT fine is that she gave my cup to the next barista who asked me what I ordered (the cup was right in front of her) so I said ""the decaf espresso"" and she YELLED AT ME for not reiterating my entire order (the aggressive barista who took my order was standing 2 millimeters from her watching this interaction happen). Specifically, she was SO mad that I didn't tell her I added a pump of SF vanilla ""because that's extra,"" as if I neglected to say that ON PURPOSE! I almost canceled my order. I will NEVER go back here- and if I need a coffee while I'm in the area again, I will find another coffee shop."

Very pleasant barista served my latter pretty fast. 
Then, before I even touched the cup he let me know it's super hot because in this weather they make sure it's extra warm....how sweet! 
This place is super clean and the condiment table was spotless and filled till max with all kind of sugar and milk. 
Didn't check their bathroom though...lol...didn't fill like going there just for an experience...."

Facts: 

- charged $1 extra (around %20 more) 
- asked and confirmed indeed is more expensive 
- Apple Pay won't work 
- green tea ""watered down"" ( with the milk in this case) 

Enough said."
1193,starbucks-new-york-430,2018-05-05,5.0,"Walking in to this little Starbucks where the line appears long and disorganized was actually a little gem. I'm here for conference in the Marriott Marquis and this was convenient. William was in the back taking orders of people in line several members in advance. He was courteous yet efficient and alert to special requests. By the time I was first in line to pay, I already had my coffee in hand. Must be the first time I gave a tip at a Starbucks in a long long time. I appreciate efficiency without the attitude that typically comes along with it, but here, lots of smiling faces and quick service. I will be happy to come back and continue to support this little Starbucks."
1193,starbucks-new-york-430,2018-04-04,4.0,"Best kept secret in New York. The coffee here was seriously the best coffee I have EVER had. Such a hidden gem, tucked away in a quintessential area in Times Square NYC.  Kind of weird though ... the people at the counter ask for your name, which seems a little forward if you ask me.

Will most certainly be back next time I'm in the area."
1193,starbucks-new-york-430,2018-12-17,1.0,Absolutely horrible customer service.  Worst one I have been in and I am a loyal drinker of their products.  The obviously take the location for granted.  Looks like I'll need to find an alternative in NYC....
1193,starbucks-new-york-430,2019-04-20,1.0,"Worst place ever! I ordered a tall ice Carmel macchiato and after waiting forever I finally received a milked down drink that also seemed to be watered down because it had little to no ice left in the cup. He waited so long to get to my drink that the ice he placed in there had melted. And on top of that there was no coffee in there and my drink was not full. I asked for more coffee to be added to which the man deliberately inserted a little less than a drop full and handed it back to me looking the exact same way almost, instead of actually putting more coffee in like I had asked him. Not wanting to hold up more customers I left but I was not satisfied at all and will never return to this place!!!!!"

The lines can be very, very long and this place is very small but it's always super clean and the line moves fairly fast for the most part.

You can enter the Marriott Hotel through this Starbucks and they have limited outside seating.  If staying at the Hotel you can sign your charge up to your guestroom.

They do accept credit cards but they do not accept the Starbucks App."
1193,starbucks-new-york-430,2017-12-29,3.0,"I will always love my Grande Hot Caramel Macchiato, that's 5 stars to me. However, the staff here was quite rude. I know it's the holidays and people can be rude themselves but that's never the case with me. I know what it's like to work in restaurants/retail so I'm always  nice. The barista was giving a harsh attitude and lying to me saying my chocolate croissant was ready when it wasn't. She even was giving people their treats before me who were behind me. I've never received such rude/petty service."
1193,starbucks-new-york-430,2017-12-18,1.0,"I love starbucks and my family loves starbucks, and this starbucks location was good, being that it is in a hotel. It doesn't matter to me that it's a small location. The only thing that bothered me was the one of the workers. This workers name was Pam. She was so rude and disrespectful and made me not want to come back to starbucks. She clearly hates her job and hates talking to people. When my group was leaving she actually had to ""step out"" because this worker was getting so angry. Also my group ordered breakfast sandwiches, all but one of our breakfast sandwiches were frozen cold. Never have I had a cold breakfast sandwich in my life.  All of this and more ruined the starbucks experience for me. Everyone else on the starbucks staff was very kind and thankful. Just because of Pam I might not be coming back."

My boyfriend and I stopped by on our way to the hotel and waited over 30 minutes for our drinks when there was only two people in front of us. First off, a guy took my order, told me to move to the next register where a lady took my payment for the order and then proceeded to tell me to wait at the end of the counter. Long story short, somewhere in that process, they forgot about my order and didn't even make the drinks. Very annoying. And poor communication between the workers."

1193,starbucks-new-york-430,2016-03-11,1.0,"Truly the worst Starbucks I have ever visited. For such a prime spot in the middle of the theater district in NYC you would expect the best in terms of service and efficiency which unfortunately is just not the case at this Starbucks. This is a location you would really like to see on a episode of undercover boss so corporate could take a closer look and make some positive changes. 
One important change would be implementing a scanner so that you could pay with your app here. I understand not having mobile ordering in such a high volume area, but no scanner?! Ive literally never been to another store that didn't have one.
They were clearly frantic behind the counter but the service was slow. Maybe I was just in on an off day where they were training new people or something but everyone seemed to be on edge - I even saw a barista yell at a customer because they didn't respond fast enough when he called her order. 
One star goes to my well executed drink - I probably wouldn't have said anything if it was wrong anyway just so I could get out of here."
1193,starbucks-new-york-430,2016-05-25,3.0,"I don't know why this place has bad reviews. Maybe because I am very simple and I always order a pike place.

1193,starbucks-new-york-430,2016-04-08,1.0,Worst Starbucks ever visited. Workers here welcome visitors that bringing them business with signature New Yorker hospitality. Going there only because it's right at the hotel I'm staying. They will always get business because it's Starbucks and its convenient. Maybe that's why the workers don't have any incentive to learn courtesy.

Never messes up an order and does it with a smile. It can get crowded but he handles it quickly. GIVE HIM A RAISE. He's a one man show!

I would call this an express Dunkin'. However, I was very satisfied with the customer service. The cashier was very nice and that made up for the fact that there weren't any good donuts left.
There's no seating in this location, I guess it's more of a grab your morning coffee and go type of place. Like I said, express Dunkin"
1196,dunkin-new-york-163,2019-01-22,4.0,"This location is very fast paced and has no seating available. I guess because of its large volume of customers, the staff doesn't look very happy. Nonetheless, the food was good and the orders were always correct. We went every morning for breakfast during our NYC stay and every morning the line was long but moved quickly and people were in and out. You can tell its mostly locals who frequent. We were the only ones standing while we ate in a little area they have."

I noticed my drink had a marker mark in the inside and brought it back for them to change it and see for themselves what was wrong with it. I did not receive any apologies from the staff at the time. I then contacted corporate and the franchise owner reached out to me to apologize. As a compensation, I was only offered a medium drink. Ridiculous. Never will I spend a single penny at any Dunkin Donuts ever again."
1196,dunkin-new-york-163,2019-06-16,1.0,The worst customer service I have ever experienced. The cashier body shamed me for ordering a large iced coffee instead of a medium. They should be ashamed of how their employees treat patrons.

But when I order something and have to repeat myself several times to correct my order it's too much. I ordered an iced tea and a bagel with butter, the cashier said bagel with cream cheese? I said no, bagel with butter. Waited for my order, they called out ""bagel with butter"" I get back to my office and guess what I got? A bagel with cream cheese, just what I wanted on a 90 degree day...a warm bagel with warm cream cheese. Get your act together Dunkin!"
1196,dunkin-new-york-163,2018-05-21,1.0,Horrible Service in the morning. I've been here several times and seen the same guy that looks like he's been there the longest and tells the other workers what to do not give a F&@$ about the customers. I come in expecting for someone to take my order instead they are either talking with each other or organizing inventory. But no one to take orders at 5:30am. I have somewhere to be that early and am expecting my coffee and bagel ASAP so that I can get to work. Customer Service needs to be improved or they need to consider changing who they have on the morning shift. FYI I'm not talking bout 1 bad experience but months worth of observation and only come here because this is the only Dunkin' Donuts near my job.
