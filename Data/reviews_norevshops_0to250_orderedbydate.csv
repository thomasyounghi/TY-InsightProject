2,kabisera-new-york-2,2020-06-22,5,"the almond iced latte i got was great and the lady that made it was so sweet i'm sad i didn't catch her name. i have to come back to try the bibingka - call ahead of time to make sure they have some, she said she could have it ready in 20 min"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2020-05-27,5,I ordered the ube latte and hands down it was the best ube flavored anything I've ever had. We ordered cassava cake as well and it was delicious! The owners were so kind and hospitable. Can't wait to try their other Filipino treats next time.
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2020-05-16,1,"If I could, I would leave no stars for my order.. I ordered a dozen Ube Pandesal that cost $36. When it arrived, the bread looked good and tasty, however when we bit into them the bread was flavorless, hard as a rock and extremely stale. We order 6 regular and 6 with cheese and the regular ones were dry and hard and the ones with cheese were not fresh. We asked for a refund- even a partial one as we are Filipino and know what fresh pandesal is supposed to taste like but the restaurant refused and said that the bread was made fresh. I know this is an outright lie because they do not bake the ube pandesal fresh- it is outsourced and made through Sweet Habana Catering so this in itself was dishonest. 

The bread tasted like it had been in the fridge or frozen for definitely more than a week and just reheated and I was extremely disappointed that they were dishonest about baking it fresh and refused to give even a partial refund for something so expensive. They charged $36 for a dozen when Sweet Habana Catering who makes the actual ube pandesal sells it 8 for $15. 

Will definitely not be ordering here again."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2020-05-03,5,"Impeccable family-owned business. Super cordial, clean, honest and hardworking individuals who braves the social-media driven pandemic. Oh, and their food is delicioso too! Don't sleep on this hidden gem."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2020-02-23,5,Awesome hole in the wall coffee shop. Great atmosphere and very nice ladies behind the counter who greeted my girlfriend and i with a smile the moment we walked in.
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-10-14,5,Love the vibe you get when you first step in. Cozy and relax the perfect brunch place in NYC. The food is amazing. Definitely try their turkey panini and ube latte. The staff is very nice and has a great smile. Don't miss out on this place if you're look for a nice light brunch spot near Chinatown.
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-10-14,5,Best breakfast cafe in nyc! Breakfast was delicious and the staff was super nice. The environment inside was great for the morning in a busy city. I definitely recommend this place. Can't wait to come back.
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-10-14,5,"Great place for a whole meal, atmosphere is cozy and uplifting. Overall vibe will definitely bring up your mood. Food is beyond amazing! Best breakfast place! Everything is so fresh!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-10-11,4,"Chicken adobo panini is delicious. Turkey panini was ""wet"". Desserts are OK. Staff is friendly. Will I come back? Doubtfully"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-10-07,5,"Food, service, interior design, whole vibe-- is really calming. Made my day coming here!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-10-05,5,"New shop, right next door to the old colorful location. (Old space is now serving ice cream.)

Cute, comfortable space with more seating. Delicious fun drinks like ginger latte, and Ube latte. 

We ordered the adobo chicken quesadilla this morning and it was really good. I'd try more of the food just because of how much I liked this quesadilla.

Everyone working in the cafe is friendly and happy to answer any questions. Visit this cafe, it's a true gem."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-09-25,5,We happened by just for coffee and ended up grabbing some ensemada and going back the next day for longaniza quesadilla. It was served with a tasty salad. The staff is welcoming and personable. This place is definitely worth trying!
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-09-12,5,"Very friendly people that own and work there. 

Just tried their purple rice tofu bowl ( was able to add chicken) and it's really good. Very fresh and I think there is some kimchi ( or similar radish) in this !  It's dressed / seasoned perfectly. 

Will be back to try their paninis ! 

Thank you !"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-07-21,5,"Good coffee, reasonable prices, good AC, good wifi, nice seating area, friendly Barista.  What more can you ask for?

The interior looks nothing like the pictures though, I thought I was reviewing the wrong place for a bit..."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-06-13,5,"Quick and Friendly service. Nice place to be. She knows all the coffee  you would love to taste. 
Ask for her purple ice cream  yummmmmy!!!!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-06-12,4,"I came here for breakfast on a Wednesday morning.  The place was pretty empty and there was a lot of seating.  My sister and I ordered an iced matcha latte, iced coffee, and a rice bowl to share.  The rice bowl had purple rice, tofu, avocado, cucumbers, scallions, pickled onions, and coconut.  The iced matcha latte had good matcha flavor and not too watery.  I appreciated that they give you a metal straw, very eco-friendly.  The rice bowl was nutritious and healthy.  The purple rice was interesting. I didn't really like the onions though, they were very salty.  The portion was large so it was good to share it.  I would come back again and maybe try their pastries."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-05-21,5,Got the ube latte and cupcake! Both were good but latte was the standout! Great place to do some work and have good snacks and drinks :)
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-05-20,1,Great example of New York city life and overcome with myself part of it. Come to see what developers can buy and bring togetherness in common place
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-05-08,4,"Lovely cafe with lots of seatings towards the back. Came here to try their specialty lattes and pastries; and it was good. Their Almond croissant was buttery, airy, and filled with Marzipan inside- very tasty. I wanted something different than the typical latte, so asked the barista for a hot Ube Latte ($6). Drink came out in this lavender color and looked really good. The taste of the latte was a bit lackluster, it wasn't really hot enough nor sweet enough for me. Would've wish it had more of the Ube taste rather than it being milky.  The bathroom is really small and cramped so be warned. Music selection wasn't too loud with heavy rotation of pop music. Overall, will definitely come back for my Almond croissant and other pastries."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-05-03,5,"Great service, relaxing environment for work and the most delicious and authentic tasting matcha I've had in a long time! Tried to turn down the Filipino treats but couldn't resist getting a bibingka which was both delicious and unique."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-04-10,5,"Came in while visiting from LA because I'd heard they have ube lattes. It was such a colorful, inviting space and the owner was so friendly! The ube latte was delicious and it came with cute kitty latte art on top! I can't wait to visit the new space as I'll soon be a NYC resident and plan on coming in for many more ube lattes!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-04-09,5,"This coffee shop knows how to treat customers right and for that I will always go back here. The owner is the sweetest lady in the world. Every time I come in here with my girlfriend, we end up having a nice five minute chat as complete strangers (and leave with delicious, and cheap drinks). Additionally, they have an awesome reward system here, where every fifth drink you order is free. And that free drink can be anything from a cold brew to a dirty chai to whatever your mind can imagine. They just moved into a new space right next door and I cannot wait to see the food they start putting out of that larger space."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-04-04,5,"I went to their second location next door. The vegan banana cake was great! The original colorful cafe is closed at the moment, but looking forward to coming back to see it."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-03-29,4,"I was being adventurous and entered this small colorful coffee shop on a whim. Every wall and ceiling is painted in a bright colors with coffee-themes. The VitaliTea is spicy sweet with lemon & honey. The gluten-free walnut cookie didn't have any flavor but it was crunchy. I enjoyed the casual atmosphere. The drink menu contains a lot of unique Filipino drinks found nowhere else in NYC. There is a wireless printer & free wifi. There's no bathrooms. Since shop is less than 200 square feet total, I recommend going here solo rather than in a large group. I would love to try more speciality drinks here when I visit in the future."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-03-19,5,"Such a warm and inviting coffee shop where you can anchor down at one of the communal table corners and allow that creativity to work. WiFi fills the air and goes straight into your phone since you'll minimally be in trans by the artwork on the walls. #ubelatte dominants the menu while cross cultural worlds collide with the chicken adobo panini. The people behind the scenes makes sure we have what we need and then some. A place to relax, work, read and play."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-02-24,5,This is probably my favorite cafe in LES. It's small and cozy with a friendly neighborhood feel. The snacks are great and drinks are made well -- you can't go wrong here. Check it out and get the points card
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-02-22,5,"Such a fun spot! I stopped in on a Friday night while trying to kill some time before meeting up with a friend. The barista/cashier was super sweet. It was pretty quiet since they were about to close, but service was very quick. I had a whole milk latte and pumpkin bread, both which were top notch! I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-02-06,5,"This place small but cozy! The interior has a lot of personality and the drinks are good! I tried their ube latte and mint choco cream latte. Initially, the worker messed up my mint choco cream latte because it was their first time making it, but I didn't even notice and she came up to me offering to remake my drink. The ube latte tastes fresh unlike most places where you can taste the powder. 
I really appreciated that.The person working there gave me a free piece of cake when I asked what one of them was so that I could try it. They also give little punch cards and when you reach 10 you get a free drink, but they keep the card instead and you just tell them your name next time you go there. I think that makes the experience a lot more personal, which is nice. There's also WiFi and an outlet for those who want to do work!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-01-28,5,"I'm breaking my Yelp hiatus to get in my review of these charming and ""joy sparking"" (getting my Konmari in!) coffee shop. I was in the neighborhood and walked into a cheerful cartoon purple hued coffee shop. My friends were already inside and since it was a cold afternoon I opted for ginger tea. It was served on an elegant tea pot and was already brewed for me. I love the effort that they made! 

Since it was  a group that likes to order family-style and share the food, I had both the panini and the ""bibingka"" (a Filipino delicacy usually made with cornflour, milk, sugar and topped with salted egg and cheese) which were both tasty. Top-notch service, tasty food, lovingly crafted coffee and tea, what more can one ask? 

Lastly, I miss Yelp and my Yelp peeps!!!!!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-01-27,4,"cute snug cafe squeezed into Allen St on the Lower East Side.

the colorful interior is filled with fun art + cartoons. there are 3-4 small tables (each seating 2) and there are a few stools. the seating options are limited as this is a very small cafe. the space is clean and kooky with eclectic decor items. the menu of coffee drinks, teas, sweet eats, and savory bites is posted behind the order counter. perfect place for quiet chats over coffee and/or simple eats. this is NOT a laptop cafe as space is limited (THANK GOD for work-free places)! 

much like the chilled out vibe of the cafe, the prices of pretty much everything served here is pretty relaxed. i wouldn't say cheap, but of value...especially for Manhattan.

i really like the drip coffee OR Americano when i am on the go. service is pretty quick. coffee is hot and relatively strong for that weekend caffeine kick before the gym or post-boozy brunch. 

the staff? friendly-ish, not too chatty. 

drops mic cuz i'm caffien(d)ing
i out
zzz"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-01-08,5,"I LOVE THIS CAFE!!! It's kooky with cartoons all over the walls and they have amazing drinks, snacks and employees. Every time I've come in the baristas or owners have been super welcoming. The owners are filipino so some of the food is influenced by that, they often have an adobo panini, ube flavored desserts and such. They have a printer, and free nail polish to borrow while you're there which makes you wanna just hang out there."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2019-01-07,2,"I stopped by here late yesterday afternoon for a coffee and a snack. My total was $5.50, so I handed the barista/cashier a twenty and a single. When I counted my change this morning, I discovered that he only gave me change from $20 (instead of $21). The coffee was good and hit the spot, and the oat bar was excellent. The service was good, too. I just wish the barista/cashier's math skills were better."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-12-17,4,"The store is not very big, but cute, cozy, and colorful. More importantly, you get great value for the price you pay. Drinks here are $1-2 cheaper than most similar cafes in the city. The paninis are even better, $2-6 probably, depending on which overhyped stores you compare with. 

I had a medium skim cafe Au lait and a ham panini that has a thick-enough ham cut, melted mozzarella, and tomato slices, both of which were legitimate and tasty. The panini bread was chewy yet crispy outside, and the whole thing was freshly made after you ordered it. My friend really enjoyed her matcha latte, because it was not too sweet. Her avocado panini had half fresh avocado, mozza, and tomatoes, too. Really simple, but yummy and fulfilling. 

Although we waited kinda long (5 mins for my coffee and 15 mins for panini) and not many savory food options, this place is great for chitchats, doing some work or study (they have free WiFi and power outlets!!!), or just taking a break from whatever bothers you."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-11-05,5,Introduced to Auggie through the @NYCFilipinos network and automatically felt at home. She gives me the best treatment soon as I walk in like we've known eachother forever. Hospitality is nothing less than WONDERFUL and WELCOMING! Adobo Panini is a must and any LATTE & DESERT to top it off will have you going home like your day is COMPLETE! GO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT ASAP!
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-10-29,5,"Owned by the sweetest ladies ever. The vegan desserts at are mouthwateringly good. Cookies were soft and chewy and their specialty drinks were piping hot. The owners are SO friendly and they can create cool designs on your latte.  PLUS, the cafe's walls are  totally decked out in graffiti from floor to ceiling and they have a rack of nail polishes so you ladies can paint away while sipping a latte. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-09-30,5,"good strong coffee, the filipino baked goods are wildly delicious (had this coconut madeline-style mini cake that was heaven) and the staff is ridiculously friendly. the BEST part is they have this punch card thing where you get your 6th coffee free, but they let you keep the punch card at the shop! it's genius. new favorite neighborhood gem x"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-09-08,5,"Great little coffee shop !
Had the green tea and adobo panini !
Would love to come back again 
For sure"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-08-22,5,"I stopped by to get a drink and find a place to read. The woman working was SO kind, I asked if they had a restroom and without hesitation she let me into the bathroom marked staff only. I ordered a lemonade and it was delicious! Super fun place with super kind staff."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-08-01,5,"I like this place. The coffee is good, but what makes it special are the Filipino panini and the sweet treats. It is great to have Filipino food in the neighborhood. A very big thank you to the very friendly staff. Y'all make me smile!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-07-28,5,"Forget about the competition, Kabisera Kapé is simply far and away THE BEST!!!!!  You walk into a surround of a colorful cartoon that immediately lets you know you have come to a welcoming place.  For such a small, intimate setting, their variety of offerings is astonishing.  And it's all good, really quality prepared by a super friendly, personable staff.  No other coffee shop comes close!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-07-20,5,"This place has a super friendly owner and staff!! I LOVE COMING HERE!! The coffee, bagels, and baked goods are fresh and delish she makes gorgeous iced green tea lattes in an extravagant glass!! 
Try the vegan treats!
Avocado toast! Lots of handmade food!
Plus-they sell Jummy Crystal shades-which are super dope!!!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-07-09,5,"Have never been to a Filipino cafe and it was great. The butterscotch was so delicious and reasonably priced at a dollar. I even had the adobo panini and that was delicious.  It kind of reminded me of a Cuban sandwich, since it was filled with shredded pork and chicken with melted cheese. That was also reasonably priced at 7. 

Cannot wait to come back here again to try the coffee. My aunt had a great time and she bought a whole loaf of cake. It was a great experience and I am sure that the other items on the menu is great, as well.

Happy that they are open late!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-07-08,5,"If you are looking for a great coffee shop in the LES this is the place to be. The coffee shop walls and mural is painted with pop art by pop artist Marco. Friendly owners who practically knew every customer's name. I feel at home every time I visit this place. Try their Matchas and Red Velvet Lattes. For sandwiches their Adobo Panini is a killer!!! Oh btw, I forgot to mention free WiFi. A must visit for any coffee aficionados!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-07-01,5,I lurvvvv it!! I want to come here everyday l. Avocado panini is bomb. Real talk broooo I ain't denying I'm a straight buyer you do you don't wanna f with MEEEE
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-06-16,5,Much respect.....coffee shop reminds me of the friendliness of Manila and Amsterdam. Art work in cafe puts you in that zen like happy state. The owner always remembers your name and what you ordered . My fav drink...calamansi juice..and their  signature drink (Fung Bros YouTube video) Salamat salamat po to u and your husband
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-05-29,2,"I came here with my family for a cup of coffee after dinner, and the service was less than mediocre. First, I ordered a matcha latte and a regular latte, and the total came out to $9.50. I paid with a $20 bill but only got $10 in change, and the cashier said she would keep the 50 cents. ????? 50 cents isn't a big deal but this rubbed me the wrong way. Also, I think the shop owners' friends were visiting so they weren't giving us their full attention. I had to wait for the cashier/ barista to finish her conversation with her friend before I was able to order anything. 
I also asked for the latte art shown in the yelp photos because my mother wanted it, so I asked for it. It took each latte 10- 15 minutes to come out, and the art was nothing like the photos. 
The matcha latte, when it did come out, was so bitter and powdery that we couldn't drink it. There was so much powder that it coated our tongues. The latte was good, but not worth the wait and the bad experience. I will not be returning."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-05-28,5,"I've been coming to this Phillipino inspired cafe many times since it opened up.  It has an inviting quirky vibe and features cartoony artwork on their walls and ceilings by Peter Marco.

Their most popular drinks are the Almond Chaitado, Ube Latte, and Good Morning OJ, which I've had all of them.  The most interesting drink is the Good Morning OJ, which is a combination of espresso and orange juice, it looks really pretty because the 2 drinks don't mix.

They also serve Philippine influenced foods here, such as Adobo (pulled pork and chicken panini) and Langgonisa (sausage panini).  They were crispy and juicy when I had them.  I'm coming back for them laters.

Also ask for Latte art work, their cafe baristas have awesome skill, they can draw bunnies, cats, and anything cute you can think of.

Also, it's hysterical, but there is free nail polish for the customers to use.

If you're ever in the area, make sure you visit Kabisera for a visual and tasty experience."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-05-05,5,My favorite study spot. Very good coffee 、food、service & vibes. If u miss it~ u will regret it.
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-04-20,5,"The only thing more vibrant and charming than the cafe itself, is the owners and the people who run it!  They offer a wide variety of adventurous and innovative drinks, which range beyond just the typical cappuccino or latte.  Aside from their coffee drinks (brewed with La  Colombe), a personal favorite of mine is the Ginger Latte, which is something I never knew existed, and definitely not something I would have thought to try without recommendation.  Their paninis and breakfast sandwiches are also delicious, made fresh to order, and a great deal for the price.  The only ""downside"" is the fact that since it is small, they usually only have one or two baristas to prepare drinks as well as food.  So if you happen to really be in a hurry, I might recommend trying one of their pastries or baked goods, which are also quite tasty.  Even still, what they may occasionally lack in swiftness, they more than make up for in quality and genuine hospitality.  As such, I will bypass the Starbucks next to my apartment in favor of this little gem 11 times out of 10. Last but not least, they offer a customer loyalty card which makes every 6th drink you order FREE!!!!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-03-16,5,"Good vibes! I was immediately drawn into the decor of this cute little cafe as soon as I stepped in. The colors are very vibrant..it's almost like stepping into a cutesy children's book. One of the ladies there which I believe is the owner was super sweet and enjoyed having conversations with me and my friend. I went with the matcha latte and it was delicious! The cups seem larger than what other cafes usually offer. I also did not know that they make a majority of their bakery items, which is very cool! Will be back to try them!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-03-15,5,"Awesome coffee shop! Great vibes, very welcoming staff. The mural is very cute and colorful. Appreciate the warm and friendly atmosphere, you can tell this place is managed with a lot of love. Will definitely be returning!"
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-03-11,4,"Happened to be in east village yesterday. My friend and I stopped by this cafe. This place is very unique and cute with artsy walls and decors that complements its theme. Space is pretty tight tho- they have two tables and couple bar stools. Their menu is extensive (attached the menu although it may change). Luckily we sat at the table and ordered almond chaitado and matcha latte. The lattes were both okay, and the chaitado came in a huge cup (I still managed to finish it haha...).
I wanted to use the restroom but noticed that the restroom was inside the counter area. I didn't bother going behind the counter.
Anyone who enjoys cutesy and colorful theme should check out this place! The staffs were friendly too."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-03-10,1,"THIS CAFE HAS MICE. I did not even want to bother to write a review on yelp, but this time I had to. Kabisera Kape is cute little cafe, it looks organized and neat, but there are many problems with the coffee too. I came here about twice while passing through Allen st. I drink latte from many different locations, and this place seems to not know the different between cappuccino and latte. Temperature is often too hot, but steamed milk shouldn't be too hot because it kills the flavor. The owner lady talks a bit too much to the customers when there is other customers waiting on line.

The problem is, while using the bathroom, you have to go through the counter and I saw a MOUSE. It was clearly a mouse next to a fridge looking machine. This is not okay in any condition."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-03-02,5,What an awesome place! The best latte art in all of New York!  I love it when the proprietors of local business pour their love and skill in what they do! You can taste the goodness in the food!
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-02-17,1,"I love a good cup of coffee and based on the signs outside was looking forward to a nice big hot cup of joe. Unfortunately I never got the opportunity as I decided to take my money elsewhere. Upon walking into the practically empty shop, I saw 2 people behind the counter, one on food (I'm assuming) and the barista. Some guy (customer, owner, idk) was there chatting with them, but after I was greeted by the barista (who made it seem like she didn't realize I was there although I was the ONLY one waiting to be served) I assumed I would be asked what I wanted. Nope. Instead, she continues to have a conversation with this guy as I'm standing there waiting. Having been a waitress and barista myself in the past, this is not good customer service. You don't make a customer wait for you to finish YOUR conversation... I was given the notion based on her rudeness that she didn't care for my business and I will not be recommending this place to others."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-02-12,5,"Such a lovely little cafe! Just opened at the end of December. Came at 7pm on Monday and was impressed with the store-wide art/murals! Lots of unique tea and coffee choices. Wonderful atmosphere - pretty calm and decent prices. Sadly no bathroom. Since whynot closed, this is a great alternative coffee shop with WiFi, snacks and chill vibe."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-02-11,5,Excellent! Was trying to find a place for my friend to use the restroom. The guy working was so nice about letting me buy a coffee so she could use it. The coffee was great too! Will stop in again for coffee next time I'm in the area!
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-02-11,5,This is probably my favorite cafe in the lower east side. The workers are all very friendly and nice and the coffee is amazing. It's also for a very good price! The art on the walls make it so unique. They also sell pastries and cakes. This place is very good. 5/5 stars
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-02-10,5,"Perfect spot to get tasty coffee and also enjoy Marco art, definitely come back again. If you like real coffee or chai latte taste then the place to check out."
2,kabisera-new-york-2,2018-02-06,4,"Any neighborhood should enthusiastically welcome a coffee shop that's adorned with art and slinging La Colombe! Kabisera Kapé is a warm and inviting space with lovely staff that serves a solid cappuccino. All of the wall space is a punderful coffee-themed mural by Marco Art (@marcoartnyc), which is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. The cat latte art is specific to a few employees, but all are being trained so you don't miss out on an instagramable moment. Kapé is worth patronizing at least once, even just to enjoy the fun, little ambiance."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2020-02-24,5,"I always order pickup from Yelp to skip the super long line that goes all the way outside the shop along the block for this tiny, to-go-focused cafe. Their market plate is healthy AND delicious. I haven't been too impressed by their entrees (tried chicken, steak and salmon) but the quinoa kale salad (mostly quinoa) with goat cheese is to die for. I didn't even know I liked quinoa before. ALL of their bakery items are tasty. My favorite is the canele and the jam scone (after they stopped serving canele.) The bakery items are the only reason I'd wait in line for 15 minutes during lunchtime on a cold windy weekday, since the items change by the day and aren't all listed in the pickup menu online. SMILE TO GO PLEASE CHANGE THIS AND ADD MORE BAKERY ITEMS TO YOUR YELP PICKUP ORDER OPTIONS."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2020-01-20,5,"I work around the block and frequent smile to go for my morning coffee. On a particularly busy morning, I was happily surprised by the amazing customer I received. Jo was happy to take the time to help me decide on my new americano order that morning despite the lengthy line behind me. I did not feel rushed at all. Today I went back in the afternoon and again, great customer service. Decent customer service is hard to come by in  Manhattan, and exceptional customer service is a rarity. I definitely recommend smile to go for that personal corner coffee shop experience!"
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2019-10-11,5,"Delicious and inventive entrees and mixed salads. Either take out or eat in.
The salads are stellar and unusual.
The hot food is also excellent. Almost all of their offerings are health conscious and relatively low cal.
That said, their sweets look yummy.
The price is also right.
I stop here to bring home a meal for lunch or dinner and am always pleasantly surprised."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2019-09-12,4,Love this place. I grabbed a healthy lunch to go to eat in the office. The line was so long and stretched out to the street but it moved quickly. A staff will ask your order in advance so your foods are ready to be picked up when you reach to the casher. All foods are freshly made. I want to try all the menus!
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2019-09-02,4,"Love the market plate from Smile to Go - they always have the type of healthy, delicious seasonal veggies and grains that I want to be eating! This location is tiny and can get really packed, but the line moves quickly. If it's nice out, the move is to eat outside on the long stoop a few steps away. If you're craving a sweet treat, the brown butter rice krispie treat is truly incredible. It has ruined me for other rice krispies. I also enjoy the bone broth here and the fig and manouri cheese sandwich, but the prices for both are a bit criminal."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2019-08-30,5,"my favorite lunch spot in NYC. I was heartbroken with I got a new job that was no longer across the street from Smile. Fresh, healthy ingredients that you can trust. You can actually taste the love in their dishes."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2019-08-23,3,"This was my favorite lunch spot during the week, have been coming at least 3x a week to get a healthy side and grilled chicken. Unfortunately, they have decided to save money and switch their source of chicken from lean chicken breast to fatty chicken thigh. I have provided the feedback to the staff and hope they will revert this change."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2019-08-02,2,"The food is good and over priced. The service is lacking for these basic reasons: 1) MUSIC IS TOO LOUD and Cashier and help behind the counter cannot hear order as placed. 2) Counter is TOO HIGH so help cannot even read your lips when you place order. They have clearly outgrown this space, at least they can install some acoustical tile, and get a more appropriate height counter."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2019-07-11,3,"5 stars for the food! 2 stars for the service. Would it KILL the employees to be less snobby? You work at a scoop-and-go take-out lunch spot, so I think not. (Go for the market plate with the three items - great vegetarian options and decently priced.)"
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2019-06-19,5,"Some of the nicest (but not pushy or fake) staff at any coffee-adjacent place in the city. Coffee is above par and the atmosphere is very ""I'm on my lunch break from my start-up office in SOHO"". Imagine if a really good Panera bread was run by one of the chefs from Munchies on Vice."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2019-05-09,3,The food quality was good. I got the potato leak soup and half a sandwich. Small portion for around $15. Not an everyday lunch spot but a once a week treat
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2019-05-01,2,"$14 for a small ham and cheese sandwich and two tiny pickles, what a freaking rip off. The sandwich wasn't ""artisan"", ""creative"", or ""unique"" in any way. It was just a normal sandwich that you'd typically get at any NYC deli for $6.50 or less. 

I'm only giving it two stars because it looks like this place may be more well known for its coffee or other food items. Don't order their sandwiches, ever."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2019-04-09,5,"I just had this place deliver bone broth and carrot lemongrass soups and I am thrilled!  Both came w a side of crushed ginger I added as a side. Both came hot, flavorful, perfect, timely, delivery gentleman was super sweet. 
I definitely love this place, and hope to visit it in the future. I will definitely be ordering from them a lot!  Strongly recommend. 
I still taste the ginger in my mouth and I'm smiling, yo!"
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-11-04,4,"This was the first time I'd ever had steel-cut oats (I know. I'm late to the game) and it was life-changing. I've since tried to make my own and can't make it taste as good as Smile To Go's. It would seem like a simple  recipe, but theirs is so filling and delicious. My sister and I got a bunch of things to eat, including a quinoa banana bread which was divine, and an egg sandwich, which were also very good. I wouldn't hesitate to go back for breakfast items if I found myself in Soho again."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-10-10,1,"I have been going to this location for years. At first I was happy with the quality of their food. Lately I have been extremely disappointed every single time I purchase from The Smile. The rotisserie chicken ($16) is consistently dry and cold, the sides are underwhelming and tasteless. Today I ordered a bone broth, it was neon yellow with an inch of oil floating on top - disgusting. The food I am receiving is unacceptable for the prices I am paying and unfortunately it's not what it used to be. A tiny egg sandwich on an English muffin costs over $7. It's not worth it, at all."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-10-05,4,"People that work around here comes here alot they packed everyday. Pricey, but healthy choice. The coffee is great too."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-09-28,3,"For a $9 breakfast burrito, one would at least expect it to be warm. I really don't know how they get away with it.. 

On the good side, their roasted chicken and pastries are good, but if you stop by for lunch, keep in mind you'll be paying as much as if you had gone to a sit down restaurant."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-08-17,3,"The first time I went there, I ordered an Iced Chai w/oat milk. Not that good; the chai was very watered down and could barely taste the Chai. I figured it wasn't fair to base my experience one one coffee, so I tried another and was very disappointed."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-08-11,3,$4.35 for an ok if not particularly inspired salty chocolate chip cookie. Small space inside so don't come with a large group. Lots of sandwiches and sides along with pastries. Overall very meh.
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-07-25,5,"Obsessed. This makes me smile all day. Thinking about what I am going to order, the act of ordering, eating, and my feeling after I have eaten. There could not be a more appropriate name. 

Interesting concept- its like a hipster version of a bakery/dig inn, with a constantly changing menu, and very interesting, exciting, odd combinations that work deliciously. Every time I have been, theres several different options ranging from a pesto pasta, chickpea salad, Cesar 
 salad, roast kale or veggies, beet salad, quinoa salad... all with crazy combinations of spices, flavors, veggies, dressings. I've never seen anything like it but it always gets me excited to come back. They also offer several sandwiches, as well as proteins to add to your salads. You can choose 1 or 2 salad combos, but most of the time I want to try all! 

The best kept secret here is their chocolate chip sea salt cookie. It is so far, the best one that I have had in NYC, and I don't like to admit but I get it for all meals of the day, far too frequently. It is worth every dollar, every calorie, and every minute you may have to wait."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-06-25,5,Service is lovely with helpful people. Food is amazing and well priced. The coffee is always good and the food is well priced for the neighborhood.
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-06-05,2,Asked the big guy in the blue shirt for a bag for my purchase and he reacted like i had requested ownership of his first born !  Strange place. Food is good. Can do without the Attitude.
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-05-08,4,"It's not cheap but it's really good....I love the turkey sandwich, vegetable sides, and salad-ish combos you can order by portion. The coffee is only decent and is pretty pricy so unless you're pressed for a coffee--probably a better idea to walk a block to La Colombe at Saturdays Surf if you're going to spend that kind of money. However, the real gem of this place (aside from location and convenience) is this delicious olive oil loaf cake with hibiscus icing. Truly one of the most perfectly baked (not too sweet, soft crumb but not spongey) baked goods I've had in the city."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-04-30,3,"A quick bite near our hotel.

Service friendly and quick.

What they do well are coffee and salads. Iced teas at $4 a pop I assume are standard fare in this neighborhood.

The $6.50 turkey and Swiss sandwich was two bites.

Damages with tip was $25."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-04-08,1,this food is so insanely overpriced. can't even enjoy the chicken and potatoes i just got because it was almost $17... and the potatoes were cold. price also does not add up with the portion. save yourself the disappointment and go to a sit down restaurant for the same price
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-02-21,5,"This place had the best banana bread I had in my entire life. It was SOO good it was bad, because I'll never look at banana bread the same way again."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-02-12,5,Their rice crispy treats are CRACK. But seriously. All the food is amazing but I'm honestly here for the pastries and balancing it out with roasted carrots
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2018-01-05,4,"The food here is yummy, but it's about 50% more expensive than you'd expect for the portion size. Even the fancy, overpriced, salad places in the area are cheaper, and this place is only a few blocks from Chinatown! If you walk a few blocks east, you can get a similar serving of food for one-third the price."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-12-28,4,"I was staying across the street at Howard 11 and came into this little shop for my caffeine fix. I really enjoyed the drip coffee and while small, the cafe is cute and clean inside. While waiting for my coffee I noticed chefs cooking up what looked like crispy, roasted chicken that smelled divine. After doing a little shopping I came back for that chicken. For $14, I got the meal of chicken (a good 1/4 lb size) and two sides of shaved Brussels sprouts and broccoli. Packed it to go and also bought one of their loaves to enjoy for dessert after my pretty healthy lunch. Overall the meal was really tasty, highly enjoyed the chicken. The sides were fresh although needed salt. Prices are a bit high. I really enjoyed my coffee cake, very moist. Would come again if I'm looking for a filling and healthy lunch option."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-11-21,4,"Smile To Go is part of The Smile restaurant. STG often has long lunchlines on weekdays. It's a small, friendly take-out place that serves great sandwiches, salads, soups, desserts, coffee and tea."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-11-15,4,"Love this place! They have excellent coffee and great vegan and gluten-free baked goods. What a treat! It's just a cross the street from our favorite hotel, 11 Howard. We went over to Smile To Go every morning and afternoon of our stay. The people working there are very nice and helpful. Great place."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-10-22,3,"Overpriced , lines are hella long every time I go in the weekends in the mornings worst time to go in service super slow .. btw the cookies weren't all that .. wouldn't go out my way to come here"
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-10-09,5,"YUMMIEST chocolate chip cookie! Shopped @ Reformation and then got some yummy rotisserie chicken and this cookie changed my life, let me tell u. def coming back next time Im in  NYC!"
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-10-05,2,"I'd been hearing about this place for a long time. I heard the food is great....  Well, I finally went down to Howard Street to visit and I was unimpressed.  My salad was fresh and tasty, but the service was unfriendly.  It wasn't that busy when I went., so I don't know where the attitude arrived from.  

The chocolate chip, which was recommended because I love them soooo much, but the cookie here was OK, a little bland, in fact.  I also think it was overpriced.  

 I wouldn't say this place is awful, but I would not go out of my way to re-visit."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-08-28,5,"Delicious! Very hip and trendy cafe with minimal seating indoors. I was told the rotisserie chicken is a popular item, so I got that with a side of arugula with feta and watermelon. The flavor of the chicken was great. The skin was nice and crispy. The arugula was perfect, just enough dressing on it, and the watermelon chunks inside the salad were huge. The prices are up there, over $14 for lunch. I would definitely consider coming more often if the prices were a bit lower. Other than that, it was great."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-08-06,4,This was across from New York Pilates and I stopped in after taking class this week.  YUM!  Lots of gluten-free options for baked goods.  I had the lemon zest coconut bread and it was delish.  I also got some of their peanut butter/oat energy bars.  SO good!
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-07-31,3,"Food is really good, menu is always on point. Coffee is pretty good as well. Employees however tend to be unaccommodating  and rude. I'm a regular here since I work right above the space and would expect employees to be a bit more accommodating considering I'm here basically every day."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-07-07,3,"I would give 5 stars for the food, but I knock you down for the shitty attitude of SOME of your employees. Most of the time they are nice and patient, but this week - no line - I get pretty much yelled at by the person scooping the food. Look, people choose visually, and your stuff is sometimes hard to match the description of to the food. Sometimes farro salad looks like israeli cous cous. SO, please either label the food in the cases so I always know exactly what to ask for, or tell your staff to be a LOT less rude when I have to point. Also, there were only three things to choose from, and when I say I will have the same as the last person, whose food was just scooped three seconds ago, instead of trying to look at the board to determine what exactly I am ordering, one would think that it is not an unreasonable request. Apparently it was, so I said the one on the far right, and that seemed to work. Who is in charge? Maybe this person was just tired, but someone should have noticed that they were starting to lose patience with customers and switched them out."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-06-18,4,Staff is always friendly. Chocolate chip cookies and Arnold Palmer are always perfect. Prepared foods could use more salt and overall taste.
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-06-10,4,"Lemonade was not too sweet, ham & gruyere sandwich hit the spot and strawberry and almond bread was amazing!"
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-06-10,2,So overpriced and food taste like its microwaveable. It's trendy for sure but I don't get why
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-05-08,5,Love this little spot for great gourmet sandwiches and premade salads on the go! Also the best latte I've ever had!
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-05-03,2,Waited on line for 15 minutes and they didn't have the decency to let everyone know that they basically had nothing left. If you're a passive hippie vegan that doesn't mind horrible service just to get your $18 market sides then this may be your place.
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-04-29,5,You guys catered a lunch for a shoot I was working on at Milk Studios and your LACE COOKIES are THE BEST I EVER HAD!!!!! They just melted in my mouth #Yum
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-04-15,5,"Fresh food and tasty. 
Perfect for a stop in soho. 
5 stars
Fennel and mozzarella is my favorite."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-03-30,5,This quaint small takeout joint had one of the best sandwiches ever!! It had a nice grain bread with minouri cheese truffle pear and amazing fig jam! Each bite was an explosion of flavor! I tried a salad and and a coffee cake that was good as well. But this sandwich in particular hit the spot!!!
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-03-16,5,"Honestly, I'm in love with Smile not only because of its proximity to the office.. but also the food. Although the food selection may seem normal (such as salmon, salads, sandwiches), the ingredients paired in each selection is actually quite unique. For example: it's chicken salad sandwich contains cranberries and it actually taste delicious! I was skeptical about it but nope: I love it! I also recently fell in love with their breakfast menu, especially the frittata & the granola with fruit. I already cannot wait for tomorrow morning to get some more breakfast from them."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-01-31,1,"I pass this place some mornings on my way to work and decided to stop in and get my morning coffee here. The young woman working the counter was cold, she didn't say ""next customer, good morning, what can I get for ya"" or anything for that matter; she just stared at me like i pissed her off. I asked for a large Iced coffee which is about a dollar more than a regular size and all their cup sizes for iced coffees is the same; why am I paying extra money for a large when there isn't a difference in cup size? Overall I think the place had a good vibe but I will not be going back."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2017-01-16,3,"Pros: 
-Healthy, decent lunch food
-Nice, accommodating employees

Cons:
-Overpriced food
-Slow (pace-wise) employees

I work in SoHo. Just north of Canal street, to be more exact. My point in saying this is not to enable any stalkers but more to paint a picture of how bleak the lunch landscape is for me. Though SoHo is far more pleasant than Midtown, it's pretty barren when it comes to food options (I should say *relatively* barren--in any other city, such standards would likely leave you famished pretty consistently). Not a lot of weekday foot traffic there. Anyway, Smile To Go is one of the few takeout lunch spots in the area, and it also happens to offer a number of healthy menu items. So I end up there often. I went back and forth between three and four stars for this rating because both the food and the people mean well. But price and efficiency are things I give weight to when rating businesses, so I'm going with three. If the world was a fair place (hyperbole alert), 3.5 stars would be a Yelp option. For today, three it is. 

Smile To Go is small and assuming. Given that SoHo is mostly populated with high-end shops, it's pretty easy to miss. Not totally inconspicuous, though, because there's often a line of hungry humans trickling out the door during lunch hours. As I said, there's not much in terms of healthy takeout around here. At first I thought the line was due to limited options and/or how great the food must be here. I later learned that:
a) the space itself is tiny--not much room for any sort of line
b) the service is painfully slow

It hurts a bit to bash the service because the people who work here really are nice. But given that half of the orders are pre-made salads, I'm honestly not too sure why this place gets so backed up. They seem to be overwhelmed with orders at all times. Hence the line out the door. What I order takes all of 20 seconds to prepare, so it's pretty frustrating when I need to wait 15 minutes in that teeny tiny space (after ordering *and* paying, for that matter) for my food. I get that there's some NYC impatience here, but considering the product, it simply shouldn't take this long.

Food-wise, Smile To Go offers a bunch of yummy, healthy options. Salads (all pre-made), sandwiches, soups, and proteins. Also plenty of baked goods, most being gluten-free/vegan. Being the health nut that I am, I typically order the salads. You have the option of ordering one, two or three salads or getting rotisserie chicken + one side. Everything else is extra. Given that all sides are veggies, I need to get three. Not filling enough, otherwise. Sides I have gotten: cauliflower w/ olives, quinoa (usually mixed w/ some kind of cheese, nuts, sometimes mushrooms), kale salad (w/ pomegranate seeds and sweet potatoes), carrots, collard greens, shaved brussels sprouts. All are fairly fresh, though they are sitting out in the display case (refilled often, though). My main gripe about the food is the price. Three vegetable sides, with tax, is over $14. I get that all of this is healthy and trust me, I really do value that. But $14 is just not cool. Getting that chicken + one side is something like $12, and it's really not that much food. Considering the quality (consistently good, but not standout), it just doesn't match up. But like I said, 3.5 seems more apt than 3. Three feels unfair, but four is false advertising. So here we are. 

Just to reiterate, Smile to Go is a very solid lunch option in east SoHo. Definitely check it out. Just not if you're trying to save money...or time."

I always leave spending about $14 for lunch and sit down to eat and the portions are just way too small. I'm always hungry

The egg sandwich they sell in the morning is great, but $6.50 for a room temp premade egg sandwich. Come on :("
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2016-09-21,3,"Been stoping by for their egg sandwiches (they are the best) + their energy balls are very yummy and tasteful.
It's just that the staff aren't friendly and barely smiles... So if it's (Smile to go) then only your food makes me smile nothing else."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2016-09-19,4,"Smile To Go shares some pretty similar DNA of other coffee shops you've probably been to around Lower Manhattan. Coffee drinks, nice foodstuffs, etc... But boy, if there's one thing they do really well, it's their delicious sweet corn muffin. I've heard great things about their cookies, and they make some seriously addictive rosemary and maple cashews, but this sweet corn muffin is one of the best pastries you'll have anywhere in the city. If you stop here for anything, you should consider tossing that in your bag for the road. 

They do tend to draw an attractive crowd with the occasional celeb sighting if that's your thing. Seeing Jonah Hill crush a baked good on the outside stairs is something everyone should witness at least once in their lives."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2016-09-16,1,"I think the owners are starting to get greedy.  After the renovation, portion sizes have decreased by 30%.  The sandwiches are dismal for what you pay for.  There used to be a lot of chicken in the Chicken Sandwich but now you wonder what has happened.  The Kale salad portion is so small, a chicken would still be starving afterwards.  
Going downhill guys......  Prices dont match up as well.  The portion boxes have a price and the board on the wall have another price.. Sad face to go"
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2016-08-29,4,"When I used to work in SoHo, I enjoyed taking routinely walks around the neighborhood during my lunch break. Many high end stores and small cafes are often hidden, such as Smile To Go. However, the key indicator of a trendy spot is when you see hipster millennial's loitering in one spot. Yes, this is how I discovered Smile To Go.

As I had already eaten lunch, I decided to try one of the giant cookies displayed by the registered. One bite out of the chocolate chip sea salt cookie and I almost began to tear up. Not only was it a beauty to look at, but it was as delicious as it's hyped to be. I highly recommend it!!"
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2016-08-09,2,No. Just no. I paid $10 for a small HALF of a turkey sandwich and small cold brew. Annnnnd scene.
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2016-08-05,3,"I go here a lot because it is one of the only lunch places near my office. It is good, often crowded and they run out of things a lot, so don't get your heart set on anything! Generally their kale and quinoa dishes are very good. As is their Buckwheat Bananabread. And the sea salt chocolate chip cookie. And the Turkey sandwich... Ok, basically everything's good! Nothing is really like something to write home about, but its pretty tasty. 

However, the price for what you're getting is veryyyy expensive, even for the neighborhood. And maybe 1 out of every 6 employees is friendly. The rest are kind of affected/stone cold. However, that seems to be the general vibe of the neighborhood and honestly, it's usually a little packed in there, so it makes sense."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2016-06-03,1,"Unfortunately, this location is the sad step-sister to The Smile on Bond st. Here, you get a tiny portion of limp, unseasoned vegetables for $10. Rude staff; not good value or taste. There's way better options in soho than Smile to Go."
3,smile-to-go-new-york-2,2016-06-01,4,That sea salt chocolate chip cookie is heaven! I really like their breakfast egg sandwich. It's filling and yummy. Otherwise the portions are small but all the food is great like the quishe.

7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-12-30,5,Loved this little coffee shop! The owners/workers had a lot of energy with loud music and fun decor. 5 stars mostly for the experience/ambiance. Everything on the menu is what I would be interested in for coffee and small bites. I had the vanilla latte 2 days in a row.
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-12-10,4,"I'm a fan of this place. It is small, but I find it to be cozy. The baristas are also nice here. I like that they are connected to Ritual so I can just order my coffee in advance and have it ready on the go. Sometimes, I hang out here before work. I suppose I can understand why other people find it uncomfortable because the place is small and sometimes more people come in certain times of day.

I get the matcha latte and a regular latte. I think the big part of the reason is the latte art. I like the way they make their latte since I don't find it too sweet. It is hot and velvety just how I like it. 

I love that it is conveniently located by a subway station!"

The honey enjoyed his coffee, but I would have loved more comfortable seating and outlets. It wasn't a great place to chill for awhile as there wasn't a plug near some of the tables and while they has a few tiny pillows the seating was wooden and hard.

For people who are just picking up coffee, this is probably fine - but we were looking for what the name implied and this just wasn't our jam."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-10-09,4,"I popped in for some coffee, it was very lovely. The service was great, I was served promptly and with a smile. 

This is a smaller joint, with just a few chairs for around 5 guests but has a nice chill coffee house environment.
It is great because it is right next to the train, very convenient. 

I also tried the bagel with cream cheese, it was standard. 
I'd come back again if I needed a cup of coffee in the neighborhood. 

4.2/5"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-09-29,5,"Super SUPER cute little coffee shop! They don't burn their milk for their lattes which I appreciate and they don't allow laptops on the weekends (pros and cons to that but I think I love it). Yummy coffee, and cute vibes!"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-09-27,5,LOVE this Coffee Shop! The owner and staff always deliver excellent coffee and fresh food Highly recommend this warm cozy place !
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-09-04,5,"I stayed 5 days in NY and I was there every morning . They serve Devoción coffee ,it's very creamy and delicious. Not bitter ,medium roast . EverythingI I ate was so delicious. Bagel with cream cheese and tomato with  arugula was one of favorite . Nutella Croissant is so yummy, almond croissant was very richly. Home made Blueberry muffin was very tasty. They baked in house so always fresh . Staff is very friendly,they know what you like at make it ready before you order . Small coffee shop , it's busy in the morning but they are fast ."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-08-22,5,"We stayed at a hotel nearby and unfortunately didn't discover this coffee shop until our last day. The coffee and pastries were delicious, and the ambiance is comfortable and serene. Staff were very nice. Their llama logo is really cute!"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-08-08,5,This place is so cute! The Nutella croissant is what I will be returning for. Get it Nutella Croissant! It. Is. So. Good. Very friendly barista. She was very welcoming and they have great quality coffee.
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-07-30,5,"My favorite coffee shop in EV
Their coffee is so good and pastries freshly baked every morning. I know that Oya , the owner and the sweetest and nicest person I've ever met , baking everything every day at 4am HERSELF. What a love and commitment to the business and first of all to the customers.
Come and try their delicious cold brew and freshly baked blueberry muffins , you won't regret a single bite !"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-07-22,4,"I have a bias about this place from the start I'm a huge lover of all things llama. The service here was wonderful. The staff were really knowledgeable about the coffee and how to brew it to bring out the robust flavors. I learned a lot during my visit the atmosphere is chill, relaxed, & llamas everywhere . I had the pour over coffee with a chocolate croissant. I usually need to add tons of sugar and cream- I ended up drinking it with a splash of cream and one packet of raw sugar- it was delicious. The croissant was yummy. I gave this place 4 stars because I feel the prices are just a bit too high. For two chocolate croissants and two small cups of pour over coffee it was $18.75 give or take some change that. To me that cost is excessive. Overall fun place to stop in and get your llama & coffee fix. I wish they had a real llama outside to greet you. **Hint hint ** lol."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-07-08,5,"Great food, coffee and service! Had an avocado bagel and some coffee. The guy behind the counter was efficient and sweet."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-06-24,5,Such a lovely little cafe! The barista was so so sweet and their coffee was incredible. Can't wait to pop back in for a relaxing afternoon sipping on their iced lattes and reading a book by the window.
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-06-16,1,"I used to come to this place years ago when it was called blue bird...it was an amazing shop. I had a meeting by there today and was excited to get a coffee. When I got there I learned that the name/ownership changed. I saw they were using Devocion coffee so I figured it would still be great. 
I ordered 3 flat whites, for my friends and I. I could see as the barista was making them that she was inexperienced. I could tell by her tamp and other things but I hoped for the best. I had asked ""for here"" and the first two came out on paper cups. That was annoying so I told her put the third in a proper cup. She said she didn't have enough cups and that's why she did that. (Not sure how they could only have 1 cappuccino cup) Then I got my cappuccino and it was SCORCHING hot and bitter. Really poorly executed. I told her it was too hot (and to avoid another bad coffee) just wanted a cold brew instead. She said ""no, but I can remake this for you"". I didn't want to be rude so I said ok. She remade it and again it was too hot to drink. She was also using a spoon to separate the foam and micro foam which made it clear that she didn't know what she was doing. In convo she mentioned that she had only been there a month. Anyway, the new coffee wasn't any better so I just left it and walked out. Very disappointing experience. Hopefully the owner reads this and makes sure that all of his baristas are properly trained, in coffee and service because right now it's not the case. You're a specialty coffee shop on the EV for Christ sakes. If I can't get a good coffee there, it's a problem.
Excellent croissant btw!!"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-05-21,2,"I had high hopes for this place as the other reviews seemed good, but I actually found their espresso to be extremely bitter. I ordered my espresso the way I normally drink it and the women helping me continuously argued with me telling me that's not the right way to do it...beats me."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-04-21,4,"Small cafe with three small tables, setup is simple and nice with open windows and outdoor seating facing a quiet street and park, good for people watching. Feels European to me which I like; this doesn't have a commercial feel at all. 

No laptops at the tables on weekends but fine for the high seats at window. 

Matcha latte with oat milk is really good. It's not sweetened and I would def get it again here. Also had the small egg and cheese focaccia sandwich which was heated in the microwave. I won't get that again."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-04-09,5,"Great staff, great coffee, great pastries...GREAT chocolate chip cookies. This is my go to coffee spot in the neighborhood and I frequent Lazy Llama on the go or to work out of."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-04-07,5,"Such a cute hole in a wall spot for a yummy coffee! 
Love their cold brew with some OAT milk! 
The staff is so nice and welcoming as well 
They have some pastries and sandwiches if you are hungry! Check it out if you are in the area :)"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-03-15,5,This is a great little coffee shop in the East Village right by the F stop. Their espresso drinks are delicious and have a variety of milk options. I constantly inhale their croissants and they make croissant and bagel sandwiches as well. The shop is small and wonderfully comfortable. The staff is so lovely and charming. Definitely recommend. It's my go-to coffee shop in the area.
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-03-14,5,"This is an excellent little coffee shop. Next time I go, I'll take pictures and add them to this review, because the space is adorable and warm and classy.

The service was the most memorable, both of the baristas were so kind and authentically so. It wasn't some sort of fake ""customer service"" gimmick, and that makes such a huge difference. 

The coffee was also perfection, the foam was velvety and light on the latte I ordered. I will definitely be making this place a routine stop."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-02-12,4,"The decor at this place is the best. Full stop. 

Coffee was fine (I got an iced flat white) and an egg and cheese! Again food was fine but came on an adorable wood platter thing. I think my egg sandwich was hard boiled which is kind of strange but anyway. 

Just come for all the llamas. Because they are everywhere. Even on the coffee sleeves!"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-01-26,5,"They serve Turkish coffee!  Service is amazing!  CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE IS THE BEST ON THE PLANET!!!!! I cannot wait to come back here when I return to NYC.  The place is on the small side and might seat about 10 people, but I think that is part of the charm.

Also, how can you be mad about a place that has a LLAMA as a logo???"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2019-01-14,5,Friendly staff! Famous coffee and the crazy beautiful avocado bread!! It is definitely worth a try! ‍
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-12-24,5,"For such a cozy spot you can choose from a very wide selection of coffees, teas and treats.  It's right by the entrance to the subway so a perfect spot to grab a cup if you're coming or going."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-12-23,5,"The Lazy Llama... The coffee shop owned by such a sweet lady!!! 

Coffee shop has a huge selection of coffees and such a great and  warm environment... I loved it. 

I was full of food I couldn't have it, but their breakfast sandwich looking awesome. Also bakery selection, muffins bagels and more so yummy... 

I highly recommend this place. Feels like having a cup coffee at home"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-12-15,5,"I took my boyfriend here and he was obsessed! We both ordered iced vanilla lattes. They serve Devocion coffee here, but both my boyfriend and I agree that Lazy Llama tastes better than Devocion itself! They have fancy high quality farm fresh coffee and a few syrup choices making it my favorite combo."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-10-16,5,"It's a small but very cozy coffee shop .presentation of the foods was so good . Taste was delicious too . We ordered avocado toast , mozzarella sandwich and parfait . All of them was so yummy . Their coffee is best of the neighborhood they make art for each one . Thank you Lazy Llama for friendly service and home made cookies"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-10-14,5,Conveniently located near the 2nd Ave F train station is this cute cafe! The interior has an exposed brick wall which gives the place a nice cozy vibe. Additionally it is nicely decorated with llama pillows and decor. The staff here is welcoming and the service here is quick. They have an extensive menu so there is a drink/ food item for everyone. I got the latte and it's definitely better than your standard latte. So happy I discovered this place and I'll be coming back whenever I need a caffeine pick me up!
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-10-03,5,"I love this place and I come here every morning. The staff here is so warm and friendly, and the food and coffee are just delicious. The oat milk latte is my favorite drink here. They are always so nice and kind to me and I have never even had to second guess my choices. Consistently wonderful!!"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-09-08,5,"A very charming coffeehouse with good location on edge of LES and east village. The seating is great for a smaller cafe, as it's chic and comfortable, including a nice sidewalk seating area. The coffee is on point; try the turmeric-infused Golden latte for something different. Finally, the owner is very friendly; refreshing in a nyc-cafe culture that can be snobbish and cold. Recommended!"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-08-21,3,"Cozy, well-located coffee shop next to 2nd Avenue subway stop. I used to frequent Lazy Llama quite a bit, but have recently found that the coffee is lacking (particularly the iced coffee, which is indiscernible from deli coffee this morning.) 

They don't place the milk out on the counter (totally fine if it's for refrigeration reasons, but it's not refrigerated behind the counter either), and even after getting the coffee with room, you have to ask again for the milk.

If it's warm out or you're on the go, I would opt for Mudshop (located in the small park nearby) instead."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-08-11,3,Not thoroughly impressed with this place. Their coffee wasn't that great and they definitely forgot to make my sandwich. I waited an extra 30 minutes for my breakfast sandwich(since they kept forgetting to heat it up) and it didn't taste good at all.
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-08-05,5,"My daughter loves llamas so we had to check this place out while in NY. Saw the llama coffee mugs for sale but they were out of stock, they told me to come next week but I told them we were visiting and leaving the next day. They offered us the display mug and we accepted. Thank you, it made my daughter very happy. She very much enjoyed her ham and cheese croissant and hot chocolate. We will be back."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-07-17,5,"Great little coffee shop. Delicious ice coffee, fresh bagel with the right amount of chew, comfy seating. Super nice staff, it's hot out and I went back in after running a work errand and they gave me more ice for my melting ice coffee."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-07-13,5,"I found this place walking from my hotel to a conference site and returned each day for their cortado. It is created just like the ones I had in Spain. And, they use one of my favorite coffees: Stumptown! Definitely visit if you are nearby."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-07-06,5,"I love Llamas and was so excited to see that there was a Llama themed coffee shop in NYC! Once you walk-in, you'll notice all the Llama decor including the cup holders, pillows, and stickers. This place is a definitely a dream come true for any llama fanatic out there!

The drinks here definitely got the job done and gave me the perfect amount of energy needed to conquer a full day of walking in New York. The Iced Vanilla Latte with Soy Milk was quite refreshing and really helped me cool down from the crazy heat wave! 

The barista was also super friendly and gave me a Llama sticker, which is permanently placed on my water bottle. :)"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-06-13,5,"Amazing coffee shop. So cute and cozy, with a full delicious menu. Come here and enjoy."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-06-05,5,"Stumbling on The Lazy Llama was a super happy accident.  When you've been up riding bikes through the city since sunrise you're waiting for the bagel shop to open, you find yourself needing caffeine and then you find yourself right in front of The Lazy Llama it becomes apparent that all of the stars have aligned perfectly and you are right where you need to be in life.  This is a really cute little neighborhood shop.  My cortado was perfection and the barista was really friendly, which is always appreciated before I've had my morning coffee. This is the kind of place that I could easily see becoming part of my daily routine if I lived in the area.  :)"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-05-15,5,"Ladies love Lazy Llama. I go here almost every Wednesday before an appointment in the neighborhood. Cozy space, warm, welcoming and kind staff, delicious hot and cold beverages and they offer oat milk,  which for me is a g-dsend. Only thing sad is that it closes a bit earlier than I'd like. But hey even llamas have lives."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-05-07,3,Coffee is pretty good. But have twice gotten coffee that was Luke warm at best. Won't be going back
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-05-02,4,"First of all, I'm in love with the name of the coffee bar. I'd been wanting to try this place for a while now.
It's small and charming and great for a cozy coffee date.
I ordered an iced hazelnut vanilla latte with almond milk. I understand charging extra for almond milk (75 cents), but charging 50 cents for ice was surprising and a bit alarming. Usually there isn't a price difference between hot or cold coffee beverages. It was a hot day, so that's why I went for the iced beverage. 
Overall, the iced latte was delicious and the staff was friendly and helpful. I think it would be great if they had a rewards punch hole card type thing for every visit."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-04-07,3,"Ordered a cappuccino and the male barista made me a flat white. I told him i would drink it but reminded him that I ordered a cappuccino. He quickly scolded me and told me flat whites and cappuccinos are ""the same thing""....no they aren't actually. Tasty flat white but still...."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-04-02,4,"This is not a standard coffe shop, this sells real coffe. It is serve on the right temperature to drink it in the same moment. The baristas are really good. The price is normal"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-01-27,5,Came here randomly on a Saturday afternoon for a latte and desert. Guy behind the counter was super friendly and my latte was super good! The place is small with limited seating but we were lucky enough to get seats and chill for a bit. Only bad part is there doesn't seem to be a bathroom for customers. This is a good spot to get something quick or to go.
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2018-01-04,4,"Its a lovely coffee shop! Had regular drip coffee...scones were tempting.It was a very pleasant experience - found a spot to sit, catch up with friend and never felt like people were on top of each other. Right around the subway stop too. It will be my go-to grab and go coffee shop next time in the neighborhood!"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-11-07,3,"I suspect/hope my experience there wasn't completely typical, but the staff was actually bordering on hostile and my pour-over took much, much longer than is typical and the cup I wound up with was actually lukewarm. It tasted surprisingly ok, but lukewarm is... not right for a pour-over. The food looked pretty decent, but the overall experience wasn't pleasant. I don't expect/want a lot of chitchat, but I don't like feeling like I'm intruding. I miss Bluebird, which was in this space a few iterations ago."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-10-29,5,"Wanted a nourishing breakfast without the big wait of a sit-down restaurant.

Got the egg sandwich with bacon and cheese and it was totally divine. Came melted and hot on crusty bread. 

5 stars!!!!"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-10-06,4,"Nice, quiet, small, clean, and elegant. Not much to say but I really enjoyed my time here. The decoration is sort of a robust brick and wood and like I said earlier it's very small."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-09-29,5,"Small cute neighborhood cafe shop . Very friendly staffs, they serve stumptown coffee ,very rich and creamy. They have sandwiches, fresh baked croissants ,mini cookies and gluten free options .my favorite is bagel with cream cheese & tomato and pumpkin cake .I can't stop eating. Thank you guys you all awesome."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-09-23,2,"Small selection, everything slightly overpriced, inattentive staff, and no air conditioning. The food that needs to be refrigerated is all in individual little containers in a refrigerated case, but the baked goods at the counter are gonna be a little soft."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-07-04,5,"Huge fan of the Lazy Llama. 
Staff are accommodating, coffee is good, location is great! 
Word to wise: missing a bathroom. Otherwise atmosphere, views, food, work vibes all spectacular. My go-to joint, great for working and people-watching."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-07-03,4,"The matcha latte was fine though a bit pricey. Still, I needed some wifi for some weekend work (sad!) and this place was a good spot to work for a bit in an area where finding a work space on the weekends can be kinda tough."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-05-30,5,Coffee is great and the owner is the cutest! It's so easy to make good friends here everyday!
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-05-21,5,"Adorable neighborhood coffee shop, great drinks and good espresso. Especially cute during spring and summer, they have added a patch of grass and benches with pillows outside, which are so super cute"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-05-15,5,"Cute, compact coffee house serving Stumptown Coffee.  Limited indoor seating, but really worth a visit. A wonderful respite form the ""Starbucking"" of America."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-05-06,4,"This place is really cute. It's a little coffee shop and has a few tables and bar seats for you to sit at, but is very cozy. They have a good selection of coffees and pastries as well as breakfast items. Would definitely recommend coming here if in the neighborhood and looking for a cute coffee shop."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-05-06,5,"Small neighborhood coffee shop. Great selections of drinks. Mocha was made well! They also have some food/dessert option. 

Sunday hours are wrong - they open at 8am, not 7:30am."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-04-30,5,"Incredible coffee, lovely shop and the sweetest staff! My new go-to post-up place in the East Village."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-04-25,5,"I love this place. Ever since my first visit, I make a point to enjoy my Americano here. Their sandwiches and cakes are very delicious, too. 

They have friendly staff, good music, and very relaxing and cozy environment if you want to read your book or study. What else can you ask for

Besides, there is a playground across a narrow street. I can certainly picture myself sipping my coffee at The Lazy Llama's little patio while watching my daughter playing at the playground. Can't wait for warmer weather."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-03-02,4,"Quaint little coffee spot to sip a cappuccino and get some work done on the laptop. They also seem to serve food, will come back to try their breakfast options."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-03-02,4,"I had a delicious everything bagel with cream cheese - perfectly toasted with a perfect cream cheese to bagel ratio, a bottled fresh juice, and an Americano. The Americano tasted unusual but not bad... it might have been from the spicy juice I just drank though. It's a small place, good vibes and despite being busy they are quick and super friendly. This is the perfect place to pick up something quick and explore the neighbourhood."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-02-03,5,"I adore The Lazy Llama--it's my happy place. Excellent coffee, and the friendliest people you'll ever meet. It's small, but that only means the atmosphere is super cozy and people tend to chat with each other. It's usually quieter in the afternoons. This is hands-down my favorite place to catch up on work on my laptop or read a book. The stools by the windows are perfect for people-watching. Also love the egg bite sandwiches and the blueberry scones."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-01-27,5,"Delicious blueberry scone and stumptown coffee. Small space, but cute & quaint. Will be back!"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-01-21,2,"I went here this morning for a cappuccino and I was not impressed at all. Okay the positive is that they have a nice outside of the building. They have a decent espresso machine, and the service was good. But, I am tired of half way places like this.

It was too small first of all and the fact that there is no bathroom is absurd. Coffee is a laxative. People should know this type of information. Lastly, the cappuccino was not good at all. It was too creamy and not enough coffee taste. Go up the block to 7th ave for better places tbh. You can not have a place with good decor, good name, good concept and the food is crap. And the same goes vice versa, good food with bad service would get the same review as this. This is bs people need to get it together. 

Next time I go to Italian caffe, which is my people and I know I can trust."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-01-15,4,"After reading all the reviews I decided to check this place out! I walked in and there was a wait, this place is tiny so I can see why but this is NY so come on people. If you want a place to lay out go to Starbucks.

Two people work behind the register and they have to make the coffee/food as well. This place is pretty awesome you feel like you are in someone's home. The Staff are very friendly and quick. You can tell they want to make all of their customers happy. 

I ordered a latte with almond milk. From other reviews I saw people raving about the almond milk so I had to try it! My latte was bomb . Com ! Im going back today because I'm now hooked and obsessed with their almond milk lattes  their latte is so creamy and tasty.  I've had my fair share of almond milk lattes and they always seem to be a bit bitter but not at the lazy llama!

The reason I can't give a five star here is because I thought the avocado toast I ordered was just ok. Seemed pretty bland to me. I also would of liked for the avocado to have been freshly made at the time I ordered it. Avocados can be tricky especially if they are not handled fresh. I wouldn't order this again. 

I saw many people ordering the bagel bites, so I'm thinking of trying this next time!

I highly recommend for a true NY coffee experience! Thanks lazy llama"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2017-01-15,3,"This is a cute little cafe that partners with the Cups app! I stopped by here one summer afternoon on my way home from SOHO to get something to quench my thirst and to hide away from the heat and humidity for a short while. I don't know what type of beans they brew, but the iced latte that I ordered was not bad!

The cafe is quite dark and dimly lit, which is made worse by the dark wooden paneling. While it might not be the best cafe to study in, it does make for a cozy environment in which to meet up with friends."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-12-18,5,"Tiny coffee shop serving great coffee (Stumptown).  Even better though are the pastries on offer, especially the little egg bites (focaccia, egg, bacon) and the ham and cheese croissants.  If you just need a little breakfast, not a sit down brunch, this is a great place to pick up something delicious.  There is seating for about 5 people, but you'd get jostled by those in line for coffee."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-12-12,4,"This is a small coffee shop located in the east village. The location is near the F train so it's a good spot to get coffee before your train.

The store only has about 6 - 8 seats so not big at all. The baristas themselves are nice and are helpful. Their skim latte is good and so is their normal iced coffee. 

I would give the place 5 stars but I wish the place was a little bigger."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-12-05,4,"Great espresso drinks using Stumptown beans and the staff are much friendlier than the last espresso bar in this same address. So I hope they stick around! They also serve Ovenly pastries and breakfast sandwiches and ago toast.

They're also on CUPS so use code erx2k and get a $5 credit!"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-11-06,2,"This place is TINY. It's not great for working. They have wifi but no plugs. The seats are *really* close together. Chai was decent and they do have stumptown. This is probably fine as a grab and go place, but honestly nothing really stood out to me here over all the amazing coffee shops in East Village and in Manhattan generally. 

I think it annoys me most because when I see a 4.5 star place on Yelp in NYC, it's supposed to be great -- and not just great in one way -- great in a few ways. I walked 10 mins out of the way for this, as I'm happy to do for true 4.5 star spots, and this just wasn't worth it. 

Bumped down another star because: A little bird flew in and over the fans/lights and scattered dust *everywhere* including in my chai, coat, laptop, etc. It's not their fault a bird flew in, but I don't think they've ever dusted in here before.."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-10-23,5,Excellent coffee and service. Looooooved the yogurt with granola and blueberry compote. A little cramped and crowded but great for to-go orders.
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-10-16,5,"It was kind of a random thing that I have discovered this hole-size coffee bar tucked at the corner of 1st Ave and 1st Street; however the coffee here was deterministically well brewed. They serve stumptown coffee, my all time favorite; while still maintain a low-key ambience. Loved the fact that the coffee was smooth and quite balanced.

By the time I entered the coffee shop, there was already a small line waiting for their daily doses. Don't be scared away, as the barista was super quick and I got my cup within minute. 

It was indeed a lovely place to visit, or to take a short break from the busy life in the city."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-10-11,1,They had next to nothing to offer. I stop in this morning for a breakfast sandwich the guy at counter sand it was a hot breakfast sandwich but it was cold and dry they didn't have mayo or anything to dress it up. I was fully disappointed.
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-09-10,5,"Lovely place, fantastic staff and I adore the interior. I came here once after dropping off my daughter to school. Place is small but you can sit down and enjoy yourself. I had my laptop with me to do my study, there weren't many people at the time I came so I set up my 'working station'. They have free wifi for their customers- that's almost a standard nowadays but it's worth mentioning. 

I think, most people that come here, usually grab things to go. They don't have a public bathroom, which doesn't help when you're drinking caffeinated beverages. 

 I got iced tea and granola. Iced tea was fresh. Next time I'd like to try their coffee. :)"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-08-24,5,"It's a bit out of the way in the morning but I like to come here after tossing out my leftover food at the compost site nearby, (that's right, compost). They serve Stumptown coffee and make a delicious cold brew. There's no fee for choice of almond milk or whatever milk you enjoy. The cafe itself is very cute and a small seating area. There's also a mini outdoor area to sip your coffee. I found this place initially by way of the CUPS app and have continued to visit since."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-08-07,5,"The iced almond milk latte was soooo good and creamy that my buddy and I ended up having two each :) The bf opted for the ginger peach iced tea which was very tasty and refreshing. We also shared a yummy blueberry scone. Loved the cozy decor, their almond milk is the best, they serve Stumptown coffee and cold brew. I can't wait to go back and try their breakfast bites. Shout out to the super talented and friendly barista Avi for making our Sunday afternoon a delight! We are definitely coming back for more :)"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-07-31,4,"Surprisingly visit this place out of blue and I love it!

Location: got very furious for this crazy hot weather and looking for a decent place for a cold brew.
This place is very hard to find but I saw this couple of times and felt like I should pay for a visit to see how the bar looks like, and how they execute their cold brew.

Food: cold brew is surprisingly.

It's strong 
It's balanced
It's cold enough"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-07-29,4,"With time constraints, this tiny coffee shop appeared to have all the legit elements that would pair with very good coffee - a mysteriously small space that still had the charm of a hardwood cottage in Spain, a lingering crowd of locals who seemed to know each other and be regulars, a two seater patio with a smart couple lingering in a slow friendly discussion, a handsome skinny bartender with a little bed head and a simple hip t shirt. 

All this kind of hidden north of Houston behind a playground with large full green leafed trees protecting the door like kind spirits.

The coffee was superb, dark and rich, good beans.

There was a rich looking stack of breakfast sandwiches with bacon and eggs.  But I stuck to coffee.  

The hidden nature of this space makes you feel like you're in a new England town - and you are."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-04-17,5,"Serving awesome, strong stumptown coffee - the baristas are really friendly and accommodating. Never any attitude or judgement especially when it comes to my specific extra almond milk needs hehe. They participate in Cups which makes it super easy and efficient in payment. Also there's never a line! The lazy llama - everyone's must stop for daily dose of caffeine."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-04-10,4,"Came for the cute llama logo, stayed for the coffee! 

Soy and almond milk options. Friendly barista insisted on remaking my cafe au lait when he used the wrong milk the first time. Appreciate the extra effort! Delicious cup to boot"
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-04-02,4,"This is the old bluebird cafe. It looks like they've expanded a bit to include some additional edibles, including some bagel and bakery creations. Coffee was good, barista was friendly, and atmosphere was about the same as before plus some funky tunes. 

If you were a fan of bluebird, then it looks like they kept a good thing good."
7,the-lazy-llama-coffee-bar-new-york-2,2016-03-13,5,"hippie lou loves the lazy llama.

enough said! :) xo"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2020-06-18,5,Great coffee shop with delicious donuts. We got a salted caramel donut that was one of the best donuts I've ever had. I also default to nitro cold brews and their's was very good. I would definitely come back!
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2020-02-25,5,"The Spanish Lattes are fantastic!

I always wondered what made a spanish latte different than a normal latte- and its the condensed milk! (See for example, https://jayarrcoffee.com/blogs/news/what-is-a-spanish-latte)

Gives it a sweeter flavor, very easy to drink"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2020-02-24,2,Has recently been remodeled so tables and chairs are much nicer than before but this is the third time I've been here where the wifi has stopped working halfway through my visit or never worked in the first place. Seems to be not just me because as soon as the wifi stops working the place clears out. The only reason I come here is to because there is ample seating to get work done but since the wifi doesn't even work why bother. Heading to the Bean.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2020-02-10,1,"Came in here to do some work, but didn't find out until after I bought items to justify my use of internet and power that the outlets don't work. Kind of screwed up my workflow."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2020-01-04,4,"This is a great coffee shop right in the heart of the East Village! I came in here today for a grab and go situation. However they had a good amount of tables here. I got a medium iced latte with oat milk. It was a little pricey, but there was an upcharge for having it iced and for the oat milk. 

The person taking orders was not super friendly and even disappeared for a little while right before taking my order. Once I placed my order though, I got it very quickly. It tasted great and I would definitely order it again! This is a good place to grab coffee if your in the east village, especially if you want a cup for the subway ride since it's so close to the 456 and NQRW!"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-12-10,1,"I was the person on the phone in Marissa G.'s review, and I confirm everything that was said. Completely unacceptable. Rude! That barista spoke to me like I was some schoolchild, I am probably at least 10 years his senior. He said ""You should have been ready 20 minutes ago"". And I heard his speech about tips. It was so loud I though there was a drunk and disorderly person in the front room. I literally put my call on hold to go check it out. Closing the store at 6:30 on the minute and being extremely rude about it. Beware! You are not required to tip at the coffee shop no matter how much the employees try to bully the customers. I have a mind to write a letter to the corporate office about this behavior! This all happened 12/9/19"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-12-09,1,"Do not support this business! The two men who work here on weeknights were among the rudest people I have ever encountered in the service industry. 

The following event occurred on 12/9/19

First, the the two ""baristas"" excessively asked for tips. They demanded tips by performing an extravagant monologue. Not only did this distract everyone from their work but also made people feel uncomfortable. 

Next at 6:25 pm, the two men made another announcement. One man screamed (and I mean screamed!) ""we're closing y'all need to get out now"". All of us patrons looked around at each other in shock (not at the restaurant closing 4 hours early but about how this man was speaking to us). The same man then proceeded to hover over people and repeatedly asked them to pack up their stuff. When one man was finishing a phone call, the barista yelled ""hey you you should've been gone 20 mins ago when I asked"" 

Also, mothers, please do not bring children here because the formentoned employees very loudly mentioned  'R' rated topics and used profanity. 

WHO DO THESE MEN THINK THEY ARE?!?

This used to be a go-to for me but looks like I'll have to find a new spot."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-11-17,5,"I enjoy the cold brew at think coffee!

If you go 10 times you get a free medium drink!

However, compared to other Think Coffee locations, this one is always loud and rarely has empty tables. It seems to draw the type that claims and table and uses it as a work station for the day."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-28,2,"So here's the thing- this review isn't about the coffee. I still got a coffee because I was caffeine deprived and it was good, but seeing the state of the bathroom, looking at the floors, and then looking at the garbage areas? Dude. I'm in the union square area all the time. I've never felt the need to write a cleanness based review before because that's not really my jam. But the thing is if I'm going to eat or drink something- I want the place itself to be at least somewhat clean."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-03,1,"One star is too much for this place. I came to work on my laptop - but there is only two outlets in this place and one of them not working at all.  I ordered chai latte with coconut milk and oatmeal. Milk in chai was so burned and bitter that it was impossible to drink it so I asked to make a new one - thankfully they did, but now it tasted like water and was extremely hot that I burned my tongue. Oatmeal is horrible, no sugar no salt nothing, just pieces of oatmeal swimming in the bowl of milk with cinnamon.  I end up throwing everything in a garbage in leaving. Will never come back and would never recommend."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-09-01,3,"I come here so often that I'm surprised to have never reviewed it. It's in such a central location that I always visit. 

This Think Coffee location is like many others in Manhattan: wooden construction everywhere, soft cafe lighting, lots of people working on stuff or studying, ample seating space (though it gets crowded at times). The staff here are friendly and down-to-earth. I also find it cool that Think Coffee uses fair-trade coffee and cares about social impact. The coffee is decent, not phenomenal nor bad.

One caveat about this location in particular, however, is that it can be terribly loud. Straight up CLAMOROUS sometimes. It's not just the sound of espresso drinks being made; you've got people collaborating loudly on a business project, friends gossiping audibly in the corner, buses and dumpster trucks zooming by with a passion, your local crazy person making a scene. Could be very distracting if you've got deadlines, but it's almost endearing when I go back and find myself knowing what to expect."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-07-12,4,Love the free trade coffee Staff friendly and courteous. Pastries were fresh and quite good. For being in NY everyone is friendly
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-06-18,5,"Love the ethics, the coffee is great and atmosphere is really welcoming. Glad they have a few locations."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-04-23,3,The coffee and pastries are excellent but they really need to do something about the lack of seating. When seating runs out and you're stuck with an order and nowhere to sit it can be terribly disappointing. They really should have someone monitoring the situation and letting people know when seats are unavailable.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-03-27,2,"Had a medium coffee $3.25 and buttermilk blueberry scone $3.50. Coffee was winey with some nice fruity notes. Not really worth 3.25. The scone was doughy and sugary with lots of blueberries. As scones go I pay 1.50 off of a coffee stand on 35th that kicks the crap out of a scone twice the price so a little disappointed. The baker over mixed the ingredients. Seems to be indicative of these independent coffee shops, stuff looks good is expensive and is really subpar. Oh well I would go down to all saints coffee on 10th about same price but higher standard."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-03-25,4,"Free WiFi, ample seating, standard coffee options and offers oat milk 

Great place to sit down and work, nothing fancy but does the job!"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-02-09,3,"Coffee is okay, but I'm not expert. 

This place is usually ALWAYS crowded, expect at night. Tables are really small and it's sometimes hard to snag a spot. Outlets are scarce as well. However, I think because it's near NYU, it's popular. WiFi is decent. I think this place is an okay spot to study or get work done, but not the best. They don't play loud music or anything, but it's a pretty casual environment so conversations can get pretty noisy. 

I'm not sure how often tables are cleaned either or if it's self service, but this place generally isn't spotless. 

If you're getting a bagel, they put a LOT of cream cheese on it. I think the lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel is like somewhere around 9 bucks, so this place isn't a BARGAIN. 

Their croissants are really flaky too."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-01-21,2,"Hot take - Think Coffee isn't good coffee. I know! Controversial - but it's just not good coffee. It's basically a step up from diner coffee in flavor. They do have a nice space but when you can't drink the coffee, what's the point? Their fresh squeezed juice is nice. 

Moral of this review - skip it, for this price just get a latte at Starbucks."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-01-20,5,"Having enjoyed Think Coffee for the first time yesterday, I'm now thinking about moving into the Union Square neighborhood so I can enjoy Think Coffee (and Pie By The Pound) every day. Everything about this place represents my idea of the perfect coffee house."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2019-01-20,4,"Close to The Strand and pretty spacious. It was fairly quiet when I was there (Saturday morning). My only complaint was that they did not have hardly any plug ins to charge laptop, phone, etc."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-12-27,1,"The embarrassment of the ""think coffee"" chain. Disgusting service. Not knowing what they are doing when you order something. 
Over crowded because they don't have experienced barista and not enough stuff. 
They don't tell you when your drink is ready, so you better go and find it until it gets cold."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-12-19,2,"This place is noisy AF. In the span of 10 minutes, I heard children screaming, a dog barking, another kid getting disciplined, a dude on a business call, and super loud music on another dude's headphones, on top of the usual milk steamer squealing and the ""should I dump my douchebag boyfriend"" conversation in the corner. (Yes, always yes.) 

It's truly chaos in here. The bathroom is gross. And I don't know why they put ""for here"" orders in paper cups. Ok, so your cups are compostable. But why not keep them out of the waste stream in the first place? Especially when you have an eco-conscious image. I don't think hiring a dishwasher is that expensive, but maybe they have other reasons. 

On the bright side, the Spanish lattes are really good. Also, despite it looking hopelessly packed I was able to get a spot quickly. Aside from that... I don't know.  I didn't get murdered. Always a plus. Might come back but wouldn't study here."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-11-23,4,Coffee was good. A lot of seating pretty busy for Black Friday at around 5 ish. Has a bathroom but it was super dirty . Decent amount of seating. Good customer service.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-11-03,3,"This place makes a great grilled cheese and superb coffee, but there's never anywhere to sit! Every table is taken up by a person on a laptop who plans to buy one coffee and stay for hours. Suggestion to management to reserve a section for people who are just there to eat and socialize with friends. We matter as customers too!"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-10-27,4,"Damned good coffee. Crazy service. Quite busy. Prices are good. Amazing cakes, cookies and sandwiches. Nice atmosphere."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-10-22,2,"My Americano was decent, not the best but good enough. End of compliments, sigh.

Dealbreaker 1: The last 3 times I visited, weekdays around 11am, the rather large seating area was filled and no seats available. NYU kiddies camping out with their laptops. 

Dealbreaker 2: Two tip jars!! One by the cashier and another where the coffee is prepared. They have taken tip jars to a new level. 

Dealbreaker 3: At least give the appearance of being a local and friendly place and say hello or at least smile. Honestly, I don't ever remember a warm greeting at this store.

Dealbreaker 4: Cost for a small Americano and croissant $7.78 with tax."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-10-11,2,"Chai latte and matcha latte is disastrous, I don't know, did they use soy milk in my chai latte? Btw the matcha has no taste,yeah I can't feel any of the bitter salty sweet. That's so sad"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-10-06,4,"I've seen a few of these in the city and finally gave it a try. Ordered our typical favorite Iced Oat Milk Latte. The cup was beautiful and so was the flavor. Pleasantly surprised by how good this coffee was. Tasted like a fine coffee dessert.

This location is huge inside with tons of seating. Such a great place to relax while walking the city. Apparently, they serve breakfast here too."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-09-29,5,"Unreal customer service. Came here at around 11am on a Saturday. My nitro tasted a bit c02 carbonated. I talked to the barista on site and she was EXTREMELY responsive. She went downstairs, adjusted the machine, and got me that sweet sweet nitro with perfect nitrogen carbonation. I hate supporting Starbs but they're the most consistent nitro game in town - though Think almost always has it (the 6th ave location has ran out on me a few times). That said, when Think has their nitro, it's better. Unfortunately, there is no location near my house (UES), but hopefully there will be soon. Bottom line: this is a super nice location (clean) and the staff is legendary."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-08-28,3,"We wanted an afternoon pick me up as we were both feeling rather sleepy after doing some shopping in Union Square, so walked in the closest coffee shop we saw. This Think location was really loud, and had a surprisingly long line - there was a lot of seating that happened to be (or usually is) fully occupied by people catching up and people on laptops/reading. The bathroom was clean, our coffees (my cold brew, his latte) came out quickly,  and we were on our way. Nothing special, but man I would hate to be there trying to focus since it was pretty loud."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-08-22,1,"Very inviting atmosphere brought me in, but don't be fooled, this local coffee chain was extremely disappointing. May have been one of the worst iced coffees I have ever tasted, would not recommend, unless for the free wifi."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-07-24,4,"Great little coffee shop at a convenient location. The front is a bit chattier and noisier, while the back is fairly quiet. Great place to have a conversation/focus on work. 

I was concerned about getting a table so I could do work, but there was a plethora on a Saturday early afternoon. 

I'll definitely return for when I need a change in atmosphere to get work done."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-07-12,1,Rude staff!!! Rude staff!!! Went into this place three times and each and every time the staff behind the counter said something rude! I don't get it??? The coffee is just not good enough to have to endure the rudeness. Customer service is so important!!!! Hello!!!! I will not go there again. Found a better coffee and a friendly staff just a half block away.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-07-09,5,"Love this place. Tried for the first time. Coffee was delicious and flavorful. Service was stellar -- quick but friendly. Also, it was very clean inside, there were plenty of milk options (unlike other big chains that often run out), and the baked goods section looks pretty amaze (I didn't try this though)."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-05-21,4,Coffee is good. Wish they would add lights over the tables.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-04-17,2,"Very friendly staff but disappointing food.  Sandwich and soup came out cold, and were re-done with no hesitation by staff, but still nothing impressive about the food.  Did not try the coffee.  Would have done better at nearby MAOZ or CAVA for food."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-04-13,4,This place is always packed but the service is pretty quick and the coffee is good and the price is fare. Great alternative to the chain coffee shops.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-04-05,4,"Sustainably geared with some fairly quick service (at least for just getting a simple iced coffee). While there are a bunch of seats in the frnt and back, it is pretty packed, and people seem to be about doing their business there rather than just stopping for a quick drink or bite. As I had been walking all day it would have been nice to get a spot inside and rest for a few minutes from walking and the cold. But alas, luck was not on my side. Their menu seemed small but people were ordering things that weren't listed, which confused me and relegated me to keeping my drink order simple. I don't want to take too much time ordering as there was a line, but maybe a bit better signage to help move this along.

I like that they have cups and such with eco-leaning and sustainability in mind. The coffee was good. I had it with almond milk and not gonna lie I keep packets of stevia in my bag, so I added that."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-03-01,1,This place smells amazing from the outside but the coffee is completely water down and nasty. The food is in edible. Not quite sure how it competes in the city. It seems like it's just a location for NYU students to do their homework
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-02-21,5,"I needed a coffee fix so badly that I was pacing outside before they opened.  What I got hit the spot, an iced Americano...smooth with a slight toffee aftertaste.  As I was there, how could I pass up breakfast?  A toasted poppy seed bagel with just the right amount of cream cheese (enough to taste but not the whole tub like some places do) and a lot of smoked salmon.

The perfect way to start the day."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-01-25,1,This place is poorly managed. I had oatmeal and it was the worst oatmeal I've ever had. I believe it was cooked yesterday or few days ago. I had to throw it away before I finish. I had a horrible stomachache after that.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2018-01-17,4,"This cafe has a very warm ambiance and is also open fairly late compared to a lot of other cafes around the area but be warned, for that very reason it's harder to get a seat at night. If you're looking for a place to catch up with a friend, journal, or do work I would recommend coming here. The pricing is average. I ordered the hibiscus iced tea and the basil pesto grilled cheese. You have to add your own sweetener to the iced tea. The grilled cheese was better than I thought it would be! It had a lot of cheese and the bread was nice and crusty :) overall, great experience and I will be coming back here!"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-12-28,5,"Went there on a cold day craving some pastry and good coffee. I will keep my review short and to the point.

Baristas were very welcoming and sweet.

Coffee was nice and strong with high acidity but touch of milk turned it to a great cup of coffee.

My friend's chai latte was good but on a spicier side.

Banana bread and fig bar wash fresh and delicious.

Interior felt like an old cafe with pictures sharing their coffee experience. 

Merci and see you again."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-12-25,1,Terrible service. Long wait times even when there are no customers in line. Needs a new staff. Super slow and take ages to give you basic stuff. Go to another coffee place instead.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-12-02,4,Big fan. Very cool vibes/trendy. Staff is attentive and very quick.  Only pushback is price but paying $3.50 for coffee these days has become pretty standard in NYC
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-11-15,3,"Large coffee shop w/ food options, several types of tables, and internet. Variety of people working on computers or meeting to socialize. Relaxed atmosphere. Shop darker, in terms of light, than I would prefer, making it better for socializing than studying. Enjoyed my drink (chai latte w/ coconut milk) and would be willing to try some of their food."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-11-07,1,Coffee's fine. Says it has free WiFi but doesn't. Which is really cool when you buy your coffee and sit down and get all your crap out to do work and then find that out.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-09-23,3,Good grilled cheese when they want to make it. If you happen to go even 2 hours before closing they will do their best to say the kitchen in closed.  Very bizarre. Good prices and good coffee but the hipster staff needs to lighten up a bit.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-08-31,5,Always a blast to go to. I love seeing the staff and everyone is such a pleasure. The coffee is always top notch. You definitely want to sign up for the stars program as it makes the price worthwhile since you get a free drink after a certain amount of purchases.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-08-27,4,"I got a chance to visit Think Coffee in Union Square on a lazy Sunday in August. The storefront looked warm and inviting, and we saw that it was open until 10PM which is considerably later than most other coffee shops in the vicinity (generally close around 6PM on a Sunday). One thing I really liked about Think Cofee was that I felt comfortable going into the store and setting up shop before going up to order a coffee. Often times at these sorts of places, you are expected to order before finding a seat, but that sometimes leads to purchasing a drink and not having a place to sit. I got a medium chai latte waited a minute or so before I got my drink - it was a lot larger than I expected! I guess I am used to the Starbucks grande size so I was pleasantly surprised to have a good bit of chai to sip on. The drink itself was great - perfect temperature and not too sweet, just how I like it.

As for the space itself, there are really nice and sturdy square desks peppered around the shop and convenient charging spots here and there. I personally felt that the tables were a bit far away from the booth-like seating, so I ended up spending a good bit of time leaning forward when using my computer. But that might just be me - this place seems perfect to catch up with a friend over coffee, or to cozy up with a book. There are front and back areas here, both with ample space. One thing to note is that Think Coffee plays a lot of experimental ambient music - think KAYTRANADA, Mura Masa and the like. That's definitely my vibe, but it may not be for some. Fortunately, the volume isn't too loud so you can easily zone in/out."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-08-25,4,"Good authentic tea flavors
Friendly staff. She even gave me a tip to not leave one of the type of tea in the water too long or it will get too strong. Too bad she didn't know how I like my tea. I just leave it in the bag cuz I like that strong tea flavor. Doesn't get too bitter for me!

Comfortable sitting area when you can do work. 

I dropped by this place after buying a Circle Line sight seeing cruise to kill time. Why? Because there's nothing else to do around the area, and I didn't want to board the boat early. Waste of time"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-08-08,3,"Before I lay out my gripes, let me say that the coffee here is great. The drip coffee is good, the iced coffee is good, cold brew is good, the espresso drinks are good; honestly you can't go wrong. I also give Think props for having soymilk at the dairy station, and not making people request it and/or pay extra. 

That said, drinks are rather expensive ($3.50 for iced coffee) and they're all served in to-go cups. Maybe it's just me, but cold beverages taste better in a glass than in a plastic cup. If I have the time to sit and sip, I like to have a real glass/mug as an option. 

I was surprised by how grimy the restroom is. Overall, Think seemed clean and tidy, but the restrooms felt like it was at a dive bar. It seemed like it gets a lot of use (there's just one toilet, unisex, and this Think location is busy all day!) but isn't cleaned often. In addition to to general grodiness there's also lots of graffiti and stickers. For such a slick coffee shop, I expected a clean and well maintained restroom."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-07-22,4,"Love this place. Great place to get some work done and people-watch in Manhattan. I got the egg & cheese sandwich plus a raspberry muffin and both were quite tasty. The coffee was good, and the staff was super nice. Would definitely recommend if you seek a chill coffee shop, and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-07-14,2,Decent coffee.  Horrible Wifi.  The wifi was very weak and it wouldn't play videos.     I would recommend for them to get the fastest wifi.  Like the one you'd find in any Starbucks in manhattan.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-07-02,2,"I hate to say it, but I was a little disappointed in this Think Coffee location.

It's kind of ""old"" looking, like it needs a remodel.  Or maybe it just needs a good cleaning or something.

The latte I had was pretty weak tasting.  I wish I'd asked for another shot, to put it kindly.

The back of the space is packed with people on their laptops not doing anything but taking up seats.  Just another boorish coffee shop, I'm afraid to say."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-06-27,4,"Laptop reflections glaring along the left wall to the tune of ten, maybe twenty -- whose counting? with a light release of hot beverage steam suggesting I'm amid a brainy, grainy hard working group of grandma & grandpa millenials. A far cry from the surfers that clutter the public library PC's.

Apologetic in his expression and words that there is no dark roast option, unwilling to process this peculiar statement -- its not as if they were fresh out -- it didn't exist, the easy transition was an espresso shot into a medium blend, sold under the name Redeye.
Redeye to me is a shot of espresso, a shot of whiskey and some fat back bacon grease. Rookies.

The interior smacks of the log cabinesque exposed wood I've grown a disdainful opinion of. At the very least, hang a moose head or a old trappers musket, something -- or how about a midsized stuffed fox whose trotting off with yoyr scone and peering over his shoulder. I like the way they sneer at you as if you've just been fleeced - out foxed so too speak.

Great cuppa coffee, served with the lingering apologetic smile. The dollar tip was well spent as the counterman seemed relieved."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-06-25,1,This place looks like it's 100 years old and the food/coffee is over-priced. Service also sucked... never gonna be there again
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-06-06,5,"Honestly, I was only inside this handsome café for a few glorious moments, during which I met one cheerful bartender and one charming barista. Both made me feel like an old friend, and then I sat on their lovely bench outside sipping a very good wine and laughing my head off with an actual old friend. Delightful."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-05-21,3,Cozy enough cafe during the off the hours. Kind of weird that you have to put your own lid for even just a regular cup of coffee. The chocolate chip blondie was kind of dry even though there was some good flavors.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-05-13,4,"Good place to take a sip while waiting for the dim sum place 2 blocks away LOL. Boutique shop with individual tables available deep inside if you want to find a quiet personal place to read or talk. Coffee itself is ok, but the design on the cup is gorgeous."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-04-29,1,"I didn't really like their tea, also the way they presented it was kinda disrespectful. The 2nd time I went there was a new person who was respectful but in a sarcastic way. I've sat in the back and it does get pack with laptop users. Is more of a place to use your laptop than to enjoy a chat with reordering tea. Not my first choice but it's a choice. 

I would say if you need to type a paper up you do have the space and quietness you need."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-04-14,3,"Coffee is pretty good. Open to midnight, always a plus. 
I like the decor - faux marble tables, faux tin ceilings, faux leather seats, faux generosity. Theme of the place is how much activism they do in impoverished countries. What good is generosity unless you can build a business model centered on bragging about it? 
Aside of the pretentiousness, not a bad place. Not too loud, even with a full house. Good for working or sharing coffee with friends. Excellent place to hang with friends  on a Friday nite when you don't want to deal with the bars."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-03-31,3,"This place does things a little different in that they rent out larger spots and provide a nice dimly lit meeting place. I think their light roast coffee is decent but this is an area that is just filled with quality cafes that customer service has to be at the forefront. This place falls short on that end. I've been to this spot several times and each time there was always someone behind the counter that was as informal as you can get. This time it was someone who greeted me with ""yo"" but in a not so inviting way. Something tells me she won't be around for long and this place seems to have a revolving door of employees. Even the person working the floor was antisocial. I'd say come if you have a group with you as other coffee shops can't accommodate large ones. Come if you're one of those types that needs to do work in the middle of busyness. Stay away if staff who look like they're serving a sentence with community work is not your thing."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-03-21,1,This place has gone so far downhill. They had TERRIBLE health department ratings and then managed to get their act together enough to get an A. I just had a coffee and the cream was sour. The place is just gross. Needs better oversight and management.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-02-05,3,"the bathroom was so messy. 
had hot cider and hot chocolate. they were alright. this place opens till midnight so pretty good for late night studying at cafes and caffeine consumption. 
the internet speed is pretty fast and the tables are pretty comfortable. i would say perfect cafe for students. i've been to different think coffee, but i must say here could be better, in terms of the bathroom quality and the service. 
if i have to work late, i might consider going back if I don't really have other options"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-01-30,4,Cool spot for coffee and socializing with friends. I ordered hot cider and it was as expected - good. No disappointments here.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-01-29,5,I come in most evenings after work for a phenomenal chia latte and a quick read. There are normally two girls working the counter. As of late I have not seen either of them in a few weeks; it must be the turnover rate. Without them the service isn't as friendly as it use to be. The chai is still great. The wifi isn't so great; make sure you bring a good book.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2017-01-18,3,"Like so many businesses that I write about I had walked by Think Coffee a bunch of times before I finally got to visit the coffee shop.  Chalk that up to tight schedules and often being in the area to make a movie at the nearby theater.

Think Coffee has an Old Skool feel to it that is like catnip for me.  The big, lit up sign recalls neon signs of old and its wood, beige and silver color combination feels like a set from some movie set in New York City somewhere between the 60's and 80's.  Inside are lots of tables (medium to small) and seating.  The ceiling is still an old style patterned one (painted over of course) and overall the place has a really comfortable feel.

Service was quick, if not a bit loud and perfunctory.  I ordered a Dirty Chai and settled down.  Here's where I will say up front that it is very possible I could bump this review grade up in the future but man...the chai was bad.  There was none of the bright flavor you would expect from a Chai, just a curious sharpness with no depth.  It was, sadly, one of the worst Chais I've ever had.

I get this feeling had I ordered just a plain coffee I would have been happier, so I fully intend to give this place another chance.  Just stay away from the Chai and you should be okay."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-12-29,5,"A nice place to work, study and have conversations where you can find coffee and tasty latte :)"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-12-29,3,"I think the place should be renamed Coffee Perk for it appears to be the reincarnation of the Central Perk from Friends where people come and hang out. The coffee is fine, but don't expect to sit for the tables seem to be occupied by people who are running their business via the Internet, holding meetings over coffee or just hanging out. In a business that lives on turn-over there didn't appear to be much of it."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-12-26,1,"Rude staff! Never going there again! Bought coffee and tea, to sit and talk with a friend. They were blasting music and I asked them to turn it down just a little as we were the only ones in the place. They ignored me and blasted music even louder."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-12-11,3,"I don't drink coffee so don't look for that here in my review. My friends D's wanted to stop by to get some. We sat in the back where a good amount of people were on their laptops using the wifi. It is a cute place with a lot of foot traffic in the front.

I got the hot chocolate and it was actually pretty decent. A good amount of foam on top and the hot chocolate was milky and not too over powering in the chocolate department.

The only complaint I really have about this place is the bathroom. I came on a Wednesday night and the bathroom smelled so bad. Compared the nice interior and how clean everything seems in the rest of the café, the bathroom is disgusting. 

My friend also managed to spill his expresso on himself and no one in the staff really cared to help him."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-11-29,3,"Stopped by here to kill some time on a Monday evening. Will be one of those spots that's better with a pros and cons list:

PROS:
- incredibly spacious, with small tables up front and large booths in the back
- open late compared to other coffee shops
- solid selection of pastries
- eco friendly (though in your face about it)
- offer a variety of drink sizes

CONS:
- iced coffee ($3 for 16oz) was okay, wasn't really strong
- no simple syrup at coffee station (not preferable adding sugar into an iced drink)
- the honey granola bar ($3ish) I got was very sticky and hard to hold, though filling
- bathroom is awful

Considering it was later in the day, there was no line, so got to order quickly and finish my meal in peace. Would come back here if in a jam - as it's still better than Starbucks."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-11-21,1,space Is nice and big. I ordered a Spanish latte like I always do from here but this location made it so wrong. it was all foam. I've never had one this bad before. if I wanted a cappuccino I would have ordered that.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-11-17,3,"Hmm sorry but really a bit mediocre to me. So I had their skinny cappuccino, don't know whether it was because I kicked in too early, or that day they were simply off - I did not quite enjoy my coffee. It was bland, and lack of the regular subtle scent of roasted beans. I did finish my cup, yet probably would not return."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-11-15,5,good iced coffee. great atmosphere. life-changing americanos. not to mention a commitment to fair trade and socio-economic justice that assuages my guilt over spending the majority of my disposable income on espresso.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-11-08,1,"Went here last weekend, I ordered a coffee and my BF ordered an iced americano- both tasted terrible! We had to throw them away, and this is coming from a woman who rarely dislikes coffee. Very strange flavor. Aside from the retched coffee, the atmosphere is simplistic and warm. Wouldn't go back if you paid me, tho."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-11-06,4,"This place is big for a coffee shop in the city and has a nice atmosphere. Relaxing and easy to get work done here. As for the coffee and food, I only ever order Red Eyes and blueberry muffins, but they're always consistently so good. The staff seems friendly enough. I'd recommend it."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-10-28,4,"Day staff is awesome, night staff was a tad 'too cool' for me. Today we went back for the great coffee and also for a dessert. Music was perfect. The bars are just ok, but the banana bread is insanely good. I'd die for that recipe."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-10-21,4,"Love this place. It's my go-to coffee joint for study dates with friends. This is one of the few coffee places in the city that I've been to with actual room. It's large and has tons of seating (although I'm not promising you will find a seat as this place is popular). I've tried several of their items. I usually get the chai. It's not bad but not the best I've ever had. Adding a pump or two of vanilla will sweeten it up and drown out the spice (unless you like the spice). I also got a large glazed donut once to split with a friend. It was fluffy and yummy. No complaints here about the food items I've had so far. I would like to have more welcoming customer service instead of just a pay and go, straight forward, and emotionless/robotic transaction."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-10-13,2,"Sometimes it's a great place to study, but sometimes it's impossible because they blare the *worst* music at full blast."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-09-02,4,"Great, smooth cold brew. Think did cold brew before it became a thing. I remember they had it back in 2008. They also now offer wifi, which used to deter me from going here to study... but they probably were avoiding the laptop loungers. The service is friendly and very chill. More often than not, the new local cafes are staffed with hipsters with handlebar mustaches, suspenders, and fedoras. But the people here are just normal and very relaxed."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-08-25,5,"I occasionally have to work in Union Square and I'm a coffee freak. I rode the subway in with a cup but, once I'm here, I need another fix. Think is my go-to. The coffee's good, the service is good, the place is large enough to grab a seat if I have time for a break. My go-to spot."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-08-24,5,Think is one of the small mom and pop type shops. That being said the coffee was absolutely amazing. Very rich and smooth in taste and texture. I highly recommend you stop by one time
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-07-19,4,"It's a cafe with a bohemian feel and lacking the ultra-hipster attitude of some spots. There's no code required to use the bathroom, which is a plus if you want to gain access easily, but a minus if you mind the massive assortment of graffiti on the wall isn't your style. They fresh-brew coffee if you order decaf -- using a pour over a filter -- so even though the size of a small cup is indeed tiny, it's worth the 2.25. There's a water tap to fill you canteen."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-07-09,1,"OK -Decent coffee. It is expensive - and now they are even more expensive as they have scaled their coffee sizes down!! The small is now extra small, and the medium is the small before. It is just ridiculous! Same expensive price for even much less coffee. I hope they survive in NYC. I am going to avoid this place now."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-07-04,1,"OK folks, be prepared to drink what the cashier charged you for, not what you actually ordered, because apparently that is how it works.  

The coffee is great - I usually used stop in when I am in the area and need a coffee (a dozen times a year, I'd say). But the customer service this week ensured that I would not be back. Came here earlier in the week with a friend.  She placed her order for a drink and a sweet treat.  I asked the cashier if they have almond milk (thought I remembered correctly from previous visits, but it's always good to confirm).  She said yes. I said: ""Great, I'd like an almond milk cappuccino.""  My friend paid for the order on the iPad screen, selecting ""no receipt"" option. When she brought my drink and I took a sip, it was made with regular milk, not almond milk. I walked over to the person who made the drink, and here is the conversation that took place:

""Hi, I ordered an almond milk cappuccino. Was this made with almond milk?""
""No, it is regular milk.""
""OK, well, I asked for almond milk.""
""You weren't charged for it.""
""...OK... but that's what I ordered...""
""If you go pay the difference, I'll make you a new one.  Since you didn't pay for it, this was made with regular milk.""

I went back to the cashier and told her that I placed an order for almond milk coffee, and she said: ""Yes you did, I just didn't charge you for it.""  Wait, what?  I place the order for one thing, get something else, and somehow it's my fault? I didn't mind paying the extra $0.75 (and did when I went back to the cashier), but the barista made it sound like it was my fault for not paying and asking for the almond milk later...  There are a few great coffee spots in the area, so I'll take my business there."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-06-26,2,"From the outside, total five star review - now offering wifi, cool vibe, yummy coffee, etc. However, experience at this shop was completely lacking. The wifi doesn't work (the girl at the table next to us confessed she had to sign into her personal wifi account with Time Warner because theirs doesn't connect) and we were told it doesn't work throughout the entire shop. The bathroom was also a complete disaster and unusable - I expect bathrooms to be gross when I'm out at a bar, but not during a midday study sesh at a coffee shop. Coffee = bomb, and that's great. Atmosphere definitely needs attention."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-06-09,3,"Good place to study, go with your laptop. Coffee is good and the environment is nice. Music sometimes too loud"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-05-15,2,"The fact this coffee shop doesn't have wifi in this day and age is inexcusable. I didn't come here for the coffee, I came here to work. Waste of $5 on a below below average late

Only thing that redeems it from 1 star is lots of space and a good vibe. Would be a good place to have coffee with a friend"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-04-26,5,"I don't know what it is about this place, but their vibe is amazing. It's just the chillest, coolest coffee shop on this side of Manhattan. You can make fantastic coffee and have pretty chairs, but you can't buy a great atmosphere. That's earned.

Having said that, the coffee is pretty great as well. I've had their drip and the latte and both were very good.

So come for the coffee, but stay to just people watch and enjoy the vibe."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-04-10,3,"This is a great place to come to find a motivation to work on something on your laptop as it has electric plugs, a bathroom, free water, and some seats. 

The coffee that they serve are great but a bit expensive and little in quantity. However, it is ok given that this place offers an unique feeling when you are seated inside. The lighting is great, the space is great, and the most important the crowd is also great. Definitely worth coming to this place to get the vibe and energy of the people around you...

The unforgiving thing is that there is no Wi-Fi at this place. It's 2016 and most of the coffee shops offer free Wi-Fi! It is non understandable why this place hasn't offered any Wi-Fi for a very long time... Unforgiving!!!"
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-04-09,4,"I've been to Think Coffee several times and it's always a good / predictable experience - I've only ever had their iced coffee / apple cider and both are good. 

I like this place because it's relatively big compared to most, and even though it's always been crowded every time I've been here (always on the weekends ranging from late morning to late afternoon), the turnover is relatively fast and I feel like I never have to wait long for a seat. 

The place is louder than most coffee shops, so if you're looking for a smaller/quiet place to talk, it's probably not the best. However, there were a lot of different people and groups here - ranging from people studying together in groups, catching up with friends, or alone on laptops.

Main downside is that there is no Wi-Fi, which is my main complaint about Think.

Main upsides are that they have lots of comfortable seating, good coffee/cider, and that they donate part of their profits to a good cause (something I actually didn't know until today)."

I've had better coffee and when I complained about my latte the guy who served me said ""honey this isn't Starbucks you get what you get"". Best part of my experience was when I went to the restroom I found a huge dead roach I went to the counter and complained to the manager who in my 20 min wait did not once go to remove the dead roach or clean the restroom. In a city where coffee houses are on every block bypass this place and find something cleaner with better staff."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-04-01,4,Fast service but I felt very rushed a bit at the register. The barista was sweet very quiet but was in a great spirit. The coffee & pastries are absolutely delicious. Wasn't a fan of the frosting on the carrot cake but the cake itself was yummy and moist. Was very pleased to find non dairy options and vegan snacks. The place is a good size I was able to find seating & an outlet to charge my cellphone. Restroom was small but very clean! Definitely could see myself stopping by again.
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-03-30,3,"Went here for the first time with a friend to catch up and it was a fine spot. Nothing overly tremendous, but definitely nothing bad either.

I bought a medium red eye (coffee with a shot of espresso) and it was pretty good. Good flavor and served up quickly. Not sure what type of bean they use, but I was looking more for convenience than flavor or specialty. 

The drink was good and the price was only like $3.25 which I thought was more than reasonable. The location near Union Square has plenty of seating too so it makes it a great spot to go grab a coffee and hang out."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-03-19,3,"Love Think Coffee in West Village. Union Square Think Village? Not so much.

Ordered a Medium Iced Coffee for $3.25.
Coffee is good, kept me focused a while but I dont understand why there isn't wifi.... It's 2016, help a work-obsessed millennial out and install wifi."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-03-17,4,"Didn't actually get their coffee since it was pretty late at night and I needed to sleep but their hot apple cider was pretty good.

I definitely recommend getting that.

I liked that this place opens pretty late and had lots of room.

Great place to chat with friends.

There are quite a bit of people with their laptops there. Free Wi-Fi."
8,think-coffee-new-york-3,2016-03-17,3,"Came here on a weekday morning (9:30am) to pass some time.  Lots of seating and spacious. People here were just catching up, reading, or working.  Had a spinach and Gruyere croissant that I wasn't impressed with.  Cappuccino was good.  Not sure how loud or crowded it gets on weekends and after work."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2020-03-02,5,Eggs in a cup?  Who thought up eggs in a cup?  I love eggs in a cup!  This hole in the wall spot (and I don't mean that in a bad way) serves up really good food and coffee.
9,summers-soho-new-york,2019-09-15,5,"Super fresh, friendly staff, strong coffee, great little outdoor space just outside the front. The veggie sandwich and eggs in a cup were just what we were hoping for. They use bamboo straws, to boot! Definitely coming back here."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2019-08-28,3,"This review is just for the watermelon smoothie. It was a hot day and we really needed something refreshing to drink. The smoothie was excellent and refreshing, but it was mostly just watermelon so nothing particularly noteworthy beyond that."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2019-07-29,5,"Neighbourhood gem! Summers was my go-to weekend morning digs for a quick bite when I lived in the area. Can't go wrong with a smoothie and egg sammy +bacon. They're also open ALL the time (and early, unlike other places in that vicinity) so you can def rely on them, even through the snow storms.

Shout out to everyone who works there - all super friendly and down to earth."

9,summers-soho-new-york,2019-07-26,5,"I love this little bit of west coast in the East Village! Went there daily when staying at an air bnb across the street and pop in when in the area in NYC, often. Great coffee, people, food, and vibe!"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2019-07-17,5,My new favorite local breakfast/lunch place to go to! Love their signature breakfast burrito and egg sandwich!
9,summers-soho-new-york,2019-07-09,3,"TL;DR: a slice of Cali in the heart of SoHo with great service and nice outdoor seating.

On a sunshiny day in the middle of June, we stopped by for breakfast though it was nearly noon. 
With outside seating on the New York street, SoHo was transformed to channel the California beat. 
Inside we were greeted by a kind soul with a smile, and we ordered the acai bowls to stay for a while. 

The acai was nutritious and basic, but nothing to cheer - the real magic lay in the ambiance here. I'd revisit to try the coffee and other snacks if only to feel like I'd been to Cali and back."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2019-07-06,1,The woman who I think is the owner is extremely rude. We were trying to get two bottled drinks and waited at the cashier counter for minutes and no one ever tried to greet us. Finally she looked at us and I said I just want these two and she stared at me very unfriendly and said okay I'm busy and went back to her smoothie making. I understand you are busy making smoothies and I was just trying to let you know we are ready to pay. That's it. Does it really have to be this mean!?!? Geez.
9,summers-soho-new-york,2019-03-09,5,My Go-to Breakfast spot in Manhattan with really awesome west coast vibes.   Fresh & delicious.  The Breakfast Burrito and the AÇAÍ bowl are both the bomb.  Staff here are very friendly and it's always a pleasure to drop by.
9,summers-soho-new-york,2019-03-01,4,"Tiny, cute SoHo spot with SoCal vibes. A bench, a few stools for seating and a wall displaying projector videos. 

There's quite a range of smoothies and your standard espresso based drinks (they use Devocion drinks). You can add CBD oil to any of them haha. We tried the Purp (acai, banana, almond milk) smoothie with CBD and an espresso. Given that this is SoHo, that cost just under $20. 

Service is friendly, smoothie tasty, just a bit pricier than my usual spots."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2019-03-01,3,"I came here looking for a new coffee place to try. I got an iced americano, it was just ok. They didn't have skim milk, just oat and whole milk, which was weird. I probably wouldn't come back for the coffee, but I'd try the food. There isn't really much of a seating area, but the inside is cute. Apparently the açaí bowl is a pre-made frozen one so beware."

9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-11-25,5,Love this place ! Try the green smoothie and vegetable sandwich!  Small and they are quick and perfect every time .
9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-09-25,5,"I have been coming here for months now and I feel inclined to write a review because of how great this place is. It's a SoHo gem for the neighborhood and for health freaks like myself 

My favorite is the AÇAÍ bowl (favorite  go-to-place for an Açaí bowl in the city)! 

The fish tacos are perfect for any type of weather, and only $4! 

And for a mad hangover, the eggs in a cup and the so-cal sandwich are great go-to  

Not only is the food menu splendid, but so are the people that work there. They have created a really nice environment. Good food, good vibes, and good people.  

They also sell CBD infused coffee and more.

  ‍"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-09-17,1,"Excruciatingly rude service, overpriced, and not even good. The girl at the counter literally made me cry... I was just ordering a coffee. I live two doors down and would walk ten miles for anything rather than go back to Summers. Try it if you like matcha that tastes like sand."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-09-10,2,I ordered this through Mealpal and it was a mistake to travel all the way to pick up such dry tasteless sandwich. What was the point of excluding egg and make this such a terrible sandwich and make the customer never want to go back? Lots of bean sprouts. That is the only thing I liked about it.
9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-08-19,4,"A small but festive little joint on the corner of Thompson and Houston. I've passed it many times, but finally ate a quick bite when I realized I was out of eggs after a short vacation. The breakfast burrito for $11 dollars was stuffed with 3 eggs, peppers, spinach, and just enough of the right hot spices to make it savory. The Coffee was fresh and despite having only 3 seats me and my brother squeezed in A-OK. I'll come back to try the acai bowl at some point. Props to the servers for being cool and chill."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-08-10,4,One of the top breakfast sandwiches in NYC. Great food and vibe. Pricy. Painful wait times leave you scratching your head. Def 5 stars if they that figure
9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-07-29,5,"So delicious. Light, healthy and fun. Such a fun place to stop for breakfast or a fun smoothie treat. Definitely recommend"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-06-20,4,Great breakfast sandwich. Amazing smoothies. Very quick. Would be 5 stars but the breakfast burrito isn't great. Mostly egg and they were over cooked. But still love this spot!
9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-04-28,4,"Stopped in here to get so quick breakfast. The burrito was amazing, can't wait to try the other things on the menu."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-03-06,4,"Super cute interior made me feel like I stepped out of the NYC cold into a little tiki hut. They make a pretty solid egg sandwich! Almost dangerous to now know this deliciousness is so close. I was a little put off by the customer who insisted on hanging out with their dog inside, but thankfully it doesn't seem like it affected the outcome of the sandwich :) Would definitely go back."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-02-24,5,"Tastes like California. So yummy, great for a cheer up in a gloomy day. Coolest little place in the neighborhood, I'd keep coming back here for tasty treats and breakfast. Had the red smoothie, I think it's nice that the menu is simple, especially for me who has problems with choosing!"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2018-01-30,5,"Pricey, but it might be the very best breakfast sandwich I've ever had."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-11-26,5,"One of The coolest things about New York is the unlimited choices of restaurants and cafes. You can't walk 5 blocks without passing by something to eat! And in that case, if you're willing, you may discover hole in the walls or small places you never thought you'd walk into. 

Summer was one of these spots. We were looking for a brunch spot but saw summer's menu and loved all the options.  My husband decided on getting the So Cal sandwich, which he said was delicious but quite spicy. It has chorizo AND spicy sauce, so if you're not into spicy stuff, opt for the other choices.  I decided to get the veggie sandwich for $10, which was the BEST. DECISION. EVER.  Holy moly, for a simple brunch meal like that, I was so satisfied.  The veggie sandwich included pickled red onions, avocado, cage-free eggs, tomato, spicy mayo (I opted for regular mayo), all between 2 pieces of 7 grain bread.  It may have been the pickled red onions that added the flavor, but each bite was exploding with flavor.  It was so good I swear I licked the plate!  I would honestly come back here just for that sandwich again. The bread was soft, which grain breads usually are not.  

I loved the service.  There's only 2 people working behind the counter but they were very nice and will accommodate to your requests.  Next time I could, I will try out their coffee, which is blended from Devocion beans.  I'll be back!"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-10-27,4,"They stopped selling fresh juices since they sold the other location which sucks, and the last 5 times I went in there it took over 15 minutes for my order and there were like a million flys all over the food. Also seems like the prices of food keep going up. I get that it's a small place with fresh fruit so the flys and the wait are unavoidable, but I hope that as they get more and more popular (and expensive) they still value quality and customer service! Smoothies are still the bomb."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-09-10,1,"If you're looking for an $11 freezer burned Acai Bowl, look no further!

I can list 100 better places to get your money's worth but I'll spare your eyes and only list 3:

1. The trash

2. AAA Baseball tailgate 

3. New Jersey"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-09-02,5,"One of my Soho spots when I need to refuel. The banana bread is one of the best in the city. Service is fast, staff is nice and overall a pleasant experience every time I go!"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-09-01,1,"I've come here in the past and found it very expensive for fine but somewhat flavorless food. 

Walked by today and there was a sign out front that said ""Locals Only--No Kooks.""  Seems pretty distasteful in this political climate. And since I'm not a local, so I guess they don't want my business."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-08-27,4,"Had a delicious egg sandwich (although I skipped the Sriracha [sue me] and added bacon) and a cup of coffee. Staff was friendly and lively, and there are some cute gifts along the wall for all your impulse buy needs. I didn't like the fluorescent lighting too much -- it takes away from the surfin'/skatin' California vibe they seem to be going for. Seating is small but comfortable, although I suggest to get your food to go and take it to Washington Square Park."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-07-17,2,"This place has gotten great reviews. And I thought the breakfast sandwich was very good (although pricey). However I knock off stars for being a breakfast place serving coffee that doesn't stock a range of milk additions. You'd better want almond or whole milk, since that's all they have. No skim. No half and half. I discovered this after already ordering coffee. They saw I was unhappy -- it ruins my breakfast. Did they offer a refund? Alas, no. So more stars off for not respecting their customers. Shame -- I wanted to like this place."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-04-12,2,I was looking for a good place to grab a healthy lunch and work for a couple hours - and this seemed to fit the bill. Bad choice! The barista was so distracted talking to her friends that she completely forgot to make my acai bowl (the ONLY thing I ordered!!) and instead made smoothies for her friends first. She didn't remember I had ordered anything until I interrupted her gossiping with her friends 10-15 mins later... and wasn't at all apologetic about it. The acai bowl was nothing but granola - nowhere near worth $11. Won't be going back!
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-04-08,5,Amazing place very small and limited seating but the food was phenomenal creative and I'm still craving the veggie egg sandwich like 3 weeks later.
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-03-14,4,"Amazing, cute little hole in the wall where you would least expect it. 

First off - Whoa, great coffee. Apparently they use Devocion from Brooklyn (need to check it out).

Then to the food, it was a bit over priced for an egg sandwich for brunch and a veggie sandwich for the gf, but really it was scrumptious.

Healthy, yummy and not overpacked like other locations in the area, I'll definitely swing by again when looking for a healthy bite on the go."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-02-18,5,"The guys are are kind, detail oriented, and genuinely doing a great job of serving quality. Excellent prices to boot."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-01-31,5,"This is a small and extremely well decorated restaurant with all kinds of cool artsy stuff that truly express the real summer, and the counter guy on Tuesday around 5pm was super friendly and nice. Overall, a great place to eat in a great atmosphere."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-01-28,5,"Very good coffee. 
Not a lot of room to sit around, but they have lots of food choices and it really smells great in there....that is if you love the smell of bacon."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-01-28,5,They serve Devocion coffee and I start with the  runny egg sandwich. Solid spot for starting the day or for a recharge when stomping around SoHo!
9,summers-soho-new-york,2017-01-28,5,"Summers has become my favorite morning spot- they have amazing smoothies and cold presses juices. Their coffee is great, and I love their egg sandwich (add bacon!) the staff is super friendly, and the vibe is chill."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-11-16,3,"Sitting here in my office, with a half-full stomach and I'm still trying to justify that my $9.52 avocado toast was worth it. (Ordered it off of Uber Eats) 

Thought I'd be fancy shamncy today and order breakfast from Uber Eats because it's hump day and I'm hungry.  (Still hungry.)

The toast itself was $6 but with the charge from Uber Eats, my breakfast soon became a whopping $9.52. (I'm a poor college student, that likes to splurge on food once in a while. )

The image on Uber Eats portrayed a sandwich like figure with two pieces of bread and avocado in the center. So obviously, I anticipated two slices of bread but what I received was a slice of toast with some avocado and a lot of hot pepper flakes. It also came with a side of tomato salsa.  (Meh.)

Did I gobble the whole thing? YOU BET I DID. Was it absolutely delicious? No. 

I was disappointed. I think they left out some salt and pepper on the avocado. Instead, they put a whole bunch of hot pepper flakes. My lips are still feeling that sensation, y'know when you  eat something spicy and you're not expecting it and it leaves your lips feeling a;laksdjf. MMMMMHM. 

The 7-Grain bread was the only highlight of this breakfast treat.

Also, I'm still hungry....

Maybe next time I'll try their organic juices but until then..."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-11-12,4,"Probably I made a wrong choice here, by ordering cappuccino instead of their renown organic juices - green, yellow, orange or red. Very similar to what you would get at Butcher's daughter. Aside from coffee and juice, they also serve freshly made fruit smoothies (including my favorite Acai bowl) and breakfast items. Hmm I love my almond cappuccino!

Unfortunately, they do not carry skim milk...and the store is really tiny, that you probably would have to squeeze among people. Would like to give a try on their juices next time stopping by."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-10-16,3,"This place is hit or miss -- when you get someone who knows what they're doing, the coffee is great...but even then the wait can be pretty bad. The shop is tiny (but cute) and there are usually four people crammed behind the counter, usually looking really flustered, trying to make coffee, juices and food -- definitely ambitious for the size of the place and the motivation levels of most employees. All that being said, I live next door and like to support the smaller/local spots instead of Starbucks so I'll keep giving them a chance now and then, although I never bother with the food."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-10-02,5,Just walked past here today with my friend and got drawn in. So happy we stopped by. Got an orange/carrot juice - super delicious! My friend tried the avocado toast - generous amount of avocado and tomatoes on top. Perfect if you need something small to eat ($5). Would definitely come back here.
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-08-28,4,"Came in early on a Saturday morning and got the Acai bowl ($11). It was super refreshing and had great texture/flavor. Perfect if you're looking for a light refreshing breakfast!

The place itself has really cute decor - succulents, a bike, etc. There's not too much seating - just one bar area and a bench outside.

4 stars for the good food and setting, -1 star because it is slightly pricey for a bowl."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-08-13,1,"Meh, definitely false advertisement. NOT the best egg sandwich in the city. Not even remotely close. They didn't even make the egg the star of the sandwich! What a joke. Waste stomach space eating here. 

I wouldn't be so upset if not for the fact that they claim to be the best. Oh, and they sell watermelon juice for $10. Ridiculous. 

Bonus: they took a long time making the egg sandwich. Be prepared to wait and wait and wait for an average sandwich."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-08-07,5,"Delicious coffee, GF breads. I love the eggs in a cup. The almond latte is creamy & delicious. The date smoothie is a tasty pick me up. Love the California vibe. Great little shop."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-07-14,5,Their spicy avocado toast was amazing. The barista was super friendly and had a beautiful smile to go with the coffee  . There was no long lines like in Starbucks and everything tasted fresh. Zero complaints
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-07-07,4,Always has great coffee. The egg sandwich might be one the best I ever had bacon added on is a must. Price a little steep but not unusual considering the location.
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-07-06,5,"Delicious!!! Fresh, healthy food done right! The coffee here is also great; I've had the cold brew and the lattes. Breakfast sandwich is great, egg avo, cheese, siracha on a fluffy toasted roll. I'm definitely coming back! (Not too much seating room but easy to grab and go)"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-07-04,5,"The ""green"" smoothie is simple and tasty.  What I like is how simple it was, no ice cream or sorbet.  Also they know what they are doing and don't have to lookup the receipts.  Hemp seeks on top were great, I will do the same for now on.  $9 for a smoothie is inline for NYC pricing and excellent for Soho."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-07-04,5,"Being 4th of July today many places were closed and we saw the reviews on Yelp and had to go. Being from Australia we were unable to call to see if they were open. So we took the chance that they would and we were in luck, although they were a man down today and inundated with orders, the front man stepped up and ran the show and handled it with true professionalism. Making sure all his customers were looked after and thanking us for our patience. This place is awesome.. The perfect way to start the day. Coffee, Healthy Brekky and a green juice to go. We will be coming back every morning untill we leave. May the fourth be with you !!"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-06-22,5,"Came here today after rediscovering it while looking through my Yelp bookmarks. I got their green smoothie and their egg sandwich. While the green smoothie was a bit pricy ($9), it was one of the best ones I have had. It was the perfect amount of healthy and sweet and I loved how they topped it with seeds. The egg sandwich ($6.5) was so yummy too! The Sriracha sauce was a perfect addition to the overall sandwich. 

It's a super small location but there are still a couple of seats usually available since many people take their items to go. Also the guy working was really nice and personable. I would definitely return."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-06-03,4,Chill surfer coffee and juice. It's new but feels like it has been here forever. Nice staff and quick service. Everything I've had so far is very good. The drip coffee has a wonderful nutty/rich flavor and their Siracha egg sandwich is amazing.
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-05-18,5,"Love this place! My walk to work has improved significantly since they opened - their egg sandwich with sriracha sauce is awesome, so are eggs in a cup (for no-carb kind of days), and my favorite is the filling and refreshing green smoothie. Also, having nice people greet you in the morning with a smile on their faces is such a rarity in this city, and that alone makes it a worthwhile stop!"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-05-06,5,"Love love love this place. Adorable, tasty, and everyone is super friendly. 
Espresso to die for, my latte was straight up delicious"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-04-06,4,"Came here because I was in denial of the sudden cold weather!  It was my first time here, and I'd say I'd come back again if I wanted to grab a cheap healthy bite!  Originally planned to get the fresh coconut, but they hadn't restocked yet, so went for the Green smoothie instead.  Good combo, none of that grassy veggie taste even though they had kale in it I think, but a tad too sweet for me.  Avocado toast was pretty good - generous amount of avocado.  Size is smaller than what you'd typically get when you order avotoast, but it was only $5 so no complaints there!"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-03-08,4,this is what i treat myself to whenever the weather is nice and i want to feel healthy about my life choices. I've been here on multiple occasions and unfortunately always forget what fruits and veggies go well together so every juice i get tastes a little different. i would say though that my last juice was a little spicy... and i didn't ask for anything spicy in it. so just be cautious since you might get some flavors you wouldn't expect. the juicer has probably processed other fruits and veggies.
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-02-16,4,"I was in a hurry and looking for a bite to eat on the go- I live in the neighborhood and saw that Summers popped up and thought I'd give it a try. Their staff is very friendly, coffee is good, and the egg breakfast sandwich I had was great! Definitely stop in if you're looking for an easy morning stop."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-02-13,5,"I've lived in the village for three years and hadn't come across the perfect breakfast sandwich for my taste until I came across this place. Summers has a great combination of a friendly ambiance, flavorful and freshly prepared food and a great variety of drinks (delicious juices and good coffee). I got a breakfast sandwich from there this morning, as I usually do, and it was delicious, as always."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-02-03,4,"Their $6.50 egg sandwich was very slow to prepare, and tasty but definitely mostly bread and not filling for an egg sandwich of that price from a spot that doesn't specialize in eggs like Egg Shop or BEC. WiFi was on the fritz during my visit, a troubleshooting conversation underway as I perused the Ovenly pastries.

Their Square receipt and gMaps have this location as ""Summers SoHo"", which is odd because they're clearly (albeit barely) north of Houston."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2016-01-06,4,"Are you a green juice & eggs in a cup person, or a cold brew & muffin person?  Either way, they have you covered- with a soundtrack to keep you moving.

Tucked into a street where most places open much later in the day, this 7:30am opening time provides a quick morning or mid-afternoon stop with a chill vibe, surf theme, and a choice set of healthy and indulgent eats.  They've even managed to make seating for 6-8 people inside their limited storefront, and a bench outdoors for few more.   For the coffee lover, roasting date is posted for the coffee made available for sale."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2015-11-21,1,"Ordered two breakfast sandwiches with bacon (paid extra)- left, and there was no bacon. Called back immediately to get another two made. When I got there, they had the nerve to ask if we wanted to just put a couple slices of bacon onto the cold, mis-made sandwiches. 16 minutes later after I called they were ready. Maybe getting two breakfast sandwiches to go wouldn't had taken 30 whole minutes if one of the guys would have been making food instead of stamping their logo onto coffee cups. Just saying."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2015-11-14,5,"So glad to see a new Summers location in Manhattan. The store is smaller than the one in Williamsburg but quality of food and drinks is on par. There are a couple bar seats, a bench inside and a bench outside.

Aside from the fresh juice and smoothies, they have a range of Ovenly baked goods, 16oz packaged bottles of juices, chickpea salads on the side, Devocion coffee, and an amazing Egg sandwich (probably because of the sriracha!) That spiciness took this sandwich up a notch.

Friendly baristas and owner (Chris). Really love the positive vibes at Summers. Overall, great addition to the area!"
9,summers-soho-new-york,2015-11-02,5,"The breakfast sandwiches are amazing and so well priced (!) -- I highly recommend the avocado toast. The smoothies, juices, and coffee are also ridiculously good. 

This place is the new ""it"". It has an amazing ambiance to bring the locals living in soho and in the heart of the village.

California love."
9,summers-soho-new-york,2015-10-28,5,"THAT is an egg freakin' sandwich!!!! The roll, the perfectly cooked egg, the creamy avocado, the bacon-just awesome."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2020-03-17,4,"ALL locations of Pret A Manger in NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, D.C. and Chicago (except at the University of Chicago) are closed until further notice, due to the coronavirus situation.  The company will be donating all of their unsold food & ingredients to food rescues, local hospitals, police stations and schools."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2019-11-15,1,"Stank-Stank-Stankalicious...is what I'd describe the staff.  Reeks of teenage angst with a dash of ageism curled up in a ball of poo-poo. Consequently, this poo is flung at tired, unsuspecting masses willing to pay for overpriced sammiches in trade for brief refuge and rest. The checkout counter gives major stink-eye and tude that's completely unwarranted.  Like just breathe or ask for a receipt and boom, stink-eye.  

I only come here now if I am absolutely desperate bc despite the staff, their wraps are a healthier alternative to many things around Union Sq and there's seating on the 2nd fl (although every time I've gone trash is left all over the tables and floors so bring some spare gloves).  However, if you need to use the restroom, head over to Barnes and Nobles or to Union Sq park bc this place requires code."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2019-04-17,3,"The food is mostly cold and the bread is of worst kind the white flower mostly. Will stick to your intestines for a very long time.

Ha vest cookies and in season lobster bisque is the only good things happening there."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2019-04-03,4,"Just had a book club meeting here, and the service was ok. My biggest pet peeve is when someone is taking your order (or should be taking your order) and is chatting with another working or otherwise ignoring me. The woman who took my order was loudly conversing with a friend across the counter, so I had to wait to order and was interrupted while asking questions. My espresso came out with no cream (I mean, it's hard to take orders and chat at the same time so I get it but also just do your job), which is obviously not a big deal but it made me feel justified in my annoyance. 

Right around closing time a drunk and disorderly patron was generally causing problems and ended up throwing a stool. The staff was very professional with him, even after he began slinging racial epithets. He eventually left, pausing to heckle a few other customers on the way out, but the behaviour of the staff was really admirable. 

TLDR: disengaged counter worker, okay espresso, fun possibility of witnessing drunken stool slinging"
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2019-03-06,1,"The staff is horrible.  I have been there five times or so.  They are incredibly grumpy.  Does it hurt to smile and say hello.   Actually, you are being paid to do so, just FYI.  They stare everyone down as if to say ""Why are you here, we don't want you in this store.""  With another Pret nearby, I am going there instead from now on."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2019-02-22,3,"The food is a bit pricey for being premade, an avocado cheese salad is $10, probably average in NYC. All the sandwiches are about $8 and up. Tried the turmeric tea which was very weak. Tea is $2.67, not bad for a medium size. There is plenty of seating upstairs, an employee gave one of the customers a time limit since they were parked with a laptop, probably for awhile."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2019-02-20,1,"Been a long-time customer, esp. the one at Union Square, but aside from raising their prices annually, what they just did was the WORST.

There are many students that go there, esp from NYU that use the cafe as a place to study, meet, etc... so there are plenty of outlets for people to charge their laptops and phone while they work or eat lunch or hang out.  One day, last week, they unplugged them all.  But they claimed it was ""broken.""  BS.

Really?  No wonder the place is empty now.  I've been to other Prets which are wonderful (esp. the one on 45th and 6th Ave), but the one in Union Square is now WORSE THAN STARBUCKS (which I refuse to go to anymore).  Cross this out your list of places to go."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2019-02-18,3,"This is a two-floor Pret, so there is plenty of space to sit. However, actual tables are upstairs and window seats are downstairs. I mainly wanted to write this review to mention David, because he was so friendly and funny, and he particularly made my day! Thank you, David, you charming man, you. 

However, the disappointing thing was that all their outlets downstairs are fully dead, and there are none available upstairs! Bring back the outlets! It was so inconvenient to sit down and start working, but see that I couldn't stay due to lack of power! So keep that in mind if you're planning to come here to do work."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2019-01-17,2,"Food looks good and tastes good too! East place to stop in for a quick bite or coffee. The people situation? Loud and unprofessional, carrying personal conversations in length and in volume as if they were in the club. Please, have fun and enjoy your job, but don't have a conversation with your coworker across the room about something inappropriate that's so loud it's hurting my ears. The cashiers are obviously not trained as real baristas because they had no clue what I was asking for. I don't expect everyone to know all things coffee, and as someone who was a barista for years, i always remember that it takes time to learn. But when I realized the girl had no real knowledge, I politely apologized and listed the three ingredients in my order...three times. It was still wrong. I'll be back in a pinch, but don't plan on it being a favorite return. Oh well."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2019-01-12,2,"I used to go there on a daily basis but have had to stop because I've had too many quality issues with their food and it seems like the management doesn't actually care.  I emailed the customer service contact the first time I bought something that ended up being bad.  They asked for my address to send me a gift card or voucher or something.  I don't remember what they offered, all I know is nothing ever came.

Any subsequent emails to them have been completely ignored.  Is it because they think I like to whine?  Maybe. Maybe they have a one-strike rule with customers.  But if I'm spending $20 a day there and I occasionally throw out items for being bad, once I dig in a little, then I deserve to give some feedback and have the issue resolved.

The worst items I've ever purchased were a salad that had all brown leaves, rotten tomatoes, and brown avocado, once I dug deeper, and a falafel that ended up being cold in the middle (despite them being heated up, supposedly).  I bought a banana for a dollar there the last day I went, and it was completely black on the inside. If it was an isolate event, I could forgive it, but I've had to throw out parts of salads, wraps, and whole $4 coffee drinks before because they were bad or horrible.

They're obsessed with cilantro, which not only adds nothing to a sandwich, but actually tastes bad. I ended up throwing out most of some Asian chicken thing because it was just a bunch of nasty over-powering cilantro.

They need to come to terms with the fact that their clientele is health conscious and may have food allergies.  I HATE to be one of those people because I am anti-hipster and anti-SJW and all of that, but my digestive system nevertheless likes to eat like one.  Certain grains and dairy just hurt my stomach.  But they put dairy in EVERYTHING.  It's lazy cooking.  Obviously cheese is going to taste good, but a sizeable portion of the population is lactose intolerant.  Also, why do you need to have 100 grain bread but no white bread?  It increases the likelihood that someone with allergy or intolerance won't be able to buy something.

I also will echo what others have said about the lines.  Granted, it's usually other customers that annoy me.  Every time I'm there they yell about separate lines, and the people in front don't move.  I'm always in the back wondering if I should cut the line just to shut the cashiers up.  I think one of the issues is that alot of the customers seem to be foreigners and maybe they don't understand English or they're afraid to line-jump.  Either way, Pret's yelling at customers apparently isn't working so they need to do something else.

Further, they need a barista!  They can't make cappuccinos for crap.  Milk in coffee is not a cappuccino.  That's not why you were playing with the fancy coffee machine.  The few cappuccinos I've gotten there ended up in the garbage, unfortunately.   Starbucks makes a soy cappucino with the correct proportion of ingredients and it takes almost chocolatey.  Pret's just tastes like a heavy cup of soy milk. (And don't make fun of me for drinking soy occasionally, my stomach doesn't like real milk).

I will give them kudos though for cracking down on the bathroom use by walk-in non-customers.  As is typical of NY, the less a person buys, the longer they will hog the bathroom.  One of the things I hate about living here.  Why on Earth people will hog a public restroom for 15 minutes is beyond me but I see it all the time.  Maybe it means you didn't have to go?  There is a Barnes and Noble AND one of NY's few public bathrooms a few hundred feet away.  No need to harrass actual customers for the restroom code.  Last time I sat there, 5 people came up to me and asked for the bathroom.  It was ANNOYING.  However, if they're going to be checking if people have receipts, then PRINT FREAKING RECEIPTS!  They actually don't give them out unless you ask.

I also need to call out there use of plastic.  Stop pretending to be good when you still use a bunch of bulky plastics to house small portions of food when we know you don't recycle.  Use paper with a plastic window like Panera and others do.

Long story short, they've peaked and they were great for a while, but now they're average quality with the occasional rotten product, and don't listen to people who actually spent money there.

My break up with Pret is sad because I work right next to them and did like some of their salads.  I also had enjoyed their egg sandwiches until they doubled the size for no reason, except maybe to cater to the guys splitting rail or doing back breaking work who don't eat there.  They need to face the truth that their clientele is thin, health conscious office workers who actually like the option to buy food in regular or small quantities.  Other places serve food in such large quantities you're going to be falling asleep or having acid reflux at your desk.  Why they needed to supersize the breakfast food was beyond me."

Wifi is separated by floors too so not everyone is slowing down the same connection.  Good place to hold a quick meeting!"

10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2018-12-12,4,"Their food is good. Some of it CAN be better. The prices are a bit steep, not gonna lie. I love their almond milk lattes, they're delicious and adore their almond croissants. The staff is pretty efficient and work fast, which is a good thing."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2018-11-24,4,The Quick: Love their vegan cauliflower fallafel hummus salad! Great spot for a quick grab and go healthy lunch or snack.
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2018-10-19,1,"Have to give 1 star.
Not all staffs here are bad, but there are definitely some very rude ones.
I ordered a latte and the barista forgot the order, while I was waiting on the side, I got yelled at from behind because he forgot what I ordered.
Like really? You have to yell at customer because you forgot the order? Not one, but the cashier also yelled ""heyyyyy""..
So rude."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2018-10-05,3,"Pret is probably my favorite fast place to grab something on the go or have a working lunch, and the union square location is always efficient and friendly.  Honestly though I'm consistently disappointed that they don't have newer vegetarian options. When seasonal items come out it would be nice to have at least one new thing to try.  But at least they have some veggie options and they're unusually nice and fresh!"
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2018-09-18,5,Best pret was n the city! They didn't have tomato feta soup out yet and the manager ran to grab one for me wow amazing service! And I LOVE the team spirit! Everyone looks soo happy to be working here and it shows thank you guys soo much
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2018-09-10,5,"Friendly staff, great variety of delicious sandwich. Pesto Chicken Baguette is my all time favorite! I wish they have a large sign with the sandwiches available to prevent crowds of people hogging the stand just to read each description of the sandwich. Craving that Baguette while I am typing this review! Will be stopping by this location more often!"
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2018-08-29,2,"I have been coming here for a while at least once a week, and literally every single time they forget my coffee order. This morning they both forgot my order and made it incorrectly so it was basically water. It is always a very disappointing experience, and I won't be coming back to this location in the future."
10,pret-a-manger-new-york-52,2018-08-06,1,"so we have the employees walking around being lous and obnoxious while eating. then we have my cashier that didnt even greet or tell me to step down, waiting for me to walk to her. she then talks to another employee for another 30 seconds while i wait there waiting to know the price total for my drink. I will never come back here, thanks"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2020-02-27,4,"I've been to Grand Central a couple of times, and it's a great option. On my last visit, I got a plain iced latte. It was good, but nothing spectacular. But this place shines in their special offerings -- they had a lavender honey latte recently that was amazing, if a little bit more sweet and syrupy than I usually splurge calories for. 

The space itself is cozy and neatly decorated. With all of the books they have out on shelves and comfy furniture, it'd be a great place to read an afternoon away. Also, the baristas I've had have all been friendly, and they crank out the drinks faster than you'd think possible. Very solid place overall!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2020-02-25,5,"I went in for the first time today and I will definitely be back! I was thrilled to see the amount of gluten free options. I got a honey lavender latte and one of each of the gluten free options, except for the breads. It was all delicious and the staff was accommodating! Looks like a great place to study or do work!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-12-17,5,"There are few places in the financial district that make me feel as welcomed as Ground Central. The baristas are always so sweet and know my order by heart. I get the dirty oat chai and its soooooo good. Their pastries are also always so good. Try the chocolate chip cookie, its amazing!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-12-17,2,"I came here on a recent morning after an appointment, since I hadn't had the chance to have coffee or breakfast earlier. Pretty disappointing. The space is really cute, but it felt chilly inside and they were blasting soulless music. The guy behind the counter was pretty robotic - didn't smile or show any friendliness at all. I had a coffee and a chocolate croissant. The croissant had barely any chocolate in it - I wouldn't say it tasted bad, but it was nothing exceptional. The coffee was too bitter. Maybe their lattes and other drinks are better there, I don't know. I'd try it again sometime to see if I had a better experience but this time it was quite eh and I didn't feel like staying long. (And the lack of a bathroom is a con as well)"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-12-07,5,"Such a cute place and has good coffee! It was pretty empty on a Saturday! If you're looking for a good coffee shop that isn't crazy crowded, this place is perfect!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-12-04,4,"Nice hipster spot, great pastries and coffee. Came here to study and was well pleased. It was very warm and cozy, free wi-fi, and one of my new favorite spots. 

On my 1st & 2nd visit, I had a cheddar scallion scone which I highly recommend, it reminds me of RL's cheddar bay biscuit minus the garlic. I also purchased a soy-vanilla mocha and it was very rich. 

And just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I went back a 3rd time and the barista recommended the spinach feta tomato turnover--it was simply delicious:  a nice flaky-buttery pastry with veggies and basil inside.

Only con is there's no bathroom.."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-11-18,5,Love this cute little coffeeshop. I always get my iced coffee from here and stay a while in the hidden nook to listen to my podcast before work. Theres always a little bit of a line in the morning but it moves quickly so thats awesome. They also have a tres leche donut Im in love with. The baristas always know my order and I like the neighborhood vibe here even though we're in FiDi.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-11-18,1,Came in for a coffee; rap music blasting overhead with foul language and homophobic slurs. Obnoxious barista; stay away if prefer common courtesy......
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-10-22,4,"Hipster coffee at its finest. 
Excellent location and inviting vibe, pretty decent cup of joe, and best of all - those alcove seats. 
I had 1.5 hour or so to get some work done and enjoyed coffee while sitting at the comfy couch in one of the two alcove areas. Unfortunately, they do not have outlet anywhere nearby so your time is limited but I think that's quite fair given the small space. There's also a central communal table that can seat 6 and those might have some access to an outlet but I am not sure. 
There's also seating outside for those who want to drench in the sun. Overall a great near-your-office cafe to meet up with a friend."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-10-19,5,"Shoutout to Hector who is always super friendly, and super fast.  My husband and I'm here every weekend, and their lattes are always on point.  Give Hector a raise!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-09-24,5,Love love!!! This place it's always so clean. You can sit outside on the patio. Fast pace and always nice workers. I'm a regular I work in the neighborhood. When I walk to the counter the cashier already know what I want. The drinks are so good my favorite is the Green Tea matcha latte with oat milk. The music is good too.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-09-19,3,"A cafe without a restroom. Stopped in here to grab an espresso and rest for a bit. When I got to the register, I asked about the restroom and they indicated they did not have a restroom and recommended going to a neighboring business.  Since I hadn't ordered, I left to find a cafe that could provide a better experience."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-08-08,4,I'm surprised that Ground Central also has a financial district location! It's smaller than those located midtown but it's still spacious enough to fit many people. I was excited to get donuts from doughnut plant and iced mocha. Iced mocha was good but I wonder what kind of chocolate they use...to me it tasted a lot like Hershey chocolate but I'm not certain.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-08-06,4,We brought some friends to FiDi for some sightseeing and found ourselves in need of an iced coffee in a bad way and found Ground Central to be a welcome respite from the heat. The line was out the door and we enjoyed our coffees outside on the benches in the plaza.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-08-03,1,"We arrived at 3:50pm to work on our laptops. When she gave us our drinks, the barista suddenly told us they were closing at 4pm. We wouldn't have dropped $11 to get drinks to stay for 5 minutes. 

Also, the chai was very overly sweet and tasted like it was from some gross syrup, we would not go back."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-05-08,5,"One of my favorite spots for reclusion or socializing in FiDi. Great lounging cubby sections with books and couches. Large comfortable benches on the Coenties Slip. Laid back environment decorated with dark metal and wood. To note, there is no restroom"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-04-13,3,"The barista was rude and laughed when we asked what is the most popular drink. So I ordered an iced americano and asked for light cream the barista said ""cream was on the counter"". Good coffee overall but bad service."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-03-30,3,We were here on a Saturday at around 3. This is a small place. We tried the cortardo coffee and it was ok. The place was not so clean. Looked like they didn't clean the trash area.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-03-22,1,I started working in the area a couple months ago and have been trying out each coffee shop in a five block radius to see which one is my favorite as there are so many seemingly good options. I've been here twice now for my post-lunch caffeine fix and have ruled this spot my least favorite by far. Very rude customer service. The pretentious and rude barista... what a tired cliche.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-03-08,5,"I love this place. It's my kind of hip filled with great baristas, cool music and comfy space. Today I walked in to Goth hour hearing sounds of Siouxsie and the Banshees and Sisters of Mercy, that made me happy. My cappuccino is yum!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-02-16,1,"House coffee was somewhat acidic and below average but the location was warming and nice. The hot mocha was hands down low grade, cold, watery, and simply way below acceptable !"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2019-01-16,2,"I was interested in trying ground central because it's closer to the office than my usual coffee place and they had a student discount sign in the front. I ordered a large matcha latte with coconut milk. I wish they updated their menu to include the oat milk option as I didn't see they had oat milk until it was too late. 

Their matcha latte is probably the worst one I've ever had. Its bright green but tastes like plain milk with 5 tablespoons of sugar and no matcha taste at all. Maybe their coffee is better but how can they mess up a matcha latte like this? I'm thankful I received a discount but very disappointed at the taste."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-12-15,5,"Like having lunch at a beach house. Great music, great vibe, beautiful layout, and a mostly attractive staff. I had an espresso shot, and it was delicious and effective. My girlfriend told me to relax like 5 times today. I recommend it for anyone who needs not just coffee, but some mental and emotional relief too. Will definitely be back."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-12-11,2,"Was very disappointed by my experience at Ground Central. There breakfast food lacks options and isn't anything to write a review about. Plus there service was some of the worst I experience of any coffee shop in the country. Only redeeming factors are location. The coffee and tea isn't too bad...but trendy coffee shops are a dime a dozen. No need to return for below average food, awful service, and just okay coffee. I will not be back."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-10-31,5,"I went to this Ground Central while visiting NYC last week and fell in love with this cute little coffee shop! It has a great vibe and a nice room with couches and tables to work in- plus a shelf of books if you wanted to take a little reading break. I had the pumpkin pie latte, and it really tasted like a liquid pie- not too sweet or artificial tasting! 

I was also fascinated by all the different baked goods available at the counter- they all looked delicious!! The male barista showed great customer service and told me about their different pastries and sandwiches and was really patient and helpful. I had a croissant du chocolat and it was super flaky and delicious. Overall great experience and I would recommend to anyone in the area!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-10-29,1,"Visited on a Monday morning about 11:30am. The music inside was turned up much too loud, thus not making it a good place to relax and go about your business while taking a coffee break.  I asked where the restroom was located and told they don't have one. Imagine that, a coffee shop where you can't use the restroom. Not convenient at all. Where do the employees go to use the restroom. Staff was not unfriendly but also didn't seem to care about being welcoming. There are far too many coffee places in the area to warrant coming back here."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-10-26,1,"If you're white, you'll love it here. If not, they'll ignore your order even if it's not busy. 

Sandwich was dry also so that didn't help. 

Very cute decore, but again, when the staff makes you feel uncomfortable and unwanted it doesn't make a difference. Wouldn't go again and wouldn't recommend.

Thanks for not making my lattee  enjoy your six dollar gratuity."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-10-25,2,Nice layout but music was too loud to carry on a conversation.  Also the long-haired Asian gentleman at the counter was among the surliest servers I've ever met and unceremoniously told us to leave when they closed without any forewarning
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-10-08,5,Great vibe - lots of energy without being noisy. Very comfortable chair with a place to put up my feet after waking for hours. Very good coffee. Pastries look great (little pricey). Baristas appropriately friendly. Would come back.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-10-07,5,Cute hidden spot. Coffee is great and service is amazing! Totally recommend coming here if your looking for good
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-09-19,5,"Open, airy space with maybe a recovered industrial decor. Cool music. Great pull of espresso. They make a freaking delicious cappuccino--a little small, but the proportions are right on. Small selection of carefully chosen pastries and what appear to be house-made sandwiches. Coenties Slip, a small urban park, is right out front for nice days. Imagine 4.5 stars. Well worth it."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-09-14,5,Super chill place to study. Nice atmosphere and the actual venue itself is a refreshing break from the skyscrapers. Has a rustic feel. Also great coffee!
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-06-13,4,"Nice coffee ""bar"" with a fun vibe, lots of sitting areas and outlets inviting people to work/study. Coffee was decently priced. However, no public restroom, that was a but of a bummer."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-06-04,4,"A very nice atmosphere to have a coffee with friends or to study. There are couches in semi private sections and outdoor seating. 
The last time i was here I had a nice time sipping my green tea latte and studying until a pesky fly landed on the rim of my open cup a couple times and refused to leave me alone."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-05-14,2,"First of all their prices aren't that inexpensive. Secondly, there is no restroom here. Lastly, the WiFi does not work."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-05-09,5,"Such a great atmosphere, with nooks and crannies for those who want to have a more private chat or space to study. Great decor and although I have not had the coffee - the green tea latte does not disappoint. A bit pricey, but all over wonderful coffee shop. Love that it is near the office!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-05-05,5,The coffee here is really good. One of the better coffee shops in the Financial District. The chocolate croissant was perfect too.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-02-15,5,"My favorite coffee spot in the area. The cappuccinos are delicious, they have oat milk, they're crazy fast, and they remember my order. I never really hang out there but they have nice nooks with leather sofas/armchairs that look very inviting. Good playlist too, pleasant and not overwhelming or too loud."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-02-14,4,"Delicious GF pastries - I tried the GF sugar donut and the chocolate coconut scone, both satisfied my sweet tooth and actually very yummy.

The cafe itself is very dainty and great for working too. The service is pretty quick in the morning."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2018-02-13,4,"Get the green tea matcha latte! The vibe in this place is cool, it's a little bit loud but I didn't mind it. The coffee is good and as an assortment of sandwich options as well. I seriously love it here. One of my new favorite spots."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-12-23,5,"This place is awesome. Book program, quite spot to read. Wish I brought my book. Charging spot for phones. Oh and the coffee is great too. Friendly staff and fast."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-11-01,1,"Used to be my favorite coffee shop in the area up until today. Went in, no people on front of me - great! Ordered large hot matcha. When the drink is made - it's a size small. No problem, I told the lady I ordered a size large. She said she'll redo it. BUT! Instead of preparing a new drink she just poured the size small in a large cup and simply added steamed milk. Really??? I had no time to wait for another drink to be made nor did I want to complain so I just left frustrated drinking my hot milk with a little matcha hint:( probably won't come again and will look for another place."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-10-22,3,I love the location of this place is super cute inside and I LOVE the little benches to sit outside! Prices are really good for a coffee shop especially for fidi. The actual coffee itself is ok not the greatest tasting.but everything else as far ambience goes is great!
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-09-07,2,"Ordered an Americano. The menu board seemed to lack any info on which of their beans/roasts are available as an Espresso/Americano, which are drip, etc. The coffee was not very good. Ratio of espresso to hot water seemed way off (too much water). Crema was absent. Tasted of not very much - even though it was supposed to be made with a medium roast. The place seemed nice - good place to hang out if a little busy/loud. For great coffee, there are better options in the neighborhood e.g. Cafe Grumpy."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-08-26,5,"Great vibe and cool atmosphere. Seating is well designed and eclectic. Really friendly staff and excellent coffee. What more do you need?  They let me try the Nitro cold brew; ended up ordering a hot coffee, but the gesture was great."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-08-21,2,"Right now, draft cold brew coffee is all the craze. When I see a smaller brand company (not a Starbucks), I like to try and see their take on it. I stepped into Ground Central in FiDi on such an occasion.  They had a nitro keg outside (cash only) or full serve inside. I opted for inside.

First impressions were good. The layout was inviting with a large communal table to either work or drink or both. The counter area was nice and the decor had enough wood and black pipe fixtures to make sure you knew in the right spot.

When I ordered, I quickly got the feeling this was no more than a novelty to the staff and not a 'real offering'. I asked what type of creamers did they have and was told I could add afterwards. I thought to myself how is that going to work?  You see, when you pour a draft, it's going to have a silky smooth head with rolling bubbles of nitro. If I disturb it by adding a creamer afterwards, it's going to introduce a bunch of oxygen and kill the coffee. I ordered anyway. It came out and their gas is off ratio. It came out flat and with a head comparable to Beetlejuice towards the end of the movie. Very disappointing. Clearly the staff does not know how to draw a nitrogen draft. Lastly, I was given a standard plastic top with a straw hole. So if it wasn't bad enough, I was now being asked to drill a hole and directly insert oxygen down the bottom of my draft!

Long and short, the coffee was not prepared properly and the blend was a flat uneventful cold brew. I will try them for another drink in the future, but I do not recommend the nitro."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-08-02,4,"My favorite coffee shop in this part of the financial district.  I way prefer it to Gregory's.  Four stars because they don't have a bathroom, but the coffee is excellent."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-07-12,4,"Ground Central is a perfect little study spot! There are two little secluded pods with a leather loveseat, chair, and ottoman in each. These little pods are cozy and have books all around. This really gives the place a good vibe. There is also a larger table in the center of the shop to sit, too. I had an iced coffee with hazelnut and it was pretty good! I'm anxious to try more on their menu! This spot is very fun & relaxed & I would go back again! AC, free wifi, minimal outlets but you can find some. Everyone that comes in always seems to be friendly, too. A few people struck up conversations with me while I was there. Overall, it's a very pleasant vibe for a great place!!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-06-27,1,Cold brew that's $5.25 and tastes like fricking K-cup coffee and rude people behind the counter? Unbelievable.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-06-11,4,"Ignore my last review, I heart their nitro-cold brew.  I'm so happy I gave them another shot.  The nitro cold brew was smooth and delicious.  I've finally found my favorite coffee near the office."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-06-09,5,"This latte made my day!

Delicious espresso. I enjoyed my almond milk latte from here. Really cute place with a bunch of seating outside. Much better than the mermaid!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-06-04,2,"They've got some nice looking couches, but forget about getting a seat on them, because they let people who never ordered anything just hang out on them all day."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-05-15,4,"I had a business meeting with a conservative/formal client from Korea.  I used Yelp to read reviews for coffee shops in the Lower Mahattan/Wall St. area where we might meet.  The issue with most coffee shops in NYC is that there isn't much seating or that The shop is usually long, narrow and crowded.  The reviews and photos showed that the space seemed large (and square) and that there was seating indoors and out.  The coffee also got good reviews.  

When we met up there, my client gushed about the place (it's kind of a mix between quaint and ""Brooklyn rustic"").  He also seemed very happy that we could sit outside on what was a beautiful afternoon. The expresso was above average.  I am hapoy I picked this place and would suggest going here again to other clients who want to meet downtown.

One note is that the folks behind the counter were not chatty which is usually what I get (and like) in my neighborhood, but they probably get so many more customers there that they don't have time (or energy) to chat with everyone.  No stars taken off for that.  

This place is above-average coffee, above-average space and has bonus outdoor seating.  Two thumbs up!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-05-12,4,"This place is swanky and the coffee is really good. They have some couches and padded seats as well as tables and stools.

You can come to work or have a private conversation in one of the two semi private areas.

The Lattes are delicious and flavorful and I would recommend getting a cup and just sitting down and enjoying the view."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-05-06,5,"This is my favorite place to get coffee near my office! I usually do an Americano, or during the summer months, iced Americano or cold brew. A bit pricey on the cold brew, but that's normal. And it's really good cold brew."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-04-02,5,"I imagine it'd be really packed here when it gets a lot warmer into the spring and summer! It's a small spot that's perfect for getting some work done and catching up with friends. The coffee shop has these two awesome nooks with leather seats, almost like booths. It also has a large long table in the middle as well as outdoor seating for up to ~8 people. There is free wifi, which is always awesome.

I ordered a flat white and it was one of the better flat whites I've had! The flavor of the coffee in the drink was on point. It was a little chilly outside so I felt as if it warmed me up! Would definitely come back here!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-04-02,3,My go to for a coconut milk mocha but they really should update their store hours on Yelp. This location does not open on Sun. Found this out the hard way several weeks back.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-03-25,5,"Love this little oasis from all the chaos of working in the financial district area. Everytime I've visited, it has never been too crowded, lattes are smooth and delicious, and service is friendly and efficient. The little crevices with leather seats are perfect when you want to have some quiet conversation or just need a moment to yourself. 

and YAY for this spot being on the CUPS app. $5 sign up credit: t5vwa :)"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-03-19,5,"This place is awesome.  Cannot believe I have lived in neighborhood 9 years and just recently stumbled upon this place.  (Not sure how long it has been here?)  There is plenty of comfortable seating here, including neat little semi-private alcoves.  Kind of like you at at Sherlock Holmes's house.  Also I assume the nice seating area outside will be great when the weather warms up.  The coffee was delicious and they have an awesome custom Italian espresso machine with some beautiful patriotic art inlay.  Nice staff too."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-02-13,5,Came here to escape the cold and found ourselves staying for 3 hours. The staff was so friendly And helpful. Barista recommended the cherry mocha and a cinnamon bun latte. Both tasted like they were made with love. My personal fav was the cinnamon bun. The atmosphere was exceptionally comfortable and cozy. We noticed a leather sofa in a nook and were in heaven. I'd highly recommend this place.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-02-13,5,I've only had the coffee here and it is fantastic.  Definitely one of my top favorites in the Financial District.  The service is also really great and the baristas are all very nice and welcoming.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-02-03,3,Super cute place and free wifi but not coming back because there is no restroom. A place to do work while drinking coffee with no bathroom makes zero sense to me.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2017-02-02,3,"I give it 3 stars because while their coffee is good and space is nice, they do not have public restrooms and the wifi is terrible. I used my own hot spot and planned to hang out for awhile to work (it is a great working spot) but at some point one must use a restroom and if you've posted up for a productive day you'll have to pack up every time and cross the street... not ideal for a coffee shop that is clearly set up for a long term stay."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-12-29,5,The services is always impeccable- the bistros always know how my soy latte needs to be made and more importantly the ambiance is unique
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-12-28,3,"Ordered a soy chai latte.  The drink was mediocre.  Maybe it was just too early in the morning or the barista was new.  There was too much cinnamon, not enough ginger flavor and the drink was lukewarm.  Basically tasted like flavored spiced soy milk.  I really expected a better drink because the other Ground Central locations in the city make an excellent soy chai latte and the baristas were really nice."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-11-17,5,"Nice mix of cozy and industrial design aesthetics. Has warm touches like tucked away corners and bookshelves but also an efficient main floor that has become the norm in the city, particularly near high flow areas.

Love this place. I have been to the Midtown-East location and now this one is my new go-to spot downtown. It is a short walk from the ferry and right in the midst of FiDi. 

My favorite individual touch here was the set of wooden benches located on the porch but only accessible from the inside. It has a private feel although it is outside since its your own little area to have a conversation or read a good book.

I discovered this through the Cups app and you can use code ""yyskl"" to have $10 to spend here with no other obligation, which I appreciated. My tip with the app is to make sure the item you want is listed the same way."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-11-10,2,"Was excited that they brought one of these downtown. The inside is really well done, staff was very nice but coffee was a bit overpriced. I also got the cold brew and was excited that it was the Nitro version (nitrogen infused). However, the end result was that it tasted like cheese. I know sounds funny but got it again the next day and same result. Weird cheesy, burrata taste. very little coffee finish. Guess back to Gregory's I go..."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-11-04,4,"Its such a cute and comfortable place, they have two corners that have leather seats. They also have an outdoor seating area and large table in the middle (which was great for studying). They have a great music playlist going on too. I stumbled upon this cafe using the CUPS app and it includes small and large drinks in their plan. I ordered the matcha latte, it was good but was a bit too sweet for my taste. 

Overall, Ground Central was very comfortable and I would recommend their drinks! Its a bonus that it's only a couple minutes from the Staten Island ferry terminal. It would be a great pit stop!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-11-04,5,The best coffee shop to study at near Stone Street! Great rustic atmosphere! Check out this site about Ground Central Coffee #3 and other coffee shops to study at in NYC here: suzysstudyspotsnyc.blogspot.com
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-10-26,5,"When you love every sip of the cup you're holding, you know it's a good Joe!! What better way to enjoy when it's FREE!! Try their CUPS app and use the CODE: fenel~ Enjoy~"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-10-17,5,"EASILY the BEST TASTING COFFEE in the Financial District, with a super-cool vibe to boot! You honestly cannot go wrong with G.C. The staff is super-friendly, helping to start your morning off right, and every single thing I've had here is off-the-charts delicious! I unequivocally recommend the Cheese Brioche, as others have mentioned. It is SO good! Plus, the normal drip-coffee tastes like it's fresh from a coffee farm in Costa Rica or similar--the chocolatey aroma will honestly wisp all your cares away and have your tastebuds dancing with delight! No need to add milk or sugar, though you certainly can, this coffee is perfect just like it is! Cozy up to one of the best cups of mojo you've ever had at Ground Central in the FiDi."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-10-14,4,"I started working near FiDi about two months ago, and I'm so glad one of my co workers brought me here for a coffee break. 

This coffee shop is very cozy and hipster (although everything is considered hipster these days). They have a small area with couches and a bookshelf with tons of books, which is the perfect place to relax and take a break. 

Because I was having a sugar craving at the time, I got the Mocha with coconut milk (costs a little extra but so worth it!) The Mocha had rich, dark chocolate and the coconut milk complemented it well. I loved it so much that I raved about to my coworkers. Their regular coffee is good, but not amazing. The prices are slightly less pricey than other coffee shops around the area (i.e. Starbucks, Financier, etc.) 

I'm giving four stars mainly for the Mocha, which I'm in love with!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-10-12,5,"Ground central is so cute. I love the ambiance and the coffee is really good . The chocolate mocha is the best in the city. The prices are like Starbucks, maybe a little cheaper but still one of the higher priced coffee places. 

They have a couple locations but the one downtown is very close to my work and never has a line. 

I come here at least once a week. You should too!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-10-05,1,"Ridiculous service. I went there and ordered a cappuccino. It was the Luke's diner coffee day. I was given a coffee without a sleeve. And when asked, they said its over. In front of me people ordered coffee n got sleeves. How can one serve a hot coffee without sleeve. How can one lie. Highly disappointed with the attitude of the employees"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-10-01,4,"Ground Central is really cute.  Staff is really friendly and doesn't take too long for your drink to come out.  I've had the iced latte and the chai tea there and both were very tasty.  There is a good amount of seating and different seating areas with outdoor space as well.  Only complaint I have is that the coffee is way overpriced.  There is a lot of competition in FiDi and I don't think the product is reflective of the price, as what i've tried so far has been good, not excellent."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-09-28,4,Has a chill vibe compared to other financial district coffee shops. I enjoy working here and having the option to still connect to wifi on the little porch (so cute).  I haven't had anything I ate here that has been anything to good or bad enough to comment on. Coffee is very good though.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-09-25,5,"Not much of a coffee drinker. Stopped by for some water and a snack. The almond croissant was literally one of the greatest things I've ever put in my mouth, and I've tasted some pretty amazing things in my life. Staff was super friends too and great vibes on the porch. If I could give a 6th star. I would."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-09-18,5,"*Beyond Friendly Staff.
*Super Chill comfy lay out,lots of sofas/seating area.
*Despite the long line, it looks as if you get your coffee pretty quickly, your in and out.
I like this place a lot and jeez if your going to visit a coffee joint in the middle of the Financial District please expect to pay a tad bit more for good quality stuff. Take your self down the street to Dunkin if you can't handle prices.
Over all so far so good will be back!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-09-04,3,"Ground central always bring me mixed feelings. My almond cappuccino felt a bit burnt - bitterness too strong that I have to add honey. Yet I enjoyed my time there. Big comfy sofas and shelves of books inside, two set of benches on the balcony. It's a comfortable and quiet place where I can spend hours reading and writing. I'd rather this place not noticed by others for the latter reason =)"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-08-25,2,"I stopped here with a client for a quick impromptu meeting.  The place was pretty empty in late afternoon.

Mediocre service:
I was really surprised that on a hot August day there was no decaf iced coffee.   So, no big deal, the barista offered me a decaf with ice poured on top.  I asked her to leave room for me to add milk.  Before I received my coffee, I was given an credit card option to leave a tip.  Pretty lame for counter service.  Still, having been a waitress myself for a million years, I of course left a tip.  When she handed me the coffee, she had forgotten to leave room for the milk, again no biggie.  I asked her to pour some out for me, she answered, ""Well, there's a sink over there.  You can do it yourself,"" as she rolled her eyes at me.  

Oh, forgive me, I just left you a tip for doing, um nothing.

No bathroom:
Ok.  So I know they don't HAVE to have a bathroom, but seeing as it's in the heart of a tourist district they really ought to have one.  Sorry folks, but the essence of coffee is that it makes you have to go!  Come on.  

The lack of a bathroom pretty much ended my meeting (since, well, you know I had to GO!) and any chance that I'll go back."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-08-24,4,"Finally decided to download the Cups app and used my $5 sign up credit here. I changed my drink last minute from a latte to a dirty chai (paid for dirty chai on the app) but ended up with a regular latte, which was pretty tasty. Not a huge deal because this was essentially free with the app. I planned to also get something for breakfast, but nothing looked super appealing. I wanted something other than a pastry. Might come back and try the lunch sandwiches. 

Nice to have something other than Starbucks or Dunkin since I try to visit independent shops. Nice space inside and a small covered patio out front."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-08-23,4,"Excellent nitro coffee. So smooth. Small Fire Escape Balcony with seats and comfy interior, too."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-08-17,5,"This place has the best tasting coffee in the area. It is better than Bluestone, Gregory's, Starbucks, the Organic on Broadway or Bluespoon. It is never burnt, instead it has a velvety sort or flavor. Yes I know velvety isn't a flavor but that's my description and I'm sticking with it. The place is super cute and the staff is friendly and on the ball. I don't always have the time to walk the few extra blocks for an afternoon cup, but whenever I do I am glad I did."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-08-05,5,"Get their Nitro Cold Brew ($5 but treat yo self) or their dirty chai latte. Their banana chocolate chip bread is AMAZING too! Also, shoutout to Shannon for being super kind and helpful! Told her I worked in the neighborhood and she got me hooked up with a loyalty card in seconds. They are on CUPS app so that's a perk too if you like coffee apps."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-08-02,4,"Really like this spot; whoever handles their interior design did a great job. It's an ideal spot to grab a coffee or latte especially on a rainy day because it's so warm and inviting. 
The chai latte with almond milk was great as was the macchiato. Baristas have all been friendly. Price point is typical of NYC, which is just a necessary evil here."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-07-23,4,"Cool place to hang-out, nice coffee! They accept MyCups plan, where you can reduce the price of the coffee or even get it for free. But they dont have WC for tourist like me it is essentail."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-07-18,2,"Good coffee, nice people. This was my third visit and for the first time I ordered a cold brew. But did I just really pay for $5 for a SMALL cold brew?! Damn. Not everyone in Financial District is a banker! The price shown on the online menu for the same item is less than $4 if I remember correctly (as of this writing). They really need to update the site - I'm sure they have enough funds from these overpriced cold brews to take few minutes to reflect correct prices on their own website...!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-07-13,2,Horrible service. The Tall Spanish looking pastry girl was so rude to me. She rushed me to order and than skipped me. When she finally did take my order she forgot to write it on a cup so my order took an extra 10 minutes. Btw she threw the cup at the barista (literally). It was my first time here and I hated it which is a shame because the place looks so nice. The barista ( tall with beard) was really nice and made me a beautiful and delicious flat white. Whoever owns or manages this place should fire that girl because she sucks and gives this place a bad name.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-06-28,2,"I've given Ground Central the benefit of the doubt. I went 3 times because it's close to where I live and the place looks really nice and I thought that they must know how to make good coffee. Three out of three times my latte was awful. Excessively liquid, excessively hot. I had to wait 5 minutes before I could start sipping it. If you claim you are a coffee shop you simply can't screw a basic drink like a caffe' latte 100% of the time. Not acceptable."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-06-21,5,"New favorite coffee place in the hood. Friendly baristas, great coffee, and super dope decor with a nod to the neighborhood."

Four Stars

On this very pleasant but hot summer day, I happened along Ground Central Coffee. I went inside and ordered a large Nitro Cold Brew (it usually costs $5.5) but using the Cups App. It was less than $3. Use Promo Code: 25pn5 for a free $10 credit. I like blackboard style menu. The staff was friendly. There was a lot of seating: a large communal table, a three person window bar, some faux leather booths, a patio with four park benches, plus there is a big plaza out front. They have an Outside express line for those just wanting a cup of coffee and featured pastry. 

The cold brew was mildly bubbly, low acidity, clean tasting and overall one of the best cold brews in the city thus far."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-06-09,5,"Great alternative to Starbucks. Much better coffee, good choice of pastries. Nice interior too."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-06-02,5,"Great coffee & food. Not many coffee options in FiDi that aren't Starbucks or some other generic spot, but Ground Central makes up for that!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-06-01,5,"I'll be honest... When I saw there was going to be another coffee shop, I figured it was a waste of space with Starbucks being right around the block. However, this place blows Starbucks away. Quality of service and quality of their products will make this place thrive. Check them out!!"
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-06-01,3,"C'mon Yelp -- where's your algorithm that's supposed to catch nonsense reviews? Really? 5 stars? Here's the deal: the coffee here is good. The pastries are absolutely ridiculously overpriced -- a tiny sliver of banana bread for 4 dollars AND nothing special about the banana bread. In many ways, this reminds me of RBC coffee which opened in Tribeca and was closed within a year -- the problem? Pricing. This morning a small coffee and a tiny piece of so-so banana bread cost me over $6! Now, I was willing to pay that depending upon how good the food was (see below). 

With so much cheap coffee within a 2 block radius of this place, they will not survive unless they build volume; they will not build volume unless they attract people; they will not attract people with $4+ muffins and breads which are nothing to write home about and can be gotten for half the price at DD and even S'bucks. I have been here many times (10+) and it's a nice, comfortable atmosphere, but, surprisingly, it's usually empty even at 9 a.m. -- a bad sign for a 5 star coffee spot. It's placement in traffic could not be more perfect; it's ambiance is superb, coffee is fine...must be the PRICING that's keeping people away. The trick with pricing is to walk on the edge so people don't feel like they got robbed. At Gregory's, they have some expensive breads and pastries (about the same price as this place) but they are huge and awesome -- you feel like you've eaten a meal when you're done. Same at Colombe. Though I detest FIKA, their pastries are at least very unusual and very good. Here, I truly felt like I had a pastry sample at my local bakery. That small. That expensive. That meh. 

I do not expect to change anything with my Yelp reviews, but I always endeavor to do a service to other yelpers and sometimes to the vendors. Slapping 5 stars on this place does neither. If it wasn't a chain, I'd be more sympathetic, but there just no reason other than greed to mark food up over 300% (the standard) without (I repeat) the food being WOW quality. 

Bottom line: coffee good; pastries comically overpriced in a way that will guarantee no one buys them (twice). Result: a solid 3 stars."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-05-30,5,this was our go-to morning spot each day of our trip while staying at the andaz Wall Street.  the coffee is excellent - they serve nitro for their cold brew - and their cheese brioche is the best I've had.  staff is pleasant and efficient.  their iced tea is great also. highly recommend.
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-05-27,5,"What a nice surprise, new GC coffee in FiDi. Cute and chic decor, sofa library nook to cozy patio bench nooks. Perfect spot for browsing Internet or a break from office. if you like Dough donut, they carry them, quick bite sandwiches and pastries. Next to Stone street, in case you need to wake up after your arduous after work HH drinking with the coworkers..."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-05-19,5,"Being a coffee connoisseur, I'm always looking for a good cup of coffee.  Well, I found it.  It's right in the financial district. Ground Central Coffee 3 is a quaint place with friendly staff and great service.

If you are in the area try Ground Central 3 and you will be a fan as well."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-05-10,4,"I came in here looking for a tasty morning coffee, so this review is just concerned with the quality of their regular drip coffee.

EDIT: I originally wrote a bad review of their coffee, saying it was stale-tasting and watery, and said I preferred the drip coffee at La Colombe. The manager emailed me saying they used La Colombe beans, which made me question my judgement, so I went and bought a cup of coffee from each business and did a double-blind taste test.

They don't taste the same, but after the test I checked which cup I preferred and it turned out to be from this place. So, I'm changing my review from 2 stars to 4. I will be getting my coffee from here going forwards because it's closer to my office."
11,ground-central-new-york-5,2016-05-08,5,"Wonderful coffee shop this area needs. WiFi, gluten-free macarons, good music, big tables and power outlets."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2020-07-08,5,This place is amazing. The customer service is one of the best experiences I have had in New York. They are really fast with getting to customers and are really polite. The place is also really clean and asthetically pleasing
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2020-06-25,5,Mustafa is the best! The service is amazing and the staff is so nice. They even let me control the aux and play my own music. The food and hookah was amazing!!
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2020-06-01,5,"For all your lock-down kebab needs!!

Ordered the mix grill for delivery which was a very generous portion and actually had me beat!   It came with a generous portion of rice and salad, but the kebabs and lamb chop were my favorites and were well washed down with a couple of fruity house cocktails. 

The delivery came with with extra pita, fresh humus & a few slices of baklava...which were much appreciated and enjoyed!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2020-05-16,5,"I ordered delivery from here and the food was good! I got the mezze for two and the lamb shank. It came in good portions and was hot upon arrival which was great. They also included a nice note saying thank you for supporting us, and included an extra strawberry drink (which was light and refreshing) and baklava."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2020-05-13,5,"I just ordered delivery from here and I am SO impressed. Not only was the food delicious (and there was a ton of it)-but the restaurant included a side salad, Hot pita bread, hummus, AND some baklava! Extremely sweet and generous of them!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2020-03-17,4,Personally I liked the place. But the ambiance isn't for everybody. The music is good in my opinion if you like hip hop/ rap/ reggaeton. We ordered a pineapple hookah mango and mint flavor. The hookah last about an hour and a half. I really like that they brought out a plastic hose and opened it in front of us. We order hummus which was plenty for about 4 people. We also got 2 shots Sahara blue and black magic. The shots are strong and in a mini mason which are equivalent to 2 shots! Very casual place.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2020-02-29,5,Always my go to spot ! The hookah is always good it's about $22 now but I will still go; never a coverage even after hours .. music is well too
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2020-01-24,5,"Love the vibes!!!! Great music great hookah. 
The service was great and the waiter was so attentive  would definitely recommend"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2020-01-24,3,Literally the most average hookah place you can go to. Consistently average. If you're in the area then checK it out. Wouldn't go out of my way to smoke here
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2020-01-12,4,"Hookah bars in general are a hit or miss. Mostly miss. Most of the time they're overpriced and unauthentic. This place on the other hand felt a bit more authentic. I liked the outdoor tent area, service was fast, hookah is good, alcohol prices are really good which is surprising. we got hummus to share and we could tell that it's authentic and homemade. Would come back in the future."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2020-01-03,4,"I had a great time at Sahara East, it was a very good hookah lounge. I enjoyed the drinks as well we drank two pitchers of mojito, mango and guava it was very flavorful. Also the hookah was very cleanly they gave every person a fresh mouthpiece. We also ordered French fries and they were freshly made, with great seasoning. The customer service was attentive, the waiter was very aware to our needs and he made no mistakes."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-12-23,1,Fucked up place. Worst service and they charged so much extra. Don't even bother busting there!
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-12-16,5,This place is really the shit been here Twice and let me tell you there HOOKAHS AMAZING really last up to one hour without changing flavor only the coal (& it never   Taste burnt !!!!! Drinks are so good Highly recommend the MOJITO lol that shit hit ! ( LOVELY CUSTOMER SERVICE )Thinking about throwing my Birthday party here with a couple of friends On Friday Dec 20th yerrrrrr You already know.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-12-14,5,Ive been going here for years amazing service great and great vibes. Nice ambiance and great colors. Outside in the summertime two sides as well. They dont have henny but its some good drinks and they have great staff. They have heavy shots and you will enjoy yourself.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-12-13,5,Stopped by on a rainy Friday evening. We were helped quickly and given a better table once it opened. My chicken kabobs and rice were cooked fresh and absolutely delicious. I was also encouraged to bring the included hummus home since I didn't want any in the restaurant. The portion was more than fair as well as the price. We were also gifted with complimentary rice pudding. Would love to visit again!
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-11-16,3,"Been there twice the hookah is ok, the food wasn't bad, the staff is nice ish depending on who u get, the inside space is not big but I love the outdoor space in the back. The prices are not bad the music is ok. Overall it's an alright place."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-11-01,5,This is my favorite hookah spot.Its a chili vibe and the hookah flavors are amazinggggggg.The prices are amazing as well I didn't have to break my pockets. I highly recommend this for a chill low key date or a night out with the girls.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-10-31,5,The atmosphere is nice & the service was great...Pauline is super cool...try his special drink too

So many interesting flavors of hookah as  well . The Drinks were affordable and tasted amazing. The music was litttt too would definitely recommend this place if your interested in a low key spot to vibe in"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-10-22,5,Sahara East is my favorite hookah spot in NYC. The food and drinks are good and the hookah last forever. The service is amazing and they always make us feel at home! 10/10 would recommend!
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-10-09,4,"Quick recap: cool joint for a good hookah session, amazing tea (minus hibiscus) and decent service. Worth checking out if you're in the area. 

Hookah here is reasonably priced, the vibe is pretty laid back, and the area is clean. The outdoor patio space is great. 

Clover tea was amazing. Hibiscus tea was not. Didn't get any food but people around us did and it looked/smelled incredible."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-10-02,4,Chicken wings pretty good! Had so much fun with my gals hope to come back again soon!
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-10-02,5,"Best hookah prices in 20 miles. The hookah has long lasting flavor, and the servers are attentive. There's many hookah flavors and you can mix and match. The servers will consistently change the charcoal and they clearly care about customer satisfaction.
Food is great and authentic Lebanese.

12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-09-19,5,Love the hookah here. The best part of my experience is always PAULIE! Paulie is the absolute best. Ask for Paulie!

12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-09-05,5,"Sahara East is a wonderful place to come and just hang out with your friends. Beautiful environment, with a friendly staff. Paulie was a great waiter, very nice and humble and allowed us to even get on the aux. great place and atmosphere, will definitely be coming here again."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-08-26,5,"This place makes some of the best hookah in the city! And when it comes to food, make sure to ask for Paulie -- he takes pride in what he cooks and it always comes out fantastic!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-08-25,5,"PAULIE! PAULIE is the man, he is the greatest and is the main reason I come here over others. Sahara east is an oasis in the vast and arid desert called  New York City. It's back terrace is the perfect place to spend time outside with a hookah and friends. The pina coladas are to die for and the tap water is great! The ambience and interior decor is evocative of another era, one where life could be just as simple as you, a pina colada, and blooming nicotine addiction"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-08-21,5,Great service nice people and help you with what you need no attitudes. great ambiance two sides to choose from inside. Inside lounge outside lights and lanterns. great music urban sounds and calm vibes.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-08-14,5,This has got to be one of the best hookah spots in New York !! Everyone should go here !!
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-08-13,5,"Sahara is the best, Their food is really good and always is very presentable. Would definitely reccomend friends"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-08-02,5,"Excellent customer service, attentive, quick seating, friendly staff. Paulie is the bestest!!!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-08-01,5,I've been coming to Sahara East for years.....this place is my getaway and favorite spot to take my friends and girlfriend. The staff are basically a second fam. Shouts to Petey and Ahmed
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-07-19,5,"I love this place! Ive been going here for years.  Great indoor and outdoor space. Hookah is good. Great service. The people that work here are very attentive. No need to ask for fresh coals, they're on it! Pauly is my absolute favourite person to see!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-07-13,1,They lied about the free hookah if you give them a review they are buying review I do not recommend this place it's a very dishonest establishment next bar it is
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-07-08,3,"- Lots of hookah flavors
- The food and drinks are really good
- They play good music and sometimes when it gets really fun, they'll let you choose the music! 
- There's indoor and outdoor seating 
- You'll have to get someone's attention to change the coals. Service could be better
- 18% automatic gratuity charge
- It's fun to come with a group of friends and just relax
- Chill environment"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-07-02,5,Favorite Hookah place in NY. I bring all my friends here for a lowkey chill environment. Love there fries and Turkish coffee! Ice hose and grapefruit head? Genius! The Hookah is literally the length of my legs and I'm 6foot 3. Will be there this weekend with friends too.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-07-02,5,"The food is delicious, the hookah is great. Would definitely recommend, the prices are very reasonable and the music is great"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-07-01,5,"Been coming to Sahara East since 2014 and it's still my favorite after hours spot. The staff treats my family like their family, it's definitely our ""Cheers"" the hookah is always great!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-06-29,5,Floor manager's attentiveness to service satisfaction and personally getting his hands dirty - is what every establishment needs.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-06-16,4,"cute, chill, dope staff, yummy food and drinks. a nice night out! 
ordered: the sahara wings with fries and a mojito"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-06-01,5,"Love this place, great atmosphere and service. Nice outdoor space with good music!! I came here with my best friends to celebrate the end of the school year and, to be honest, was just looking for a place to chill. But the vibe was so great! Totally blew my expectations. Food was great, hookah even better!! Get mango mint, trust me."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-05-18,5,"Great service, good music! Hookah is cheap and good! I've been coming here for years. Great spot!!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-05-05,5,Great spot good music .. good hookah .. FOOD IS ALWAYS ON POINT .. just be a lil busy on Friday and Saturdays gotta be patient ..  great for a group event .. or a date night ..
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-05-01,5,Great service. My regular go to spot. Vibe is chill during the day. Fun vibes at night. Also good to watch sports up front.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-04-29,5,Amazing!! This place is the best. Love the sheesha & the atmosphere! Must goooo  #worthit #bluemist #fries #nycspot #lemondrops
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-04-25,5,This place is amazing!! The staff is so friendly and always welcoming.  The music is great and they often let us request songs.  Love coming here!
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-04-15,4,"Hookah was really good, changing coals service was excellent, didn't need to request they kept coming back to change the coal. It took them sometime to get us the check upon request, the server mentioned they were busy in the kitchen. Would still go back for the hookah!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-03-23,5,"Favorite place to go for some great drinks, food and hookah. An absolute must. I came here for a friends birthday and we had so much fun. The manager was wonderful and he also sang my friend happy birthday. I come here very often with friends!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-03-20,5,"Soups are delicious. 
Also the kibbeh was very tasty. 
Good waiter service !!
Nice ambiance."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-03-09,5,Amazing hookah & service! Paulie the host with the most! He makes you feel at home & prepares the best drinks!
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-03-07,5,Amazing service! Great staff and overall great atmosphere. I will definitely become a regular costumer.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-02-28,5,"GREAT Customer service , GREAT vibe , GREAT , drinks. Such a nice place to go when you had a LONG week and you just need to be surrounded by great energy , drinks and awesome food!!! Definitely recommended, BEST hookah spot on Bowery!!!!!!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-02-22,5,"This place is AMAZING! I've had a birthday party there, and I have came multiple times. The service is fabulous, and the hookah is great. 10 stars!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-02-07,5,"A great chill place to go after work for drinks. Ahmed and all of the staff is very very prompt, very friendly and welcoming. The hookah is great, try Ahmed's favorite, the grape. The music creates such a nice atmosphere to either talk chill or turn up, your choice. Walked in with a friend on a whim and definitely do not regret it and will be back"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-01-08,5,Great hookah place in the area with drinks and food. Nice atmosphere chill lighting and music. Came here with friends and had a great time.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-01-08,5,Ahmed is the homie. No matter what he will hook you up with what you need. Been coming here for years never a disappointment.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-01-08,5,Sahara east is a fun place to go with friends. Their hookah flavors are awesome because  there are so many options. Also their food is randomly amazing. No kidding everything is delicious. Chicken and hummus so fresh and delicious!!!  highly recommend for two or a big group.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-01-08,5,"My go to place for years. Cheap, amazing service, great drink and hookah! Rose is my favorite flavor. the fruit ones are good too. I also recommend the sangria. Food is also good. Service is so attentive and friendly. I've eaten here a few time as well and the food is solid! Overall fab place- def come for a night out!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-01-08,5,"Great service, assortment of hookah flavors and the food was pretty good and quick. Hamed was the man and was a great waiter."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-01-04,1,"The server had no people skills and made me feel very unwelcome. Would barely even speak to me, but was fine to other customers around me. I had to track him down just to pay. Made it seem because I wasn't Muslim or middle eastern I was unwelcome."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2019-01-01,1,"When you have it posted that you get a free hookah if you leave a 5 star review, then tell us its not ?!  No thanks."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-12-29,5,"Good drinks and hookah, they have fresh fruit that you can smoke the hookah from. The front is a bit small but they have a nice big back area."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-12-26,5,Idk why this place is being rated so poorly. All the servers have been very friendly to me every time I've been here. The hookah pulls very well and the food is DELICIOUS!! The only downside is they don't have top shelf liquor but the beer selection is good. Also the music and atmosphere is cool and it's within the same price range as all the hookah places in the area.Would recommend.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-12-15,5,"I love coming here!! The service is great, the fries are bomb and the music is always bumping. Definitely my go-to hookah bar and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun night."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-12-09,2,"Decent hookah. That's the only positive here. 

The servers are not friendly. This is a cash only place. When I went out to get some cash from ATM the server tried to pester my friends for money, saying that his shift was ending at 7pm. Even after 9pm this server is still here. Nobody in this place know what they are doing. They can't answer a single question. They made us pay for our check even though we were not done ordering. 

Stay away from this place if you want a good experience."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-10-23,5,"Fire drinks . Very nice staff and some great hookahs. Some good ass music !!! 

Recommend this place"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-10-07,5,"Super fun, cool, authentic hookah lounge, with fun Egyptian owners. If you want a hookah in New York, this is the place to be. Also really good music!!"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-10-06,5,"Wonderful environment, great music, and lively staff :) I come almost every week because it's always a good time! Would recommend to everyone."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-09-28,5,Great family Restaurant/Hookah lounge absolutely love the super friendly staff. I'm from Orange County California and will recommend this place to everyone. The owner went out of his way to accommodate us and even gave us some free baklava's and rice pudding which might I add was superb! I will definitely be coming back.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-09-28,5,Great outdoor area. Staff so nice-hookah!  Def recommend. Love everyone  from California great place to go with in nyc
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-09-21,4,Let me say we ordered 2 pictures of Fuck Me Up and yeaaaaa we definitely were in route to be messed up. The food was good but the drinks and hookah were great. Vibes were real chill and a little of a turn up.
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-09-15,2,"Really good hookah. Quoting my friends ""you can really feel the bubbles"". Now I don't have to go all the way to Inwood. The fries are really good too (my whole group devoured it) and the wings. I had a mojito with an interesting palette. Like a lychee taste. Definitely enjoyed it and recommend! 

The atmosphere is definitely more laid back. We go there to unwind after a night of partying.
*this was the first time I went*

The second time was a complete 180. We ordered hookah and no one tested it to see if it was working properly. The hose didn't work and it took forever to even call the waiter. It got to the point where we still hadn't touched it and the charcoal was half gone. The waiter was trying his best being friendly but I guess the staff in the back was slacking.  The outside area is definitely better than the sauna inside. And I saw a roach on top of everything . So... I look forward to searching for another hookah lounge in downtown manhattan until then this is not the spot."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-08-19,5,"Great place nice music good vibes. 
Nice and lively great watermelon hookah. Good for music good for a chill night out."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-08-13,5,this is the best hookah bar in NYC! amazing staff and super accommodating for all your needs! the waitstaff was super helpful with drinks and the hookah!
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-08-13,5,"What a fantastic place. Excellent vibe and fantastic service. I cannot recommend this place enough. For foodies, tourists, or the casual hookah bar-goer, this place is fantastic"
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-08-08,5,"Great hookah, snacks, and drinks. The Sahara mezze for one was surprisingly large (and tasty), and the vibes were on point.

Some hookah places try too hard. These guys try hard in all the ways that matter."
12,sahara-east-new-york-2,2018-08-05,5,"I would say I had a great time here, but I got too drunk and barfed. Luckily, the owner gave me a water and a cup of coffee for free. Nice guy!"
14,maman-new-york-10,2020-03-06,4,"What a cute lil spot! If you blink, you might miss it. So there's a cookie craze going on right now that led me to search for the closest Maman, and this location conveniently popped up in FiDi. After walking past it a couple of times, I realized it's a location-ish. 

It's a small shop, inside of a Paper Source. It's almost like a pop-up...or better yet, like a Panera Bread inside of a Borders (oh, the nostalgia). I think on a regular day, this tiny shop makes a lot of sense. It looks like a really quick way of getting a caffeine or sugar fix, especially for folks that work in FiDi and tourists. 

But this isn't a regular month. The Chobani/Maman cookie collaboration has gone viral which means...craziness. I don't think this tiny tiny shop was prepared for the viral sensation, nor is it really suited for such a thing. Regardless, the Maman (and Paper Source) staff were incredibly warm and really inventive in figuring out how to handle the order capacity. It was just two folks taking on this cookie task, and they did a great job in my opinion. 

But keep in mind, this place really is tiny -- I had to wait over an hour for my cookies. So get your double chocolate cookie fix with that in mind...and be nice to the Maman employees!"
15,milo-coffee-shop-new-york,2020-03-04,4,"Milo's perfect spot, 181 street & Amsterdam ave. Everyone coming from Washington Bridge our from the Bronx can see it from their cars and stop by it.  The Coffee shop is unique in the area. It has a trendy style and give costumers a warming welcome of a smile as you get in. Pastries & Coffee are simply fabulous. You'll need to try it!!"
16,swallow-cafe-brooklyn-4,2019-09-15,3,"Last time I was there, the menu was completely outdated and they still had items on there that they didn't sell anymore. They should really do something about that.

It's located inside the Dumbo Market, which is the coldest supermarket in existence. So come prepared.

There's a big seating area though."
17,le-glacier-manhattan,2018-02-12,3,"Not much to look at from the outside (or inside), Le Glacier is a place to get a decent albeit unspectacular smoothie or other frozen/cool treat. Prices are average for downtown Manhattan (i.e., would be expensive most other places). There is no seating in the restaurant but it is located in the atrium of a large office building (60 Wall Street) and there is ample seating in the atrium (although tables can be at a premium during lunch time). There's no reason to go out of your way to go to Le Glacier, but if you have the urge for a smoothie while you're in or at 60 Wall Street, go ahead."
17,le-glacier-manhattan,2015-05-13,1,"I stopped in to get a fresh fruit smoothie.  Ordered a large very berry (strawberry, blueberry, raspberry).  It was mostly water and ice.  They were very stingy with the fruit.  So it tasted like a watered down mess.  Cost $5.44 w/ tax.  You're better off stepping outside to one of the smoothie carts."
22,dunkin-new-york-162,2020-01-31,1,The man working the back with food ever since i have first went there always has a mouth full of blood looks like he has some kind of sickness and he always wipes his mouth with his hand. This place is disgusting and that's one way to spread diseases don't go here
22,dunkin-new-york-162,2019-05-08,3,This is 1 of the better dunkins. They aren't super friendly but they are quick. And the drinks like frozen coffee are usually made right.
24,blue-star-coffee-new-york,2018-07-03,5,"Great service, the pastries are always fresh and delicious, and the coffee is the absolute best! I look forward to going to Blue Star Coffee every morning on the way to work."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-07-10,5,Such a quaint spot with the cutest coffees & desserts and also a light lunch menu. Perfect spot to meet your friends. The owner is also really nice. Love to support local businesses like these! Try the avocado toast!
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-06-28,5,A stunningly beautiful coffee shop with delicious and unique artisan coffee.  The S'mores coffee was beautiful in its presentation.
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-06-12,5,"Let's face it, you're here for an instagram picture, and the s'mores latte really delivers on that front. It photographs well, it's presented with fanfare, and it's really tasty to boot.

I'm not a coffee snob (yet??), but even my friend who is really liked the espresso. She also said the flat white was too milky but they don't do cortados so she didn't know what else to order.

Just get the s'mores thing."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-03-05,5,"Cutest coffee shop ever! Felix is absolutely lovely; the interior reminds me of Europe. I have tried their cold brew and matcha - both are yummy! Don't forget to get the house nut milk (12/10 worth it). Besides, they have fountain sparkling water:)

It's a bit loud for getting work done but perfect for catching up with friends or even meeting for a casual interview. The is Wifi is pretty fast, and there are even some outlets (big win!!)."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-03-01,3,"I really wanted to love this place but the service or lack thereof made this a really disappointing visit. 

Obviously I love the decor, music and vibe. I couldn't imagine anyone walking away saying otherwise. It's a great place to Meetup with a friend and take your time catching up. 

Where it lost me was the service. There were only two ppl at the counter, which is clearly not enough. It took a very long time to get my order. They were out of teapots and clean mugs/glasses so everything was served in plain to go cups. The chai I ordered was nothing to write home about either. 

So, I'm willing to come back and give this place another try but I have to say I was very disappointed with my first visit"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-03-01,5,"You really don't need me to tell you how beautiful Felix Roasting Co is. From a block away, I could spot the restaurant, because even it's outdoor winter awning is customized. No detail is spared here, everything from the sugar to the garbage can is customized and beautiful to look at.

On top of it, the food and coffee were also really good. I tried the breakfast sandwich - which came on a very delicious, very soft brioche bun. (all the bread is from sullivan bakery, a lot of the pastries are from Supermoon Bakehouse). My friend ordered the ricotta toast with tomatoes and cucumbers and the mushroom bun. Highly recommend the ricotta toast. It was very delicious and came on a beautiful piece of tissue paper that matched the decor of the entire place.

Definitely worth checking out if you feel like going someplace that doesn't feel like you're in New York anymore. I wouldn't say it's super cozy, because when everything is that perfect, you feel more like you're in a museum or a TV set, but sometimes you want that vibe. If that's the case, there's no other coffee spot in NYC quite like this one."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-27,5,Holy pretty shop! And that matcha croissant was the best I've ever had. Now I know that wallpaper can seriously work wonders.
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-23,1,"Espresso didn't taste correct, tasted like citrus lemon. Asked what they could possible do to fix the latte and said they only carry one espresso in house. They knew the espresso wasn't good that day and still sold it?? Not helpful at all. Cute aesthetics though but not worth it."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-21,4,Really great americano but $$ for the size and while they advertise food they don't serve their roasts until 9am so I couldn't get breakfast.
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-20,4,"I love their interior... beautifully design space. Great place to come and have coffee and unwind. When it just opened my coworkers and I use to go there all
The time for our mid afternoon coffee break. It's clean, spacious and tasteful. For sure worth coming and seeing it. I am not in love with their actual coffee, but it's not bad by all means. I would say a must visit"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-18,5,"I found this place when I was searching for a new cafe to work on Yelp. I'm such a picky person when it comes to coffee shops. This definitely made my top 5 Café shops in the city especially when it comes to their interior design. Their service is also friendly especially Josh who made sure everyone is leaving happy. 

I definitely would recommend this beautifully decorated cafe to friends and family. Also - they roast their own coffee beans and have small apps! For those who don't drink coffee they also have wine and beer"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-18,5,"Talk about a midtown gem. The interior is amazing, and the drinks are just as fantastic as they look. 

I loved the s'mores latte - at $14.50, it's definitely the most I've ever paid for a coffee drink, but you pay for the presentation and preparation, and it's totally worth it. It's prepared more like a fancy cocktail (you truly get a show) minus the alcohol. 

Almond croissant (from Supermoon) was also fab, as was the cold brew. Finally, it's cool that they have different kinds of milk on tap. 

Due to the prices, I wouldn't consider this an everyday sort of place, but absolutely where you should go for a special caffeine treat."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-17,5,"One of a kind coffee shop with an opulent European feel. The interior design features multiple small tables and banquette seating with artworks and book shelves in the back. The shop is made up of three room spaces: front seating, cashier counter in the middle, and back seating. Coffee and baked goods are delicious and beautifully served."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-16,3,Pretty place but Overpriced  and coffee was just ok in my opinion. It definitely was not hot enough. Went there specifically for the S'mores latte ($10) and needed to drink it there because there wasn't a To-go option. Served in a small wine glass was pretty presentation but small and barely warm enough to be considered a hot beverage. Other members of my party had the hot chocolate and the mocha. They were less then impressed as well. 4 drinks and one slice of avocado toast  ran $42. I understand it's NYC and I don't mind paying the premium for quality. This just didn't do it for me. Pics are what is advertised vs what I received.
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-16,5,"I'm a sucker for a good coffee place and this is a great coffee place. Reasonably priced coffee, made with care and tons of tea selections as well. I'm usually a black coffee drinker and they have an excellent drip coffee. Love the decor and the chill vibe. Always happy to find a new coffee place around my neighborhood that's not a starbucks or a dunking donuts!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-13,4,"I've walked by this place SO many times and it looks so lovely, even from the outside. Today I trekked through the rain to spend some time working and sipping on coffee here. They have a great menu with a lot of creative food and drink items. I had a Cortado and a whipped ricotta, prosciutto, and fig toast. Both were amazing. There are a lot of tables and I had no problems finding somewhere to sit but I imagine it might have been harder earlier in the day. I want to give this place 5 stars for the space alone. However, as a coffee shop, it felt really hard to actually get work done due to the loud volume of other patrons. It seemed more people were here for work meetings or to catchup with friends than they were to work or grab coffee solo. Either way, I will definitely return in the future to try some more menu items!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-08,4,"As other reviews have said, the place is very beautiful. The girl who took my order and made my latte was very sweet, so I have no complaints about the service. Of course I had to try their famous s'mores latte-- it is by far the most expensive latte I've gotten in my life but it was pretty cool watching them make it. Tasted good too-- probably not 15-dollars-good but worth trying out once if you're into that kind of thing (which I am).  The cafe is also a lot noisier than I was expecting, which is a bit irritating because I was hoping to sit down with a book for a few hours. Music is kind of loud and the sound of people talking is louder. Would I return? Probably not.  Was it nice to go once just to check it out? Sure."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-02-08,5,"I've been here three times already and they have never disappointed! The staff is friendly, the decor is beautiful and the coffee is delightful! It's a must!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-01-31,5,"If you are a Wes Anderson fan like me, you will love this place. The decor is just so beautiful, the coffee is alright.  Not for serious coffee drinkers, my husband knows his coffee and was disappointed in their offerings. I'm a novice and my mocha was delish but what do I know? I wish I had gotten the hickory smoked s'mores latte but it didn't sound like something I'd enjoy and couldn't fathom spending $14 on a drink that didn't have a trace of alcohol in it. But I did see them make it for someone else and it truly is a work of art. But the place has such an incredible warmth, a Parisienne feel, an air of such decadence that despite the bad coffee, I'll be back. But this time I'll get the tea. If you haven't been here yet, do yourself a favor and drop in. It's worth it."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-01-28,5,"This was our first time in NY and we stopped by this coffee shop during the afternoon, it was cute and the coffee was great."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-01-26,5,"Have you ever dreamt of being in a Wes Anderson movie? This is how I imagine he would design a coffee shop. Few places in New York can distract you from the hustle and bustle always just outside the door. Felix has an incredibly thoughtful and beautiful design, and anyone who appreciates a delicious cup of coffee will enjoy spotting all of the meticulous details that tie this special spot together. The baristas are also very friendly, which is a plus!

Tips: Come with your laptop charged if you'd like to get a little work done. There are no outlets on purpose ;) 
Also, come hungry, because Felix is the only place that sells Supermoon Bakehouse croissants outside of the bakery itself. Yummm."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-01-22,5,"Wowwww! I luckily stumbled across this gem last night on my way to a meeting. Paris meets NY in this sophisticated cafe clearly designed for the upscale coffee aficionado! The ambiance is elegant and trendy, with a variety of delicious coffee concoctions and an array of decadent desserts to choose from. I ordered a skim latte to go- which had a delicious flavor. The s'mores latte is on my radar for my next visit- when I plan to stay  & enjoy my drink & the breathtaking ambiance. The barista was nice & helpful in the decision making process. The prices are consistent with cafes in the area. Highly recommend & plan to return!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-01-19,4,The prettiest cafe! Felt like I was in Europe. The Matcha Latte was not bad but tasted a little watered down. Their donuts were good! Seating took about 10 min but definitely want to bring my friends to this cute spot.
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-01-15,5,My daughter and I had toast and coffee (including the smoked s'more cup) Everything was great. Maybe a bit pricy for everyday but definitely worth it for a treat. The atmosphere was certainly a part of it: quite chic & instagram-able!
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-01-11,5,"Such a cute cafe, beautifully decorated. The drinks are a little on the pricey side, but people come here to hang out more than that morning cup of joe. And if you're here to hang out, the seating is so limited and the space is so open, that you do need to pay your dues to chill out there. I like that they have homemade almond milk. You can really taste the difference vs the watered down store bought almond milks. It also makes the lattes creamier, so you don't miss the benefits of steaming and foaming milk. I saw the more elaborate, IG worthy drinks, but they looked a bit too fancy and sweet for me to drink."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-01-07,5,"This place is so beautifully decorated and such a unique coffee experience. It's like high tea/tea rooms but for coffee. Definitely one of the most beautiful cafes I've been in.

Of course, with the lavishness, drinks can get pretty pricey. I got the Hickory Smoked S'mores Latte because it is their most famous drink. It was really cool seeing the drink made and smoked. It tasted really good but was definitely the most expensive latte I've ever paid for. My sister got the matcha latte and she really liked it too.

If you're looking for a more luxurious coffee experience, definitely come check out Felix!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-01-06,5,"Felix Roasting Co rivals the best coffee roasters in New York and the surrounding burrows. The roast profile is absolutely incredible. The atmosphere is confident and soothing. The Baristas, whether they have or haven't, can go toe to toe with your local throw down champs. 

I have not seen a more delicate and robust roast in ages. After working in the industry for a decade; I know you, just as I have, will truly appreciate the level of excellence in every cup. 

Please do yourself a favor and splurge on the S'mores Latte. It is well worth the price tag and it offers a great opportunity to say hi to the Barista crafting your drink. 

Don't forget to tip your Barista!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-01-05,2,"Brought my mom here to show her the beautiful atmosphere and decor and to have a cup of coffee together. We didn't have the best experience however. There is not enough seating at Felix for the demand and the amount of people that come in. We ended up waiting 30 minutes for a table.. which was a fight to the finish. There is enough space to add in more tables, and this way the shop won't have a groups of people standing around and waiting. When we finally got a table, another thing that negatively impacted our experience was that the baristas were not friendly at all. I inquired about the s'mores latte and the girl at the country barely said anything back. The baristas are supposed to make you feel welcome :( and I didn't get that feel here at Felix. I love the look of the place, but I don't know if that's enough for me to recommend it to a friend due to the other important aspects that are lacking."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2020-01-01,5,"Wow! So pretty! That's what I thought as soon as I walked in. I felt like I was in Paris! Even the bathroom was pretty! But I was here for coffee and that was just as delightful as the decor! The staff was friendly, the coffee was great, the food looked good! Ding ding ding it hit all points! I want to go back!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-12-28,2,"Got a cappuccino with house nut milk. For how beautiful the store is and the price of $5.72 plus tip, I was expecting it to be well made. It's a simple drink. What was served had the milk ratio of a latte and the temperature was significantly higher than it should have been for a cappuccino. It's what I would expect from a $3 latte from a deli. 

Definitely a beautiful store for Instagram pics but meh for the drink."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-12-27,5,"The S'more Latte is as good as people claimed, and more. If only photos could capture the smokiness of the marshmallow & the coffee! It is the perfect winter drink & beautifully presented. The Macha croissant is wonderful too. Joy for all your senses!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-12-27,5,"Delicious coffee, adorable decor.  The mocha was amazing, not sweet at all and so flavorful.  Will be back!  This place is a gem."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-12-26,4,"Very cute place and atmosphere, I didn't try much here but the black tea was weak. Definitely needs more strength."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-12-22,5,"Great coffee, the presentation is so pretty!!! 
And cafe is extremely pretty!!!! Very big and nite, great place!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-12-11,5,"apart from being beautiful and expertly styled, this place has house made nut milk on tap and a variety of inventive coffee drinks to choose from (the desserts/pastries and specialty drinks are not vegan, however--would be amazing if there could be this option!) 

note: there is wifi but no power outlets
bathroom is beautiful and clean just like the rest of the place"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-12-10,5,"Such sedulously prepared drinks.  It was like watching someone practice their religion.  Nice to see coffee treated as a craft.  Staff was also super friendly.

Good music, highly stylized space, nuanced & delicious..."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-12-01,5,"Beautiful cafe seemingly straight out of a Wes Anderson movie. Moreover, their aromatic coffee tonic blew me away. Spigots for different milks you may add to other brews are a nice touch. Supermoon bakes goods also make for a wonderful treat. This place couldn't be better."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-12-01,4,"Wonderfully inventive drinks & goodies.

Would have liked to try some of their coffee creations like the s'mores latte, but honestly couldn't bring myself to pay the price. In general, Felix is quite expensive, but I think part of the price is the vibrant vintage decor inside.

Felix resells Supermoon Bakehouse pastries, which are super delicious and still fresh!

Overall good vibes. Just wish I were in a stage of my life where I could pay $9 for coffee."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-11-30,5,"This cafe is truly a hidden gem in the neighborhood! It doesn't look like a chic cafe from outside on Park Ave South but once you walk in, it feels very exotic and classic. You can also get some nice drinks with pastries. It's a weird combination, I know, but it's simply delicious!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-11-20,2,"This is a really laid back place and it's very pretty inside. However, the plain coffee is absolutely terrible. It has the standard sour aftertaste of every crappy coffee. This review is only for the regular coffee and not any of the food or specialty coffee drinks like lattes or cappuccinos, which may taste much better. Also, if you enjoy weird aftertastes with your coffee, then this place is definitely for you!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-11-16,5,Visiting for the weekend but this was the best coffee I have ever had. The s'mores deconstructed latte was amazing. The atmosphere was great and the staff was helpful. Wish I had a place like this back home. Rarely leave reviews but this was needed.
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-11-14,4,"Beautiful space inside another ugly office building on Park Ave .
The  espresso was fine , not that great .
They have the fantastic pastries of supermoon downtown ....
Kind of eliminate the disappointment from the coffee."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-11-12,5,Okay...there is Felix Roasting Co. And then the rest. Best coffee spot that I have found in the city. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. The shop is beautiful. The coffee is amazing.
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-11-06,3,I went with a friend on my birthday (a Tuesday afternoon).  The place was packed and there wasn't any available seating with plenty of people on their laptops for hours.  We wanted to make sure we could get a seat before ordering anything.  Anyway we waited 20+ minutes and then decided to leave before wasting more time.
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-11-01,5,"My go to cafe spot when I want to take close friends or colleagues for a coffee date. Love the antique, vintage style interior with its whimsical wallpaper and picture frames--everything seems to slow down in this cozy spot--a delight on Park Ave. This place is new, has a lot of seating for a cafe in NYC, and the coffee is pretty good. They offer some avante guarde coffee drinks--like the smoked s'mores coffee and the espresso tonic (tonic has a hint of citrus and mint that you can later add espresso to or drink separately). I also like that they have free seltzer water you can draw from a tap. Love!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-10-28,3,"Hmmm, come for the gram worthy pics but the lattes and customer service are just alright. I ordered a hickory smoked s'mores latte and despite all the smoke and crowd worthy preparation, it fell short of yeah this was worth $14. To top it off, they closed an hour early, 5pm, when on yelp it said 6pm. I became even more turned off when the staff were handing out pastries but only mentioned it to what seemed like their friends at a corner table. Can we talk about preferential treatment?"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-10-15,1,"The most OBNOXIOUS and PRETENTIOUS spot in all NYC, perhaps the world. But what else do you expect!? This is the spot that serves an $18 S'mores espresso. Where people come in to take Insta pics of the nice wallpaper or good looking pastries without buying anything, just leaving after doing a 10 minute photoshoot. Avoid at all costs unless you want to end up in the background of an Asian girls photoshoot."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-10-14,5,"Great coffee, unique specialty drinks, super friendly!! 

They also have house made almond milk and various pastries that are good."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-10-03,5,"The most amazingly beautiful shop, brilliant menu items, and great atmosphere. Can't recommend enough."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-09-23,5,"Excellent, small, strong espresso drinks. Limited choice of pastries. Nice setting. Would return."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-09-20,5,"No surprise that the ham and cheese croissant from this gorgeous cafe is probably the best I've had in New York - Supermoon Bakehouse sells their baked goods here! Unlike other ham and cheese croissants, these have it as a filling rather than sandwiched between a croissant cut in half. These remind me of Tartine's ham and cheese croissants, but unlike Tartine's, these can't be warmed up. The cheese is stiff and the ham is slightly tough, but I'd still order it again.

If you're looking for a good jam or jelly donut, get the strawberry brioche donut here. The donut itself is wonderfully fluffy and soft, and the jam is just runny enough. No needs in the jam (that I saw), which makes the jam really smooth and delightful. Though a bit on the petite side, the donut was well worth it's price in quality."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-09-12,5,Decided to go here after my morning run while visiting the city! I did not bring my card with me and it was a cashless cafe but the kind barista gave it to me on the house! I got a regular iced latte and really enjoyed it. Every corner inside the cafe is so pretty and the baristas were very nice. Can't wait to go back and try the s'mores drink!
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-09-04,5,"Great place! I really enjoyed this place, it was not packed and the coffee was amazing. The place is pretty inside and is in a prime location on Park Ave. I recommend everyone to check this place out and indulge in their coffee."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-09-03,5,"Came here only to try the Hickory Smoked S'mores Latte. Expensive but worth it for possibly my only time in NYC. Yolo! It was delicious, tasted just like its name, and gave me the perfect dose of caffeine. The shop is cute too."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-08-31,5,"So let me start this review out with I had done extensive research before stopping in at Felix. I wanted to try a different coffee place every day for the 2 weeks I was in NYC on business and it was so good I actually returned a second time for more coffee. 

For trip #1 I HAD to have the hickory smoked s'mores latte. That is and will probably be the most expensive coffee I ever buy in my whole entire life but I'd do it again in a heartbeat. It tastes just like you're out camping in the woods. 

I returned yesterday for round two and was disappointed they'd stopped making the Lavender honey latte that they'd had as a special for summer so I had to settle for a mocha latte instead. Bummer.

All in all the employees are very nice, it's the cleanest, nicest coffee shop I've ever been in, and next time I'm back in town I'll have to try the next season's coffee special."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-08-27,4,"This place is probably the fanciest coffee spot I've been to, and I've been to a lot! Very classy inside. I've been wanting to try the smores latte for quite some time now and I finally bit the bullet.

The smores latte was very delicious but for $15 it's quite small! It's fun to see them light the latte marshmallow on fire and see it smoke for a bit, It's definitely an experience but if you are not completely amused by that I probably wouldn't go for the Smore's and I would go for a different drink alternative. Overall the ambience was nice and the service was friendly."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-08-25,5,"Deconstructed ESPRESSO TONIC is a must try. It has the unique taste which I really loved it. Also the s'more latte is an instagram worthy,trust me :)"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-08-24,3,"The ambience is 5/5, European classical vibe and a great spot to hang out with friends
The matcha tho, tried both the over iced and the hot creamy matcha. 1/5 - tbh, the worst matcha that I've tasted in my life. I could barely taste the matcha...
Charged for $6 for a croissant too
Overall. I would've come back if the drink was good but with the price you're paying and the qualities you get...definitely not worth it"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-08-21,5,"In NYC, a city that practically lives on IV infusions of caffeine to sustain itself, Felix Roasting Co offers a unique experience for those looking for their ""fix""

This establishment is located in a busy part of the city (31st and Park), but surprisingly as evident by experience and other reviews it's not impossible to get a table to sit down and get some work done. Free WiFi also 

The place is super unique. Like another reviewer mentioned real old school Parisian feel to it. Vibrant pastel cools, art, comfortable seating throughout. 

As for the coffee, well had to try both signature drinks. The deconstructed tonic espresso and the s'mores latte. You're going to pay for these drinks of course because it's NYC and this is a novelty ($10 and $14 respectively). The deconstructed tonic espresso was very unique. To think tonic, mint, and espresso would taste refreshing and full bodied. But the winner (if your gunna choose one is the s'mores latte. Presentation and preparation is a 10/10. How they smoke it, and use a flamethrower to roast the marshmallow. Amazing. Excellent espresso, not overly sweet or chocolatey. Not enough can be said of this coffee. 

If you're not a coffee drinker go fo the gram. Go to relax. Get some work done. Bring a date. All the above you'll be super satisfied. Well done Felix Roasting Co."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-08-18,5,"Best coffee in NYC. 
Fantastic staff, good quality coffee, immaculate decor and atmosphere, clean and a must see for tourist and locals alike!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-08-10,1,"So, I tried this place earlier today. I ordered a cold brew, added some simple syrup and a splash of whole milk. I have food poisoning now. My guess is the milk was bad. I am super nauseous. That aside, it's the worst tasting cold brew I've ever had. The after taste is adjacent to what charcoal smells like."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-08-08,5,Best coffee in the city! Very cute decorations attracting passerbys to walk in. Two seats outside to chill and watch the crowds on Park Ave. check it out!
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-08-05,3,"It is good coffee and good baked goods. There is a good deal of caffeine in a 12oz regular coffee and can keep you going for hours, rate this as perfect 5STAR high caffeine boost ! 

I found the croissant to be tasty and correct inside but much too crispy outside for me.  Now two hours later I have a lot of oil/butter coming out of the pores of my face, so too much butter used to get that crispy exterior and therefore way too high calories for what it is. 2STARS.

There was also at 3PM a lot of people sitting and taking up space, with laptops open but not really working, kind of very low energy. There was even someone who had fallen asleep. All well dressed folks, but low low energy. Maybe there was one available place to sit. Please add seating. It is a much smaller place than it seems in the photos. I choose to sit outside on the bench. 3STARS for ambiance and energy and lack of seating.

But I am nearby so I will be back for the coffee often (to go)."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-08-04,5,"One of the cutest coffee shops I've gone to.

 It looks like an old Parisian cafe with great decor. Beautiful art on the walls, cute tables and comfortable things to sit on. It has a front area and a back area. These both look a bit different so depends on your style. 

I was surprised that this place wasn't packed. It was easy to find a table. It was pretty nice to study in. 

It looks like they serve both coffee and wine. 

The downsides are the price of the coffee creations, and the lack of outlets. I think I spotted one towards the front. 

I haven't tried it but someone ordered a smores drink and the way they made it was pretty awesome, it involved some fire and smoke. It was super cute, but I'm sure expensive. 

I would come back to study here, especially if I'm using books. But if you have to use a laptop I would say charge it before coming."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-07-26,5,"Edit: It was my birthday a while back so I got their honeycomb latte. It was unique. I found the flowers a bit off-putting/had to remove them. The other parts of it was delicious but I wouldn't get it again. Unique.

Very nice staff in a pretty place make this a local retreat from the area. You'd expect a place like this in Soho or the East Village but I'm happy to pass by and stop in primarily for a tea or their shrubs. The staff here is helpful and the music at least in the early morning is light, mostly indie folk. They serve pastries from Super Moon which is a refreshing change.

I'd give a extra point for their milk selection. Their homemade nut milk made with pepitas (similar to a pumpkin seed) and other ingredient is delicious with a nice lightly sweet aftertaste. While I am not someone who prefers almond milk drink, it's on tap and free which is a nice change from other places which can charge around 50¢ to a $1.00 more. Their lattes and other drinks have a nice extra flavor thanks to this.

I usually get their cold brew nitro tea which is 5$ and completely worth it for a price. They use a fancy oolong here (iron goddess) and it's nice and strong but not so bitter. They also like most other coffee places have matcha but theirs is different as they use a brand from Fukuoka instead of the usual Uji like most places. Their latte is frankly better mostly due to their unique nut milk. Their normal matcha drinks are slightly lacking, being not stirred enough usually so there is a bit of grain.

They have a rotating selection (by season) of shrubs which are fruit infused sparkling drinks. They range from a bit overdone (their cider one which was overpowered/too spicy from the vinegar/pepper) to good (their passion fruit one which isn't being made for a while still) to one good enough I'd want to drink every day (their blood orange one.) If you are unsure if you'll like it, they'll give a small sample which is always appreciated.

Overall, this place is excellent. The prices are high but you get what you pay for in spades (usually.) Mid 4."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-07-19,3,"The coffee itself is lovely and so is the decor of the place. What's terrible is the service. Had a blonde lady, 3pm on a Thursday. Rude AF, didn't want to explain the pastry's and just plain annoyed. Look, if you don't want the job then go home. Don't make it miserable for the customers. Won't be coming back for awhile. Plenty of other  instagram-able coffee shops around."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-07-18,4,"Love their interior vibe

Nice guy who is from North Carolina

Their coffee is $$ so wouldn't go often but once in a while treat yourself



Their coffee drinks making process is dope! And their concept  is cool.
Some space for single or double sitting! 
In the flat iron area!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-07-17,5,"This is really the unique cafe. The interior and the master-crafted lattes are worth the visit when in NYC. Come here for the interior decors, drinks, and overall vibes."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-07-14,5,"Aesthetic. That is all. Nah but really this place is just so lovely to look at. From the decor to the cups it's all so appealing and in the words of M. Kondo it sparks joy for me. I could see myself sitting here sipping cup after cup of coffee just staring at the walls. Any who I stopped in after someone recommended it. I ordered an americano very good coffee. Their dairy, non dairy and water are self serve and super cute. Very very aesthetically pleasing!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-07-12,5,"This cafe is so beautiful. We easily found a nice seat on a Friday morning. The baristas were friendly. Also surprised it was average NYC price for coffee, considering the aesthetics. Bathroom also very nice and clean."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-07-07,4,What a beautiful coffee shop in Park ave. Interior is stunning and the drinks are as well. I came here to try the hickory smoked s'mores latte and ok... let me just say I don't think I have ever spent $16 on a cup of latte. That is high key ridiculous but damn that latte was effin good. Due to the high price point I felt like I needed to take home the twig as a souvenir. Will I spent $16 on this drink again? Probably not. Was it worth it? Ehhhh but it was pretty and tasty and you got yourself a twig to place on your shelf so I guess it isn't TOO bad. I would still come back to this place though because they have other drinks that looked amazing as well.
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-07-07,3,"The atmosphere was nothing more than instagram able, otherwise it felt unnecessary and over the top as a whole. The latte had an odd cardboard flavor. The espresso was silky smooth and delicious but was covered by too much milk. For the price I payed I did not get my money's worth."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-07-07,5,"Some days you want coffee and some days you want an experience. FRCo is an experience.
The vibes are enticing enough as every corner is stunning. But the display of the pasties and the coffee bar is truly the center of attention. 
The specialty drinks are essentially the draw to this establishment. The deconstructed espresso tonic is delicious and refreshing. It smells so good that we wished it came as a candle or fragrance. The honeycomb latte is so pretty and fulfills our dessert cravings. The matcha latte, looking plain in comparison, was smooth and exactly what I hoped for. I definitely recommend this place for dates or catching up with friends."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-07-05,5,"Phenomenal. Delicious, beautiful and magically presented. The hickory smoked s'mores latte is of course the crowds pleasing winner, but the regular coffee is just as good and as lovingly prepared. And the shrubs are amazing and refreshing."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-07-01,4,"Great coffee at a reasonable price! The inside is SUPER cute and perfect for a cute instagram if you're anything like me. It is a bit packed during peak hours (expected), but worth it for the cafe vibes, interior, and coffee."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-06-29,3,"Wow. What a beautiful interior. I LOVE places with gorgeous and unique design, and Felix Roasting Co. does it so well. It's definitely not a generic coffee shop, but the name leads one to believe that they focus solely on coffee. During my time here, many people came in to order their specialty cocktails instead. 

As a true Yelper, I looked through Felix's pictures and came across this beautiful drink: Hickory Smoked S'mores Latte. It's a really unique drink, and the barista invited me to watch her make it. They begin with an cooled wine glass that has dark chocolate and graham cracker crumbs on the outside and pour slightly sweetened espresso with molasses into the glass. Then, the barista heats up milk and cream and decorates the coffee with latte art. She pulled out the wooden stick with their house-made caramelized marshmallow, and what happens next I can't even explain. She smoked up the glass inside a glass chamber and torched the marshmallow. You honestly just have to come and witness it. It's a pretty cool experience. The unique drink and barista experience comes at high price: $15. I get it, though. It's what I would expect in NYC. 

The latte was just okay. Nothing special. I know it's not a classic coffee shop, but I expected them to at least have outlets to charge my laptop. I had to leave pretty quickly because my laptop was on low battery. I guess people just come in, drink, and leave, so it's not a good study/work place. I would come just to look at the beautiful interior."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-06-27,5,A beautifully designed and decorated coffeehouse with excellent coffee in NYC. Iced drinks made with bartender-style mixers and artfully crafted coffee. I've been to many coffee spots around and this is one of the best.
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-06-23,5,"This coffee shop doesn't look like your ordinary Starbucks, the atmosphere and ambience is so beautiful, it looks like an art gallery to me. And you have to get Dulce de leche donut!! It's amazing!! I bet all other pastries are as good, but this donut blew my mind. Coffee menu is quite extensive, they have some fancy coffee drinks you won't find anywhere else."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-06-21,3,"The decor here is very beautiful; it's pink and girly with large paintings on the wall and comfy seats. They have sparkling water on tap, which was actually pretty good and the atmosphere is really nice. 

The coffee on the other hand, not so much. I've been here twice so far and ordered americanos both times(hot and then cold) and I just couldn't bring myself to finish it even though the portion was small. It has an overly sour kind of taste and is very abrasive. 

This might be due to personal preference but just a heads up if you're not really into that sort of thing."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-06-19,4,"The decor is beautiful in general although there was an absolutely huge bouquet of DEAD flowers. Not just wilted but crispy dead which is weird in such an elegant place! It just sends the wrong message. Is the place not doing well? I think they have lowered their prices which is good and the coffee was delicious. Well made, strong, and flavorful !! 4 stars for the coffee!!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-05-29,5,"I found this cute little spot around my job, the cute pink floral couches stood out to me. I was craving a matcha tea, so why not. My best friend and I weren't so sure what to get so she got a hot matcha latte and I got a chai. I tried both, the chai had an acquired taste but I loved more the matcha and I ended up taking hers. The employees were really nice and the place was very instragamble. Great spot to take your pictures and enjoy your coffee and also if you need a quiet spot to do some work."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-05-28,4,"Exotic coffee shop that offers $15 espresso and $12 coffee with tonic water. Love the decor here, pretty unique. It has a couple of tables in the front of the store and a round bar that looks like a dome where you can order and then more tables in the back. I like the tiles on the walls that make the shop look a little greek-like. It looks antique. The shop is long and narrow but because of the round bar in the middle of the store, they lack seats.

I've tried latte and it was a bit blend for me. But most people come here for the espresso show anyway. They fire the marshmallow cube on top of the espresso and it's served with a cinnamon stick. The marshmallow is pretty sweet of course and the espresso is pretty thick and creamy I really liked it. But I can't see people getting this $15 espresso every time. Most peeps probably get it once for the fire show like me.

Staff here are awesome and really down to earth. They explain things with patience."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-05-27,5,"Seriously the most GORGEOUS coffee shop ever! The attention to detail is so impressive, not to mention the coffee is actually good and strong! Not overpriced either. Had a lovely afternoon coffee meeting with a friend. Will def return because they offer wine too!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-05-24,5,"If you're a coffee snob like me you'd love this place! They have milk on tap and the atmosphere is very English hotel lobby vibes -- you'll find lots of students instagramming everywhere. I got the s'mores latte and it was $14 definitely a one time type of order. It was an interesting drink and wasn't as sweet as I thought I'd be but the price was a bit hefty. I'd stick to the normal coffees next time I visit!

This is a great place to take your friends to chit chat after a meal. I was there midday on a weekday and it wasn't that packed at all but I can definitely see it get packed on weekends. I'll be coming back soon!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-05-20,5,"Attention instagrammers- you have to check this place out. I was lucky enough to come here when it first opened and there wasnt a crowd. Since then, it's been packed every time I stop by, daytime and evening. If you come on a weekend, you'll probably have to wait a while for a table. The specialty drinks are pricey but they're surprisingly complex and worth getting at least once. So about those drinks:
Flat white- pretty solid, strong yet smooth
Bonus points for their house blend nut milk!
S'mores drink- fun to watch them make it, cute drink, and a depth of flavor I didn't expect. I thought it would be sweet but it was actually bitter and the smoke really came through.
Espresso Tonic - so different and the drink I recommend if you only come once. You're supposed to try it as is and then add the espresso shot and see how the flavor changes. This is such a complex drink with layers- a little sweet, a bit bitter, minty, with a hint of citrus."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-05-10,1,"Simply overpriced and not professional. We ordered coffee and iced tea. It turned up that tea had cinnamon. I am allergic to cinnamon. I let her know and she took tea back saying that she will make smth else. But she never did. 
Well, I never beg people and ask twice, especially in places where latte costs $15.
Such a shame"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-05-04,5,"this place is magical. It is absolutely STUNNING! I can't believe it used to be a nail salon before it was this gem of a coffee shop. Instagrammers and bloggers rejoice, there are a million photo opportunities in this place. But its beauty goes beyond the decor, the coffee is on point. In a place that puts on a whole smoke show for a smore latte might have you doubt their ability to serve the basics well, but i don't think there is a single item on their menu I wouldn't recommend. Great addition to the coffee scene!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-05-03,4,"Really cool atmosphere and great coffee, tea and pastries. The s'mores drink seems to draw the crowd with the marshmallow roasting and firewood smoking show that accompanies the chocolatey drink."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-04-26,5,"A gem of a cafe! Inside is beautiful -- pink everywhere and flowers on all the tables. Lattes -- pretty expensive.

Got a s'mores latte after seeing it on Yelp. $12 is steep for a latte but it was fun to watch them make it -- they toast the marshmellow with a torch and use smoke to give the latte a smoky finish. 

Table seating is somewhat limited -- some people were definitely working on their laptops but a good amount of people were there to chat with friends as well. I'd probably feel guilty if I were to sit at a table for too long working. 

Would definitely come back to try the other drinks on the menu."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-04-23,5,"One of the rare times that I wish Yelp would allow more than 5 stars. Look, the coffee reminds me of Stumptown and the baked goods may not be as extraordinary as Balthasar but the experience is otherworldly."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-04-23,4,"This place is super cute and a nice place to catch up with friends. Despite the fact that interior looks fancy, the teas and coffees are reasonably priced, unless of course you order something like the s'mores latte. The chai I ordered was really nice and pleasant to drink. My only gripe with this cafe is that the seating is so limited and the tables are tiny. There is a lot of space in this tea room and the owners should really add more seating and tables."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-04-16,5,"So beautiful and PEACEFUL walking in to the open airy cafe. Cute paintings and colors on the walls. Not crowded at any point. More seating in the back.

We ordered:
Iced chai - A-
Smoked s'mores latte - A (you get a cool ""show"" when they smoke the drink and torch the marshmallow at the bar)
Matcha croissant - A

There's also free tap/sparkling water you can serve yourself, which I appreciated. And homemade nut milk, which was interesting to try!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-04-09,5,"""Most girly coffee shop in NYC""

Came here for a biz meeting, but this is such an ornate place.....it's looks a bandit from Versailles attended a musical from Liberace..except more pink

Haves
1) The most beautiful coffee shop in nyc
2) The most chick friendly coffee shop anywhere 

Wishes
1) more seating 
2) faster service"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-04-04,4,"It's a fancy cafe that does not take cash. I paid 6 bucks for the ice matcha latte, it's more on the expensive side. Wish the matcha taste was a bit stronger, too creamy for my taste but will go back and try their coffee."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-04-01,5,"Smore's latte, espresso, matcha croissant, salted caramel donut  all very good! 
Friendly staffs! 
Especially s'mores latte was so good and it was fun to watch them making it :) 
Love the interior, clean, lots of paintings. Great ambience as well."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-03-30,4,"I found this place on Yelp's Hot and New Cafes! Oh buddy, am I glad that I stumbled into this gem. 

Felix Roasting Co is the definition of a high end and sophisticated coffee shop. The interior design felt like I was ordering coffee in a royal palace. There are plenty of seatings, but there are also a lot of people. I came here during the afternoon and the place was filled with people working, reading and socializing. There might be a wait to get a table after you order your coffee (it's worth the wait). 

I ordered the Hickory Smoked S'mores Latte. At first I was a bit hesitant as I never paid $18 for a small glass of Latte, but..... it was worth a one time experience. The barista will make this drink in front of you, very IG worthy. The taste of the latte definitely made it feel like I was waking up in the forest with the natural smell of forest wood. I slowly sipped on the latte while eating the marshmallow on a real branch. This was by far one of the more creative coffee drinks I have consumed. 

I would come back to Felix again to try their other coffee, but the price for the Hickory might be too steep for me. One time experience!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-03-26,5,"My latte with nut milk was excellent, and the shop was fantastically clean and roomy and well-decorated."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-03-19,5,"I absolutely love Felix Roasting Co. 

Aesthetically this café is perfection, something out a Marie Antoinette fever dream!

Experientially, the staff is pleasant and always happy to answer questions. The coffee is smooth and consistently topped with expert latte art, which lends a sophisticated and professional air to their operations.

You are able to enjoy coffee/tea/croissants (from SuperMoon Bakehouse) during the day, but then easily transition to a happy hour mindset as they begin serving wine in the afternoon.  

Overall, what you will get at Felix is smooth coffee, visually enticing pastries, and a consistently lovely customer experience. Bravissimo!"
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-03-14,5,"Since September 2018 Felix has been creating a buzz not only with the caffeine they serve but the aesthetically pleasing decor that includes blush and teal walls, rose gold accents, and a round wooden coffee bar.  The creators of this java oasis were not setting out to make THE most Instagammable coffee-shop in The Big Apple but rather a beautiful space for patrons to have a unique experience.

Felix is becoming known for their creative coffee creations but also the only other place you can grab Supermoon Bakehouse pastries in the city.  During my visit I ordered the hickory smoked s'mores latte which comes with a price tag of $14 and not jolt of caffeine as well.  The drink is made using their house Ethiopian coffee, and prepared inside of a graham cracker dusted rim glass and then smoked inside of a large glass bell.  If you are not in the mood for one of the coffee creations they do offer the traditional coffee beverages with a more modest price.  They offer wifi at this location but no electrical outlet, so you won't be camping out at Felix.  

I highly recommend you visit this fab place to grab a cup of coffee and really just take in the location."
27,felix-roasting-co-new-york-3,2019-03-13,5,"So beautiful and so worth spending time in. I couldn't believe this place was right on Park - it seems much more Greenwich Village-y. Of course it's must appreciated for those of us who are stuck in midtown for work - a nice reprieve from the ugly!

Two drip coffees and a croissant came to $10 so prices are totally normal. Nowadays pastries run for about $4-5 and coffee at a spot like this is $2.50. Reasonable in my opinion especially given the beautiful design of this place. Also, they have different creamers on tap and don't charge extra if you opt for almond milk (or their very own nut milk). 

I noticed they serve wine as well so looks like you can go with whatever you are in the mood for at Felix.

Ps- I kept the pretty paper they serve their pastries on. It was too gorgeous to just toss away!"
28,lamano-new-york,2020-04-22,5,"Let me paint the picture. We were just leaving Kleinfeld's Bridal, aka the filming site of my favorite guilty pleasure show, Say Yes to the Dress. I hadn't thought we'd get to go inside, but they let us go in and take a peek around. It was SURREAL. I was already soooooo happy when we wandered outside, feeling quite hungry. We started walking down the cute street and looked up and saw the cozy, lit up Lamano exterior. 

We don't have any authentic Spanish tapa spots back at home, so I was overjoyed when we found a spot with fresh jamon, Mahou beer and croquettas. It brought me back to my days living in Spain and truly made it the most magical evening ever. 

Our server was super sweet and spoke both Spanish and English. We ordered a few tapas to share: plato de jamon, croquettas and pan. The croquettas had jamon in them as well and were incredibly delicious and hot. 

This place is small, dimly lit and creative feeling. It was truly a pocket of escape from the cold, busy streets and transported me to a different place. I could've stayed here all day and this is truly my favorite spot we ate at in NYC. I so wish I could take this cute spot home with me!"
28,lamano-new-york,2020-03-01,3,"25-minute wait for one octopus tapas.  It was served inconsistent than the previous visit from only a few weeks prior.  Instead of crisped legs under a light drizzle, only a few pieces were served drenched in thick white gravy.  Despite being asked multiple times to continue to wait (which we did politely) and we had to order two extra glasses of wine/ordered extra hummus tapas--all just to fill an empty table for almost a half hour--nothing was comp'd on the bill. Friend works across the street and we frequent 9-10th Ave. Will not return."
28,lamano-new-york,2020-02-22,5,"This place is a gem! Delicious food, excellent service and a great wine selection! Highly recommend!"
28,lamano-new-york,2020-02-17,4,"A bit on the smaller side - if you're planning to have dinner with a big group of people, I wouldn't unless you have a reservation. Even with a reservation, they have an 1.5 hour time limit. This is a great place for traditional styled Spanish tapas - very comparison to the dishes in Spain. We ordered the potato tortilla, sardines, gambas and octopus. The list of options were scarcer than most other restaurants. This place does offer happy hour deals however, we came here on Valentines Day and the offer wasn't available. If you ever come on a holiday, call in advanced and doublecheck!"
28,lamano-new-york,2020-02-17,5,"Lamano Chelsea deserves more stars. I am blown away by the exceptional customer service, delicious food and intimate restaurant design. 

I held an event here and everyone with the company went above and beyond to make sure it was impeccable. Kristian, Charlie (our host/server for the evening) and the staff were phenomenal, extremely communicative and very easy throughout the event. I applaud them! The food was delicious, well-timed and fed our group perfectly. The croquettes and seafood paella were the top for me. The wines and selection of alcohol was more than adequate. 

It's safe to say with the amount of thank you texts and compliments of the restaurant that I received, that our entire party had a great time and will be back! Los Cintron, our band, was equally thrilled with the restaurant and happy to make the celebration extra special. 

I could not have dreamt of a better experience. 

Go here."
28,lamano-new-york,2020-02-11,5,"A small quaint tapas spot with great staff and tasty food. I came with my one year old to catch up with friends, and although they had no high-chairs for kids, the waitress ran to the restaurant next door and borrowed one. The gambas (shrimp) was in a tasty broth, which was perfect for dippping bread, the croquetas we're tasty and crisp, and sangria was not too sweet and refreshing."
28,lamano-new-york,2020-02-02,5,"This is a cozy and intimate space with a great atmosphere for small groups or pairs. All of the seats are bar-height, which lends to the casual feel. They have a great selection of Italian wines and small plates - I enjoyed the chardonnay and the organic white wine I got - both were served at a nice chilly temperature in large glasses that lent for better whiffing.

I tried the artichoke and cauliflower - really nice mix of textures with roasted vegetables and tender artichoke, with a creamy aioli-type sauce and a roasted red pepper sauce.

The short rib pita pizza was really delicious - generous amounts of stretchy warm cheese, crisp bread, and fork-tender braised meat.

Last dish I had was the octopus - it could be a little more crisp, but it was tender and flavorful and no complaints there."
28,lamano-new-york,2020-02-01,5,"Went to La mano for the first time on tuesday. Ordered a variety of plates and they were all delicious, kudos for the chef and also the awesome service that our waitress Angelica provided, very knowledgable of the drinks and the menu and always making sure if we needed something!"
28,lamano-new-york,2020-01-11,5,"Very rarely give reviews but felt this was worth it. The atmosphere was great with a very friendly staff. The food was as advertised and delicious, with the staff continuously checking if we needed refills and provided great info on all the foods. Everything was delicious and couldn't recommend more. 

Only thing I'd say is you likely don't need to order any dishes if you plan on going for the endless spread"
28,lamano-new-york,2019-12-31,2,"The lowish rating is due to the restaurant's fruitfly/gnat issue. I visited this place a couple of years ago (or was it last year?) and noticed the problem with the fruitflies. I was a bit suprised that management still has not corrected the problem. Perhaps, it's not a priority for management. 

Fruitfly problem aside, Lamano has nice selection of wine and champagne. Since we were coming from brunch, we decided to order a bottle of champagne in lieu of ordering food. The bottle prices were pretty reasonable for the area, and I cannot really complain about that. Our bartender was pretty cool, and he apologized for the fruitflies. The restaurant is kind of small so it's best to visit with a couple of people rather than a large group."
28,lamano-new-york,2019-12-30,5,"This tiny restaurant really impresses! As a vegetarian, I was a little dubious that I would find enough to eat at a tapas restaurant, but their beet hummus was to die for and so many of the other dishes were veggie leaning and tasty. Great staff and really cozy environment."
28,lamano-new-york,2019-12-21,1,"What a waste of money and time. Overly thick, leathery serrano ham and undercooked, oversauced patatas bravas.   The people cooking have been trained to go through the motions but clearly have no interest in their product or their customers."
28,lamano-new-york,2019-11-13,4,"How had I not been to Lamano yet?! I am in the 'hood, and l love a tiny tapas joint. My friend and I went before a movie, so hit the happy hour dishes/pricing (we didn't feel the portions were too small for the cost at least for HH.) And the wine was decent. (I dinged a star because I'm a prof'l Wineau and I thought the wine options were good but not great; they were out of the Godello that night and didn't have a suitable replacement, and the staff might not have been super knowledgable/on their wine game...) BUT(!) the staff was very helpful bringing a few tastes so my friend and I could pick something we really wanted to drink, which I know is a pain when they're busy, so I truly appreciated that service. I thought the creative takes on ""traditional"" tapas dishes was fun (never had patatas bravas served like that, nor the mini tortilla espanola,) and I loved the sesame-infused beet hummus! Perhaps I, too, would be miffed about the portion/$ ratio if I went outside of HH, but I found Lamano charming and delish and a decent value on my visit."
28,lamano-new-york,2019-10-22,1,"Yeah, no, sorry. This place is a joke.

Like someone else very recently said, the portions are extremely small, even by Manhattan standards. If it wasn't for pure desperation to get some food in our bellies before a birthday outing, I would never have gone here. 

First of all, the place is tiny and cramped and not in a cute way. We didn't have reservations so we were almost begrudgingly given a corner of a table for six, of which one chair was basically directly in front of the entrance door because they had the door propped open. 

The food and drinks are way overpriced for what you receive. This wasn't necessarily shocking at first. However, thank goodness we only ordered two tapas to start, because that was the end. The jamon croquetas were super small and essentially all cheese. And don't get me started on the pan con tomate with manchego (that cost us an extra $3, mind you). It tasted like a sad excuse for bruschetta with shredded mozzarella cheese on top. I would have had a better meal getting a frozen pizza from the bodega on the corner. No, I am not exaggerating.  

Sangria was watered down but with food like what we got, this was the least of my concerns. Furthermore, the host/waiter sat a group of three women at our table shortly after we arrived, so all privacy and comfort went out the window.  

Skip this place!"
28,lamano-new-york,2019-10-18,2,"Lamano would be a good spot if the portions weren't so comically small for the price. 

The food and drinks are good quality but tiny and overpriced, even for a tapas spot in Manhattan... Unfortunate to say, but I won't be back."
28,lamano-new-york,2019-10-16,4,"My companion and I were looking to get out of a panel after a movie screening at the nearby SVA theater. We looked at the map to see what was available in the area and Lamano was one of the options. I'm not sure why we chose it in the end but it may have been simply because we were already walking in its direction. I'm glad we did!  

The place was small but in every facet packed a punch. Whomever designed the interior knew what they were doing. There is well placed mirror that makes the place look twice as big. It's a really good design trick! Because of the size of the place the tables (all High Tops) are close together. So be forewarned that you might get a little closer than usual to  your fellow diners. In fact, you may have to share tables. 

The kitchen is tiny and pretty much in full view. Remarkably, that small kitchen puts out some pretty awesome dishes. It makes sense that their menu is filled with a lot of tapas options. We ordered several dishes. I liked all but one (a cold bread based dish that I can't recall at the moment). Other than that, my only other dislike was the Strawberry Cider. I think next time I'll stick with the regular cider but don't take my word for it. Try it yourself!

Bottom line: You should definitely visit! Just be ready for cozy quarters and avoid the cold tapas dishes. You'll love it!"
28,lamano-new-york,2019-10-08,4,"Super cute little space with a tiny kitchen pumping out some pretty solid classic dishes.  All high tables inside, forced communal if your party isn't large enough to fill the whole table, which can be fun if you're open. 
One complaint is no hooks under the table, so we all ended up draping jackets and purses over our laps and/or awkwardly stacking things on the table.  Great music and cozy vibe.  

Drink-wise, small but nice selection of mostly Spanish wines and a few beers.  For food, we tried:
- chorizo fundido (can't go wrong with a big skillet of melted cheese, though could have used more bread here)
- cold mushrooms - unexpectedly were really spicy (not advertised, beware)
- patatas bravas - can (usually) never go wrong.. this variety had really small cubes which were fun
- griddled manchego with rosemary - really nice"
28,lamano-new-york,2019-09-25,5,"Popped in for a quick bite before catching a flight at JFK... we lucked out with happy hour specials so we sampled a few different items.

The interior is cute - tall tables only, funky little bathroom... the kitchen is the bar! Pretty cool what they put out from such a tiny space

We tried and loved the ham plate, tortilla, Patatas bravas

The Pan con tomate was good by it not great

The ensalada with beets was so yummy we each got one!

The cava sangria - delightful!

Great deals if you go between 4-6:30pm"
28,lamano-new-york,2019-08-21,5,Genius food and genius preparation for such a small place. Happy hour is a great deal!!
28,lamano-new-york,2019-08-11,3,"Cute little Spanish place. I visited on Sunday evening was very quiet and we decided to get a table outside. The menu is short but with variety of options. We got the octopus, pan con tomate, zetas, patatas bravas, gambas al ajillo and tortilla. Portion are good to share with somebody else but sadly the ingredients didn't feel fresh;  a lot of the stuff had the prep - made& reheated flavor, except for the gambas and pan con tomate

The service was excellent tho, out server was very friendly"
28,lamano-new-york,2019-08-11,5,"Lamano has two locations and its team is also responsible for some great Mexican spots in the city: Ofrenda, Black Ant, and Temerario (next door). Like the others, Lamano is a delight but with tapas as its specialty. The Chelsea location has a comfortable and intimate decor making good use of a relatively small space. Happy hour is a good deal made better by using Seated (gerald45 for a bonus anytime). HH drinks included a refreshing $10 cava sangria that was perfect on this hazy summer day. While I can't profess to be an expert on tapas, none of the dishes I've tried have disappointed. Some hh favorites include the manchego (which comes warmed with toast and the traditional membrillo or quince paste/jam) and empanadillas (a mini empanada that came two to an order and had a tasty filling that was the perfect combination of sweet/salty). Service was also outstanding."
28,lamano-new-york,2019-08-06,1,Very questionable hygiene practices here. Walked in and no chef/cook some for first 5 minutes. Fine... Taking a break and I can wait. Turns out she was outside and came in without washing hands then grabbing raw meats then cheeses. All bare hands. Left so I can't comment on food.
28,lamano-new-york,2019-06-21,3,"Pros: Great drinks menu, most of the tapas were pretty tasty. Our waiter was pretty good, especially considering how crowded it was.

Cons: We had a reservation for two people. We got there at the correct time, and the waiter at the front wasn't checking anything with reservations. He said all they had was seating at the bar or seating outside on a day that kept drizzling on and off, but we really wanted to sit at an actual table.
Some tapas (like the tortilla) were a great size; some were tiny (I had just gotten papas bravas at a different tapas place in UES for the exact same price, and comparatively, this was such a tiny portion with tiny potatoes)."
28,lamano-new-york,2019-06-19,2,Cute spot with a good vibe. Service was slow and their kitchen was hot plates... over priced for what it is.
28,lamano-new-york,2019-05-10,4,"Great little tapas place, their dishes are unique and surprisingly good. It's not one of they typical tapas place, we got the oxtail on bread (I don't normally eat oxtail but with the pepper, it tasted pretty awesome), the octopus with potato was a bit disappointing because the octopus tasted a bit fishy, wild mushroom dish came out really pretty (didn't know it was a cold dish, it was sour and spicy so refreshing and tasty), the caramelized sausage was to die for,  the garlic shrimp was good except the shrimp was a bit sandy, their desserts are not my cup of tea (way to sweet) but their coffee with condense milk was gooddddddd"
28,lamano-new-york,2019-04-29,4,Excellent tapas in a friendly atmosphere with great service.  I'd go again!
28,lamano-new-york,2019-04-27,2,Terrible experience.  The restaurant is super small even for NYC standards.  We were seated at the bar and our chairs kept being pushed by the staff due to the lack of space.  The food was sub par - everything was cooked on a hot plate / pre-made.
28,lamano-new-york,2019-04-19,5,"The Jamon Serrano was great, i loved the little pickle medley with it too and their fruit and nut bread was amazing.  The wild mushrooms were good, a little too tangy for me with not much to go with it, just 1 slice of bread betw the 3 of us and we needed something to offset the powerful flavor.   The Pan con tomate with anchovies were really really great. The tortilla was better than we had in Madrid and Barcelona!!!"
28,lamano-new-york,2019-03-25,4,My boyfriend and I went there for a light dinner and it has delicious and great tapas! The place was small but a great place to chill on a Saturday night. We also had a sangria each and the mood fit the vibe at the restaurant. I really loved their octopus dish; it was really flavorful and a great match with the drinks!
28,lamano-new-york,2019-03-17,4,Excellent for tapas and Sunday brunch. Came with 5 friends on a Sunday at 1pm. There were plenty of seats and friendly service. The cafe con leche was good and the brunch menu was amazing. Had the huevos rotos- which is sunny side up eggs over potatoes with jamón serrano. Also split the pajadillo which is a French toast type of dish (brioche toast with manchego cheese with syrup drizzle). Both dishes were great. I'm not usually a fan of Spanish food but this was great!
28,lamano-new-york,2019-03-15,5,Great vibe great food very friendly people I just love this place it's amazing (tapas wine beer and some cocktails)
28,lamano-new-york,2019-03-10,4,The food is great but the service can be a little slow and the place is not great. Some nice dishes such as the fabada and a good wine selection.
28,lamano-new-york,2019-02-27,5,"Was so excited when I discovered Lamano in my neighborhood. I love a good happy hour, and they definitely deliver! The ambiance is cozy, but never overly crowded with great drinks + bites on their happy hour menu. Perfect spot meet up with friends after work or a pre-dinner date!"
28,lamano-new-york,2019-02-20,1,"Service: poor. I was literally the only one in here & the bartender was far more interested in chatting it up with a guy who was sitting at the bar, who i think worked there. Drinks: I had only the sangria, which was average at best. With as many options in the area, this place is skippable."
28,lamano-new-york,2019-02-01,4,"Delicious menu and great happy hour! Service was subpar despite being a small location, which was disappointing to myself and my friends. Would likely recommend due to the quality of food, but don't expect prompt and attentive service from the staff."
28,lamano-new-york,2019-01-25,3,"Nice place but definitely not a place I'd come back to. Good for drinks and decent tapas but for the price you can get much better tapas even around the area. Some unique flavours but so small and a bit overpowering with the seasoning. The Tortilla is just alright, a tad dry for my liking and not a fan of the sauce. Seats con Mina's was good love the mushrooms but a bit too salty, just a bit less would actually be perfect. Arroz Cladoso was good and unique, like the sauce but same if it's slightly lighter it would have been great. Rice was cooked nicely and shrimp was just right. Busy do recommend a reservation if wanting to go. Nice attitude and good service though. Small spaces and high chairs so not good with kids or wheelchairs..can't get to the tables. Just at the corner so not too hard to find. Walkable to blue and red subway lines as well as the L line."
28,lamano-new-york,2019-01-23,5,"We stopped in for Happy Hour on Monday night, the zero degree weather day. The staff was warm and welcoming. It was a little chilly inside so the host very thoughtfully gave me a container of hot water to warm my hands. And, I accidentally knocked my glass of red wine over, breaking the glass. She quickly cleaned it up and helped me to not feel bad about it! Before I knew it, I had a new glass of red wine! I will be back!"
28,lamano-new-york,2019-01-22,4,"Lamano is a great spot for tapas! The service is great and the food is tasty. The drinks are extensive, the sangria options are my favorite in the city! Can't wait to come back soon."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-12-17,5,"This quaint spot is nestled right in the middle of Chelsea and it is so Unpretentious that you may not notice it... but you SHOULD. As a life long New Yorker I know hot spots when I find them, and this is it! Charlie is a phenomenally vibrant and charasmatic waiter/front of house staff who totally sells this place. And if you're still not convinced, Paola is the one woman army behind the skillet whipping out the best Tappas I've had in a long time. Don't miss this place!"
28,lamano-new-york,2018-12-08,5,The service was fantastic. We had a general idea of the wine we wanted and the server brought out great selections. The food was high quality and the atmosphere comfortable.
28,lamano-new-york,2018-11-04,4,"Really cozy spot I'm glad I popped into! Happy hour was a little on the pricier side, but both sangrias are great (red was my fave, though). Pan con tomate was all right, but pretty small and not something I'd go for again here. Got order envy looking around at what people around us had gotten -- will definitely go back to try more of the menu. Recommend you make a reservation since space is tight and they were nearly booked up when we arrived around 5 on a Friday."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-10-06,4,"I stopped by Lamano with a girlfriend for a tapas happy hour-- everything on the special menu, both food and drink, was $8. We were the first ones there at 4 PM on a Tuesday. We both ordered the red sangria which was refreshing and not too sweet.  

Later, we switched to red wine, also on the happy hour menu.  For food, we ordered the patatas bravas, the croquettes, empanadillas, and the bread with tomatoes and garlic. Everything was absolutely delicious.  Well presented and fresh tasting. But tiny. After a few shared plates, we were still very hungry and opted to close out.  We ended up going to get burgers afterwards. 

I would come back here. I think the food is sexy and delicious. But I wouldn't come for dinner, but maybe a snack or a pre-dinner option."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-08-13,5,Amazing Tapas Restaurant! Absolutely worth ordering several of the tapas dishes to share! Very nice decor as well. Super friendly staff.
28,lamano-new-york,2018-07-19,3,"Acceptable tapas. It was better than Bazar but still not very good. Probably worth a stop if you have a craving! We ordered the croquetas ($11), gambas al ajillo ($16), and patatas bravas ($8). The portions are tiny - tinier than other tapas places. Everything was solid, a-ok."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-07-09,5,"Came here twice in two days! Really cute, good service. Fly dropped in our food and they brought us a new one. No questions asked. That's the way! Maahi Ve"
28,lamano-new-york,2018-07-07,4,"Very romantic Spanish wine bar. I got the Spanish version of prosecco/champagne and it was delicious. Got me buzzed, to be honest. I think this is a really great date night spot because it's intimate, and the food-wine pairing is great. Not too pricey in my opinion. Salud!"
28,lamano-new-york,2018-06-30,2,"The tiny plates of fare serve tiny bits of food so you basically leave hungry. Or you can order 9 things for sharing and depart half way okay. The place is small and the ventilation is a big problem. It was unbearably hot when we dined, and all four of us had sweated thru the meal. That's not a good dining experience at all. Since the AC wasn't working optimally, you would think at least the ventilation should work properly. NOPE! It was smokey, it was stuffy, it had no real ventilation. I strongly believe they did all the cooking on a hot plate behind the counter because there isn't a real kitchen anywhere. And the cocktails were disappointing, they lacked flavor and barely had any alcohol. We all felt like we were just drinking juice instead of cocktails. The only saving grace is that the staff was friendly."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-06-12,4,"Cute spanish tapas restaurant tucked away in Chelsea. We ordered 6 tapas items between two people and it was more than enough. My favorites were the gambas el ajllo, chorizo picante and the patas bravas. The Tortilla was my least favorite and a bit too salty. For desert we got the creme brûlée but not sure it was too fresh. They could spruce up their desert for all the sweet tooth's out there like me. Excellent service all throughout and excited to try other dishes on the menu!"
28,lamano-new-york,2018-06-11,3,This place was alright. I was not impressed with the price/portion ratio. The croquettes were VERY good. The lomo and prawns were good as well. It's a fun atmosphere with good service. Not the worst place to try out
28,lamano-new-york,2018-06-09,5,"My husband and I live a few doors down, and were pleased to see this charming small place open. The tapas were incredible, and creative. Some of the best octopus I've ever had, and the potatas bravas were insane.

The service was personal, warm, and attentive. As this place had only been open 11 days, the manager was there, and was very pleased that we were pleased.

It will become a regular rotation for us, when it's not too packed."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-05-08,4,"Cute small brunch spot. Tapas are really solid and flavorful without being overwhelming salty or oily like some other Spanish tapas spots I've been to in the city. The coquettes and potatoesbravas were great (small cuts of potato and easy to share); chorizos really flavorful. Only one I cared less for was the stuffed peppers. The larger mains were good too - particularly if you want something lighter (I ordered the poached eggs with roasted vegis and would get it again- lots of awesome flavor in the vegis but with the poached eggs not heavy at all, so a good balance when combined with the tapas we shared). We came for brunch in the afternoon Sunday and there were hardly any people (think it's still a relatively new place so undiscovered). Service was wonderful - attentive without hovering."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-04-10,4,"5 stars for the drinks! Came here with a girlfriend for happy hour on a Monday, and this just might be the best day to go because it was not crowded at all! Nice little spot to have a catch up conversation over some delicious wine. I tried both their red and cava sangrias. Both very different in taste but amazingly well made and refreshing. The red sangria was very authentic with pertinent notes of grape while the cava was very summery, sparkly and tart! None were dry, like we were told so but don't let those drinks fool you..they are pretty strong! We wanted the croquetilla for app, but mistakenly received the tortilla - egg based and garlicky, not sure if I'd recommend this one, but there were several other items on the tapas list. Servings are very small however, so order accordingly."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-03-24,4,"Came here for happy hour/dinner the other day with the bf. The place itself is rather small and cramped, so I can imagine that you'll be bumping elbows with your fellow patrons on busier nights. Happy hour lasts until 6:30PM on weekdays, and it includes things like $8 tapas specials and a few bucks off some of their plentiful drink offerings. The bf and I ordered a few assorted tapas, which included an order of their empanadillas, pan con tomate, and a montadito. I got a cava sangria as well as a kalimocho, while the bf got a beer.

The montadito took quite a while to come out, for whatever reason, but our server was awesome and kept checking up on us to apologize for the wait. In the end, she ended up comping the menu item as well as the kalimocho, which was a great and pleasant surprise. As for the other items that we had ordered? All of our tapas were quite tasty and my sangria was super refreshing.

The place isn't exactly close to me or really along my route back home, but I would definitely consider coming back here in the near future as the food items were pretty tasty and the drinks were great, also."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-03-24,5,"I've lived down the block from this place since it opened and finally went. It was packed but the hostess worked to find us a seat which was awesome. Food was great, drinks were great. It's a cozy spot so try to make a reservation. Can't wait to go back!"
28,lamano-new-york,2018-03-22,5,"Excellent food and service in a small but comfortable setting. While the size of the portions are bigger than you would expect to find at a tapas bar in Spain, the selection is diverse and delicious - highly recommend the oxtail-stuffed piquillo and any of the montaditos! Recently hosted a private event here that was very well run."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-03-18,5,"This is one of my favorite places in Chelsea 
, literally I love this tiny cute restaurant since you arrive the waitress make you feel super comfy with her beautiful smile, was just wonderful.               Love the food never afraid to try their specials .The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation is just yummy !!!  Highly recommended I will continue coming .."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-03-15,4,"My friend and I came here for HH (til 6:30pm) last night and had a great time. It's a cute and cozy tapas/wine bar with communal seating and bar seating. Service is attentive and fast -- it helped that we were 2 of the total 5 people there hehe.. 

We ordered 2 rounds of the red sangria, roasted manchego cheese, jamon serrano, and croquettas. All delicious pairings to the sangria :) Not an extensive menu, but I'd like to come back for HH and check out their other dishes & the cava sangria that other yelpers rave about.

I'll be back! Love this gem in Chelsea. Great for catching up with friends or a date spot or just a place to escape the hustle bustle of Chelsea Market just an avenue down."
28,lamano-new-york,2018-03-02,3,Nice small local spot for tapas - the empanidillos were a standout. Good happy hour too. BUT...it smells like a bowling alley snack bar because they have little ventilation over the cooktop. It looks like a residential hood over the small stove. I'll wait for outdoor tables before I go back.
28,lamano-new-york,2018-02-02,3,"A little tapas place that had a good selection and an intimate ambiance. 

We ordered the Croquettes, the Cheese & Charcuterie board, the Berenjena (eggplant spread), the Gambas, and a round of red sangria. Overall, the portion sizes were definitely smaller than those at other tapas places. 

The Croquettes were creamy and good but tiny! An order comes with 4 of the smallest croquettes that I've ever seen! 

The Cheese & Charcuterie board had a decent selection but again - super small! 

Gambas were solid, and super heavy on the garlicky oil, which made it great for dipping bread. 

Of the dishes, the biggest letdown was the Eggplant spread which was really sweet and had kinda a coarse texture. 

Overall - it was a good, but not great meal. And you can definitely find something better if you're looking for tapas. If you're looking for ambiance or great service, and don't mind sacrificing taste and portion sizes - Lamano is perfect!"
28,lamano-new-york,2018-01-05,5,"Beautiful, quaint tapas bar in the Chelsea area. Service is pleasant and food is memorable. Highly recommend if you're reading this for inspiration. You cannot go wrong with the Patata Bravas, Chorizo Picante, Boquerones, Coca, Sobrassada!"
28,lamano-new-york,2018-01-01,3,"This was one of the most inconsistent dining experiences I've had in a while. The service was very friendly, decor is nice, and croquettas were delicious (though a bit nontraditional). The jamón serrano was fine, though could have been sliced thinner. However, there was loud late 90s music, which was not only kind of goofy but also felt inappropriate for the space and cuisine. Finally, the tortilla was flat out inedible and the worst food item I'd been served at a restaurant (or anywhere else, really) in a long time. It was simultaneously flavorless on the inside while over salted on the outside. Furthermore the bottom was badly burned. I think if they change their music selection this restaurant is worth trying, just don't get the tortilla."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-12-20,3,"I really wanted to like this small but appealing place given that it's only a block from our house, but was disappointed.  The food is good, but the service is not particularly warm or friendly.  It was very quiet, so the high communal table set-up was fine for us, but with 6+ settings per table, it would be VERY tight with zero privacy.  There is no kitchen - the food is cooked behind the bar on what looks like a portable cooktop, so you'll leave smelling like the food.  I like that they have inexpensive wine choices.
FYI - the recommended tip calculations shown on the check are wrong - I hope that's an honest mistake."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-12-18,3,"Came here for drinks (happy hour is $7 for select drinks) and a bite to eat. This place is small and the seating situation is very stressful especially if you're there with one other person and don't like sitting super close next to strangers. They have 4 high-top tables that seat about 6 people pretty close to one another, so chances are you will be 2 inches away from a complete stranger who will be eavesdropping in on your conversation. Definitely do not recommend this place for first dates or any date really. Since this place is super small, they don't have a kitchen and make everything out in the open. Be prepared to walk out smelling like fried food. My jacket smelled like a high school cafeteria when I left...you've been warned."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-12-08,4,"Authentic tapas place
Tried Lamano for the first time and absolutely loved it. The staff is super friendly and the food is great. You have to try the tortilla, the cockles and the octopus! All amazing. Music super fun too. If you sit at the bar, beware of the fumes. Definitely going back soon!"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-11-30,4,"Came here for drinks, they have a good happy hour. 7$ cocktails and good sangria. 
I would give this place 4 stars, 4 stars because the happy hour menu was good, it's a cute spot in Chelsea, not to big just right. They had good
Sangria and served water in the bottles which is always a nice touch. The food did and smell
Good and was relatively priced tapas happy hour.

Note happy hour 4-6:30pm

We did not try food only drinks, the people next to us had some tapas but we did not.
My date had a fly in her sangria, they did bring her a new glass.
The place doesn't really have your own tables they are like group tables not ideal for first dates or dates in general. 
After I finished my drink, my date still had about half of hers, no one ever came by and asked if we wanted. 
This would be a good spot girls night out maybe. 



Try the cava sangria"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-11-26,5,"Cute spot for tapas and wine, the food iS really good and reasonably priced, the service is very nice"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-10-25,3,"Cute place with excellent value  happy hour but with so many excellent tapas options in Chelsea the food here is just  average.in comparison.


I will say this the staff are amazing and very friendly. 


Ambience 4 starts

Food 3 stars"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-10-23,4,"Cute spot for a glass of Malbec and some cheese, not an extensive menu so I wouldn't plan on having dinner here. It's also pint sized so it's not best for big groups, more of an intimate vibe."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-10-17,4,"The Quick: Great little tapas bar with phenomenal happy hour specials. Wonderful staff. Limited communal seating. 

The Details: What a little gem! Emphasis on ""Little"", this spot is such a charming tapas bar. The menu is authentic and features items such as octopus, potato braves, croquettes and more. The chorizo happy hour dish was delicious! The manager and staff were lovely and everything was very affordable, worth a visit!

The Damage: Happy hour was extremely affordable, I think we spent $20 (pre tip ) for 2 drinks and a large tapas"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-10-11,5,"This authentic Spanish tapas restaurant is a serious stand out among the numerous Mexican and Italian eateries in Chelsea. We almost gave up finding anything really special until we spotted the 3 modest tables on the sidewalk :-) Rickety seating, but who cares when the food and wine is off the chart. The tall tables inside look more comfortable, but we'll do that when the temperatures drop. We had the Fermin Iberico ham aged 36 months. Twice the age, twice the price and twice as good as the Serrano.The Pisto Manchego was outstanding. I have never had olive oil potato puré. I might come back just for that. The wine selection is some of the best Spanish wine I've ever had."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-10-08,4,Sweet place especially when sitting outside on a warm evening.  Great cheese plate and other options.  Good energy and very warm staff.  I wish them much success!
28,lamano-new-york,2017-10-08,4,"A nice tapas and wine bar located in Chelsea--the dimly lit ambience, the bar, and the friendly staff who seem to know their stuff really brings this place together pretty well.  You also have a few tables outside to sit around if the weather is nice.  I think they try to stay as authentic as possible to the Spanish tapas cuisine.

I wasn't particularly hungry, so I didn't get food, but I got some sangria.  I recommend the cava sangria (white sangria) much more than the red sangria.  For me, the red sangria was a bit too bittter--and this is coming from someone who doesn't mind the tannin.  The cava sangria can taste a bit too sour and sweet, but it was still very refreshing especially with the strawberry piece in there.

A pretty nice date spot as well.  The bar itself feels a bit intimate because it's a bit small, but they don't have too many small tables, so you may be sharing a long table with another couple, separated by a chair in between."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-09-25,3,"Was keen to try this place as I am trying to support smaller businesses.  Also the rating was a 4.5 so I thought wow can't go wrong.  
Should have left as soon as I walked in and the place reeked of some sort of air freshener.   It was so overpowering and was nauseating.  Can't believe other people could stand that smell.  They had outdoor tables so I grabbed one.  I could still smell the nasty smell occasionally.  Still hoped the food would make up for the smell!  Our waitress was really lovely and great.  The wines (we tried two reds) were underwhelming basic Spanish reds.  The food was so meh.  It wasn't terrible but really not great either.  This place is pricier than many amazing tapas places right nearby.  Only giving this place a 3 because of decent service."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-09-25,4,"Stumbled upon this cute place last night when my sister and I were looking for a place to have dinner. They have happy hour everyday until 6:30PM for both drinks and food, which was definitely a nice surprise. I got the red wine sangria and my sister the cava sangria, both priced at $7! To eat we ordered the Spanish tortilla, rosemary manchengo cheese, and Jamon from the hh menu. In addition we ordered the shrimp in garlic oil from the regular menu as we'd read good things on Yelp. The Tortilla is like a Spanish omelette with potatoes and caramelized onions which was pretty good and filling. The manchengo cheese was quite pretty as it looks like it was torched a bit on the outside with rosemary but it isn't that flavorful. However, it's a good option to order from the hh food menu to pair with the jamon. Not sure if I would order it otherwise. Our favorite was the shrimp which consisted of juicy shrimp pieces with flavorful garlic chili oil to dip the bread in!

Overall a very cute place to come for dinner on a Sunday night. The place was not crowded at all so it's a good place to come for a casual date or catch up with a friend. And happy hour on a Sunday? Definitely worth checking out!"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-09-16,5,Just excellent. And fabulously reasonably priced. This is the best pan con tomate I've ever had!!
28,lamano-new-york,2017-08-08,5,"Delicious, authentic food, friendly service, and a great atmosphere. So happy to have discovered this neighborhood spot! Will definitely be back."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-07-30,5,"It's a good restaurant for couples or groups, very nice tapas, simple but good food. Service was great and nice atmosphere. Definitely we'll come back"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-07-29,1,"Cute place but the food is a disaster. 
The wine list uninspired and filled with mediocre wines. 
The ""Spanish"" food was as authentic as the row of plastic Jamones hanging in the kitchen. 
The cold sea food plates are crippled with vinegar and seasoned with raisins!
The hot plates are warmed on two hot plates accompanied by a strange brown sauce and even the pan con tomate was strange.  

I paid for my meal twice by getting a bad stomach hours after eating there.  Chelsea is known for decent restraints this place misses the mark."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-06-10,5,"Having spent the day wandering around downtown we thought we deserved a good break and some wine. This spot is small but perfect for what we needed. All the tables are high tops (if that bothers you) and there is also space at the bar. 

Service was friendly. We ordered a bottle of wine and some of the tapas. The wine was based on their recommendation and was just what we were looking for. You can see the chef cooking the food just behind the bar and it was delicious. I would highly recommend if you're in the area"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-06-04,2,"This is a newer place, which I've been to four times, but sadly, the 4th might be the last.  The first three times it was great, new, simple and delicious tapas, fun wine list, and decent value.

However, a few months went by and at my latest visit this weekend, things had changed.  The food is not being cooked the same way or style it used to be, the composition of the cheese and charcuterie plate changed, etc.  The octopus used to be in bite size morsels that you would eat with skewers and would melt in your mouth - now, they are chewy slices that give your mouth a workout.

Anyway, bit of a bummer, this place had a lot of potential to be a go to spot for me, too bad it changed so quickly."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-05-27,3,"3.5 stars

Came here a few months back when they first open. Service was good, nice decor and ambiance for a date. Food was fine but really nothing special write home about. Price is comparable to other tapas place in Chelsea. 

Would drop by when I pass by the neighborhood."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-05-21,4,"One of the best tapas places I've been in the city. Their service is outstanding and the food is absolutely delicious. 

We went here with my family and friends after a ICFF show. We all were very impressed by the tapas. We tried almost all of the tape in the menu. The boquerones, the croquetas, the morcillas, the gambas. and the spinach were the best!!! We also tried the octopus, chorizo, the jamón serrano! Great selections as well. Food wise our rating is 5 stars. The only reason why they lost one star is because they are not handicap accessible. I came with my sister who's had a hard time sitting  in the high stools. 

I would come back and recommend it to anyone!"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-05-12,5,"This could only happen to me. I realized after getting off the subway that I had a cut on my hand the whole time and that I had been holding onto the rail with said hand the whole time. Gross. In search of a place to wash blood off of/sanitize my hand, I wander into this place. I order a beer (great selection, at a wine bar) and used the bathroom to clean up. I then proceed to sit and drink my obligatory beer at the bar and a chef hands me a little skewer of pickled bites to munch on while I have my one drink. I then realize there's an olive on the skewer. I HATE olives and they're one of the few things I won't eat. I was, however, touched by the gesture so I ate it. Not bad! My weird situation turned into finding a classy place with friendly people working there. Will have to come back, until then, one five star beer and free snack."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-05-05,5,"Happened to walk by and found this cute spot. It is very tiny and not much space, but the tapas were delicious. Also, I was impressed with their wine selection and the service....friendly and prompt. Love this place!"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-04-27,3,"I wanted the food to be good, but alas it wasnt. The octopus sauce was too bland and thick, and didn't have any flavor. The croquettes tasted like Pringles. The shrimp wasn't very good (lacked garlic), and the bread tasted like it was left on the counter for the past 6 months."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-04-23,5,Small restaurant feels very cozy. The shrimp was very fresh. Liked restaurant so much we came twice during a NYC trip. Staff is impeccable. Perfect flan. My son LOVED the fried potatoes (sorry I don't know the true Spanish name of the dish)
28,lamano-new-york,2017-04-18,5,"I checked out Lamano the other day and was very impressed. I don't get to eat tapas very often because of some dietary restrictions but Lamano was able to modify some things as much as possible and the menu contained a lot of options that I could even have as is. There was a wide variety of tapas and each one was absolutely delicious. Service was great too.

The wine list also contained a few decent wines. I ended up going with the Monastrell and it was pretty good quality and matched the tapas very well.

The atmosphere is great: cozy and intimate. The perfect place for a more casual date or for meeting up with friends. It is a very small restaurant though, and mainly has communal tables, though we came early enough that this was not a problem.

I can't wait to have a chance to come back here again for more tapas and wine."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-04-15,5,A very nice hole in the wall. Food is delicious and staff is great! Perfect for an intimate brunch.
28,lamano-new-york,2017-04-08,4,"Brunch was tasty, but the true standout was the Bloody Sherry (but could do with less ice). Quaint, hole-in-the-wall cosy. Enjoy the getaway before it picks up traffic."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-03-26,5,Delicious food and relaxing atmosphere. Very authentic according to the ladies I was with that spent semesters abroad in Spain.
28,lamano-new-york,2017-03-21,5,"I had a date in that place and it was perfect. The service and the food were excellent. The staff is spanish. We had the tortilla, patatas bravas and the chorizo picante. The prices are right. I would definitely recommend it!"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-03-13,5,"Looking for good tapas with some Catalan dishes? My friends and I were happy to enjoy a late-night dinner (AKA in our circle as ""Spanish dinner"") at Lamano. A highlight of the night was the Coca- a Catalan flatbread that featured diverse, rich flavors: vidalia onion, piquillo peppers, manchego cheese, and of course, an anchovy. We also ordered La Mano Olives (olives with raisins, pine nuts, lemon, and clover honey), which were addictive. Lovers of galicky shrimp, I'd recommend the Gambas Al Ajillo to you. The Patatas Bravas was solid (nothing out of the ordinary), but it would've been great to try the Croquetas (the kitchen was out- something to hopefully try another time). For dessert, the crème brûlée is a must-try. A plus: it doesn't have that panna cotta texture (if I wanted that texture, I'd get panna cotta!) and comes in a pretty big size. It's perfect for 2 or 3 people to split. The wine selection was good, and the service was friendly. The ambiance is such that this is a great place for friends or for dates."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-02-23,4,"Very cute tapas and wine bar tucked in a quite section of West 20th btw 7th and 8th Avenues. You'll easily miss it if you don't know it's there. A good range of tapas of sizable portion (so you won't spend a fortune by the end of the evening in order to feel satiated), and of course a good selection of wines. Many of the entries on the menu are vegetarian and even vegan friendly. And the ambience is definitely nice for a date or a bite with friends."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-02-20,4,"Lamano is a Spanish tapas spot and when it comes to Spanish tapas, I kind of have a weakness for them and here they do it well. 

Came here with a friend to try it out and at first glance from entering is its cozy yet cool vibe. We ordered a sangria and a kalimocho which are wine-based drinks. The kalimocho was nice with the effervescence of the blackberry liqueur.  As for the tapas, we took three to share: the gambas al ajillo (shrimp with garlic sauce), the croquetas (croquettes with ham), and chorizo (Spanish sausage). Out of those three, the standout was the chorizo which had a spicy pepper slaw and toast. The sausage had a seasoned heat to it with the spices and paired with the toast and peppers, it was a great bite of food. The gambas were good but I wanted the shrimp to have more salt to it while the croquettes were tasty especially with the aioli, the filling was lacking a bit of salt. 

The seating is communal so if you're not a fan of that, well you're out of luck. The service was great and our server did a great job staying on top of everyone's orders as it did start getting busier as the night went on. I can only imagine once this place gets on people's radar.  It's certainly a spot you can take a date out and with solid menu, it's worth a visit. 

Happy eating and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-02-06,4,"Small, great service, good food, nice wine selections just wish it were on a busier block. Not too fond of the area, either. But solid. 

3.5 stars. Everything is very well done."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-01-31,3,"Went here with some friends to grab a bite to eat on a Sunday night. The place is still relatively new and hidden, so we were able to be seated right away.

This place is tapas-style so we just decided to split a bunch of dishes:

Sobrassada (4 stars): This was pretty good and it was easy to share as it was served on three pieces of bread.

Pulpo murcia (4.5 stars): This may actually be some of the best octopus I've ever had in terms of how tender it was. Potatoes were nothing exciting, but the octopus more than made up for it.

Pan con tomate y queso (3 stars): I felt like this dish had potential, but ended up being pretty bland.

Tortilla (4 stars): This was another one of my favorite dishes of the night, though I felt that the aioli was a tad too strong for the rest of the dish.

Patatas a la riojana (4 stars): This dish was also pretty good, had a nice spice to it overall.

Meat and cheese board (3.5 stars): We ordered the largest meat and cheese board that had some good options on it, but nothing that really blew me away.

Peach dessert (2 stars): I don't know what this dish was supposed to be, but it was served to us as warm peaches with some sort of vanilla whipped cream and pistachios. The peaches were hardly soft and not really sweet at all, and the whipped cream did not add much either. Maybe this was a fluke, but I would not bother with this dessert.

Overall, there were some good flavors in some of the dishes, but I really was underwhelmed by the food. The portions were all pretty small, as it is tapas, and sort of all blended together at some point. Also, a lot of the dishes were served with the same bread, so it got to be a bit uninteresting after a while. 

Nevertheless, the service was friendly and the food came out pretty quickly--though I wish they had staggered our dishes a bit instead of sending them all out at once. This place is new and still working out some of the kinks. It is quite small, but provided a nice intimate space for a small group or date."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-01-24,5,"First of all this place exudes ambiance from first sight. I absolutely love the decor. Cozy, dark and sexy. It really feels like a hideaway. They took our jackets and made us feel right at home. I love the hands on approach and being able to watch the chef prepare our plates. The menu is small yet very appealing. The meal started with a complimentary tapas - very nice! We ordered the octopus, razor clams and gambas (shrimps). All the seafood was tasty and had the right amount of heat. Portions are large and quite generous. To finish, we ordered the cheese plate which was one of the best, I've ever had. The blue cheese was incredible. I loved all of the preparations. We were quite full so we skipped dessert. I savored my glass of cava which was nicely dry while my husband had the kalimocho (red wine and coca cola) and the sherry cocktail. Both of the drinks were excellent. I can see us coming every few weeks to try new tapas,  have a conversation and enjoying each other's company. A refreshing welcome to the sometimes very loud New York restaurant scene. A special place tucked into a corner of Chelsea."
28,lamano-new-york,2017-01-15,5,"Living down the street, I had noticed Lamano and picked a snowy Saturday night to try it for the first time. The food was great, especially the octopus and pan con tomate. It was the perfect choice and will definitely be back!"
28,lamano-new-york,2017-01-13,5,"Amazing food and service. I loved all of the dishes I was served, particularly the grilled peach dessert. The chef came over and gave recommendations and even prepared some dishes that are not on the menu for us. 
I lived in Spain for some time and I can tell you these dishes took me back to my time abroad. Taste is 100% Spanish and the tapas are perfectly sized. 
Pricing is appropriate for the quality of the food and the service you are offered. You get what you pay for. 
The restaurant's atmosphere is very cozy, perfect for a quiet evening out or a date. 
I really recommend you give this place a try."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-06-24,5,"Best chocolate chip cookie in New York. I found them right before the lockdown happened, because they are one of the few places that provide Wi-Fi for customers. And the chocolate chip cookies are amazing. Then the lockdown happened. Then I messaged them today via Yelp to see if I could order a cookie for curbside pick up, and they responded really fast and were really nice. When I arrived, the cookies were fresh out of the oven. Delicious!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-03-30,4,"I spent an afternoon here on a weekend to grab a coffee, cookie and do a little bit of work. The coffee here is good - not the best I've ever had, and it was pricey to boot - but their cookies and baked goods are where they shine (granted I only had one cookie, but it was one of the best chocolate cookies I've ever had (and I've had a lot of cookies - homemade and bought at bakeries)

I tried to go to a different coffee shop earlier in the day on a Saturday to do some work and read, but there were no tables available. The layout at Seven Grams is a little more conducive to communal seating so it was easier to find room to sit, and they have a few plugs for charging your laptops. Most the people in here were working on their computers vs. sitting and chatting. 

Definitely better than going to a coffee chain like a Starbucks or Peet's, and if you're looking for a quiet place to sit for an hour or two and do work, this is a good option. Especially if you're craving something sweet and want to get one of the best chocolate chip cookies in NYC. I'll definitely be back here again for another cookie or baked good next time I'm in NYC."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-03-15,5,"I walked in here - super clean, light, lovely, and staff is super attentive to maintaining the space. Good coffee - a little pricey but if you are here and enjoying the space, it is completely worth it."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-03-12,3,"I have been trying to expand my coffee habits. I normally stop at Gregory's for my afternoon coffee but finally ventured into this place as a change up. I just got a drip coffee and added some almond milk. It was okay, but definitely doesn't compare to other shops nearby. I saw that they had a ton of dairy free and vegan pastry options so I'll definitely be back to try those!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-03-07,5,"Come for the chocolate chip cookie, non-vegan one. Coffee is great too but those cookiessssss. They are soft, warm and the chocolate chips are   melty and oozing with yumminess. My favorite cookies were from Levain but their cookies might be tied, just so good. They are not as heavy or as big as Levain so after I finish it, I feel happy but not super heavy. They have so much different pastries, vegan and non-vegan. Lots of sitting space and cute simple decor."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-03-06,1,"It's so hard to find good cafes to work/study at in Manhattan. My sole reason for coming here was to study w/ a friend and enjoy a nice cup of coffee. Prior to coming, I read all the reviews and it says they have wifi, a bathroom, outlets, etc. Basically great for doing work but it wasn't. 
The place is bright and small but it works. I ordered an ice oat latte and scored a seat at the big communal table. We asked for the wifi password (not displayed but pw is latteart) and the internet does not work at all. We tried to connect to it for an hour thinking it was our devices because other people were working in the cafe as well but they probably have hotspots.

The coffee is nothing to die for and was not very good. Instead of the great coffee taste, it tasted very bitter/burnt.

*After I wrote my review, the owner attacked and harassed me but he has since taken down his response."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-02-26,5,"Stopped at Seven Grams for a quick latte and cookie on a Friday evening. It was definitely busier than I would have expected for the day and time, however after trying their drink and cookies I understand why! 

The menu was a classic cafe menu with coffee, espresso, and various lattes. I got a hot matcha latte which was just perfect along with a cortado (espresso with steamed milk) which was great as well. I look forward to trying more of the drinks on the menu in the future. The red velvet cookie was one of the best I have had, and I can't wait to try the other cookies and pastries as they all looked absolutely delicious. There is nothing better than a nice coffee and dessert on any day of the week. 

There was plenty of seating and space to work despite it being a little crowded. All of the tables looked very clean. The workers were friendly and quick. I am excited to return to Seven Grams in the future to try more items while enjoying the nice cafe vibe."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-02-21,3,They have truly good pastries that are almost worth the thousands of calories. Coffee is average and the place is rather lacking the cool coffee place hang out vibe. If you want to grab cookie on the go and don't care for your drink this is your place. Outside of that I wouldn't recommend it
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-02-10,4,"This review is solely for their cookie! I tried the chocolate chip as well as the vegan version! The non-vegan option was awesome: super buttery , chewy and perfectly crisp on the edge. The only thing I'd change would be using dark chocolate vs milk chocolate...but that's totally personal preference! 

The vegan option on the other hand wasn't it for me. They use extra virgin olive oil, which makes cookie quite oily, and tahini, which makes the cookie taste like some nut butter cookie. As a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie, this would have been ok since I love PB, but I would definitely stay away if you're not a fan of any nut butters.

I'd definitely come back here to do work/study! The place is super minimal and even with a lot of people, it doesn't get insanely loud."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-01-29,5,Latte was on point and the organic poppy seed bread was perfect! Place is clean. The baristas are nice as well!!
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-01-25,3,"This place is great! Delicious coffee and tea, spacious tables for working, AND outlets that are near seats. The only  reason why I gave it a 3 instead of a 5 is because they play music like we're in a club and not a coffeeshop. It is SO LOUD. Even with noise cancelling headphones, it's hard to concentrate on the work that you need to done. If they turned it down from an 8 to a 4, it'd be the perfect place to catch up with friends and work."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-01-23,5,"Has the best chocolate chip cookie in the world, THE WORLD. Bring all my out of town friends here and they agree, they try to take some back. When fresh it's super gooey and delicious, also wonderful the next day- no stale cookie here folks! I go almost daily since it's close to my work..."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-01-11,4,"Great coffee but my banana/chocolate bread was a little dry. Tasty, but dry. Could be i was one of the first customers on a Sat morning. Will try again."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-01-10,2,"Skip this place. Asked for a large cold brew, they basically scooped the whole cup with Ice. Requested less ice and the cashier instructed the barista to give me less coffee. 
Im paying for coffee, not ice."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2020-01-04,4,"Ideal cafe for the minimalist in me. Spacious, clean, simple, sleek, modern, aesthetically pleasing. This atmosphere is very calming, open, and inviting. It definitely set me up in the mood for success and not feeling overwhelmed with my work. 

There is a large community table (no outlets) as well as smaller tables (outlets) on the side. Wifi. Delicious chocolate chip cookies warmed up and decent drinks. Staff was pleasant. Definitely will stop by if I'm in the area again."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-12-31,3,"Good coffee, but very sterile place. The WiFi is also absolutely garbage. They also force the folks working the register to ask if u want a pastry every. Single. Time. Just don't live that type of forced interaction... better for grab and go than hanging out for awhile"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-12-27,5,"The best lattes in nyc

The matcha is amazing and dark green (they don't skimp in the matcha, nor do the ""water"" it down with milk).

I love coming here, the WiFi is great, it's close to Madison sq park, and the sweets are amazing too."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-12-27,5,I love whenever I find a coffee shop that has oat milk. The lattes here were delicious. I also ordered a vegan tahini cookie which hit the spot. Will definitely be back here.
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-12-21,5,Great coffee and baked goods. Had one little flourless brownie it was so tasty and chewy. Want to try the baby babka next time (it was sold out).
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-12-07,4,"Love this coffee shop. Great place to work since they have WiFi! (Surprisingly hard fo find good WiFi cafes in the city). Gets super crowded though so find a spot early 

Try their chocolate chip cookie! Think it's one of the best in the city"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-12-06,5,"This cafe is super close to my work place and I had always wanted to go. It's a clean space with decent amount of seats. They have different pastries and coffee options. I had their flat white and banana chocolate bread. Coffee was good and bread was delicious, want to go back soon and work in that space!!!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-12-01,5,"Today was my first time visit, but it won't be my last! It is hard to find coffee shops with plenty of space to work, but this coffee shop had it all. Amazing coffee, delicious treats, quiet background music, free wifi, good lighting, and small/large work spaces of your choosing. 

I will say, outlets are harder to come by unless you are sitting on the right side of the larger table. The coffee is pretty pricey, but it's honestly good coffee. 

I also loved that they don't have plastic straws at all and use lids that don't require straws as a default. They do sell reusable straws if you need them though!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-11-29,5,"This was our first time trying Seven Grams Caffe and everything was perfect! The service was great, the coffee even better, and the dessert was so good we forgot to take a picture before digging in. Everything was very affordable and the atmosphere was simplistic and inviting. Definitely recommend stopping in!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-11-04,5,So glad they're also in NoMad & I don't have to travel to Chelsea for a good cup of joe. Friendly staff and great workspace to whip out the laptop to get done work done!
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-10-12,5,"Came here on a Saturday morning and the barista was rude, apparently you can't ask for a saucer when you are drinking a cortado.  Caught an attitude with me (I was going to brunch I didn't want to ruin my clothes, I'm clumsy). Others also noticed his tone and when I got ready to leave he yelled ""have a good day"" with an attitude, other patrons also noticed.   Just google images cortado mr barista

Good thing NYC has a zillion coffee shops.




Update: the cortado was pretty good and while the location had one bad seed, the owner was quick to reply on yelp and address the situation, something I respect a lot. I don't wish to punish them for someone's attitude problem"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-10-04,5,Delicious coffee. Great open and bright work area with lots of tables and chairs. Electric sockets for charging along the walls. I would get coffee here again without a doubt. The ceramic cups were adorable. Loved the decor both simple and modern.
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-10-02,3,"The space is beautiful, very bright with plenty of seating! The coffee and pastries I had were great. The reason I'm leaving the three star review is that while it could definitely be a great study/work cafe, the WiFi is not great -- often disconnecting when there's more than 5-6 people connected."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-09-21,5,"BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE in NYC!!! I never thought I would stumble upon the perfect cookie at a place like this , given that there are so many places in NYC which specialize in cookies. The chocolate chip cookie is so gooey with the perfect amount of chips. So much better than Levain and Chip NYC. The almond croissant is also amazing here. I haven't tried the coffee here yet, but this is my go to place for pastries and cookies now."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-09-17,4,"Nice place to meet up with a friend or get some work done. It's a 5 min walk from my place of work so I usually go there with a colleague to take an afternoon break and get a tea/coffee. 

Try the babka and the vegan choc. chip cookie!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-09-16,5,Great drip coffee and walnut pumpkin bread for breakfast at your desk.  Relaxing decor and never too packed inside.
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-09-14,5,"Great chai tea latte! Worthy every penny 
I had time to kill before my dinner reservation, so my boyfriend and I stopped by to cool off. 

The barista was very friendly.

The store was clean and had plenty of seating. Great location for meeting up with someone, studying by yourself or just hanging out. 

Too bad that this location closes by 7pm."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-09-13,3,"The drink I got was chai latte with oat milk!
It was tasty but pre pricey $5.75
Their pastry looked so good and smelled mad
Fresh! Music was a bit loud so not a prime study spot."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-09-11,5,"Wonderful experience. Had the Americano with a nice warm toasty chocolate croissant.  It's a nice place to chill on your way to work. The hustle and bustle of New York citizens around you and within the store makes you thankful just to relax and sip on coffee,  not a worry on your mind,  look around and realize how busy everyone is."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-08-25,3,I love this place don't get me wrong but they've been stingy with the chocolate chips in the cookies  Two times now my cookie had had a total of 2 chocolate chips inside ‍ - I'll come back for coffee but no more cookies for me... disappointing
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-08-01,4,"Stopped by this caffe to get their ice coffee. Great decision. It's fresh, smooth, not too strong, not bitter, and it do not leave that nasty after taste. The Caffe is nicely distribute, clean, and smells good. It's a good environment to relax, drink a cup of coffee, knock out some emails, or simply to meet friends and enjoy. I recommend Seven Grams Caffe."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-06-26,2,"Menu lists both iced coffee and cold brew, though at shockingly high prices (small iced coffee: $4.75).  Personally, I don't like cold brew; too strong.  Ordered iced coffee; response ""Is cold brew ok?"" I responded it wasn't; no response at all from clerk, who just stared into the distance.  There is a cash tip jar in the counter.  I tendered cash to pay for order, was told business does not take cash.  Left."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-06-17,5,"I've had the nitro cold brew a few times and it's certainly stands out compared to the other ones I've had in the area, has almost a nutty background taste to it but also has that nice creamy texture of a typical nitro cold brew 

Reasonable amount of seating, though it can be difficult to get a table given the high volume during the day

Atmosphere is great very bright and tons of natural light from outside

Fairly standard selection of coffee options and prices are typical of the area

The baked goods options are where this shop really stands out they have a ton of unique cookies brownies and other delicious options."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-06-17,4,"I got the chocolate chip cookie.

I got the almond croissant.

good food."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-06-13,5,Tons of coffee shops in NYC and I'd put seven grams at the top 10%. In one sip you can tell how good their coffees are.
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-06-05,5,"Looking for a good coffee spot and a good time? Seven grams is great spot for that! Came here on a date and didn't have problems with seating at all.

Indulge in a flat white or even 2 because they're amazingly good. Their flat whites definitely remind me of those I had in Melbourne! 

I didn't have the chance to try their pastries but I'll definitely be back!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-06-04,5,"My fave coffee place!!! I never thought the day would come where I would stop enjoying Starbucks and spending all my money there, but it finally happened. The coffee, iced lattes, and pastries are AMAZING (banana chocolate loaf and blueberry lemon loaf are the only ones I've tried so far). They also have oat milk! :) The employees are very sweet as well."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-06-03,5,"Seriously one of my favorite coffee and chocolate chip cookie places in the city. I always get a cappuccino with oat milk + vegan tahini chocolate chip cookie or regular chocolate chip cookie or the matcha and white chocolate or brownie. Yes - I know... I've got a serious sweet tooth  

Great now I want a cookie ‍"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-05-20,5,Perfect cappuccino and pastries are flaky fresh and very tasty. Very friendly staff adjusted my cappuccino to how I like it without hassle. Nice atmosphere
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-05-12,5,"Great cafe with high quality coffee, very pleasant and personable staff, as well as tasty pastries when you want to indulge.  I live in the area, and it's my favorite coffee spot by far.  Highly recommend!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-05-12,5,Seven Grams is a beautiful coffee shop with excellent service! I love the Almond Mocha here so much! and the matcha cookie :)
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-05-04,4,"Great ambiance, space, and service. Iced Soy Latte was $6, so on the pricier side, but it was tasty. Perfect ambiance to study, work, or for a date."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-04-19,5,I never write reviews. This is in fact my first review. The chocolate chip cookie I got from Seven Grams today was perhaps on par with Levain. So delicious and gooey. The cold brew is also incredibly strong and full of flavor. Will definitely be returning.
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-04-13,5,"Love the minimalist decor, wooden tables, white walls, funky cups. So clean and so nice to sit at and people watch. They make good lattes too. Cookies are deadly (SO MOIST). Best place to meet a friend to catch up or just to study or work on your laptop."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-04-09,5,"A bright coffee shop with a view of skyscrapers outside.. great place to get some work done or have a coffee with someone and really feel like you're in NYC. Bright lighting, wooden decor, outlets, WiFi (sometimes), and bathrooms.

Cons: seating was limited when I came here on a Saturday afternoon and Monday at 3, but the turnover rate is pretty high and if yours willing to stand around for 5-15 minutes there's a good chance you'll find a seat. 

Coffee: prices are steep but for the amenities and location, not bad. The latte was so rich and creamy, I wish I had more."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-04-07,4,"My sis were in the area and stopped by this little bakery for something to quench our sweet tooth. My sis ran in and brought us back two cookies, one was a gluten free chocolate chip and the other was a regular chocolate chip.

We tried both to compare. The gluten free cookie was thick and gooey and tasty wonderful. We tried that one first and the regular cookie after. I have to say that the gluten free version was ten times better. If parking was available I would have gone in also. It's definitely worth another visit."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-04-03,5,"Solid coffee shop to study at! Large windows for lots of natural light and enough seating for about 20 people, which is fairly decent. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to connect to their wifi the few times that I did go.

There is music but the others around me were hard at work and not chatting loudly.

Love how frothy/creamy their cappuccino​s are and their baby Nutella Babka is pretty delicious."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-03-30,5,"I walked 9 miles and needed a snack...passed by and saw the prettiest pastries.walked in and saw boxes of different cookies. Opted for the cluster looking one that had slivered almonds. They were called florentines but the actual flavor or texture is not. These are chewy w a crunch, not as buttery and not as sweet as a Florentine. Still good. Aaaaaaand the thing I would highly recommend is the tahini brownie. A hint of sesame flavor, not chewy, has a bite, but at th same time it's soft. Yum."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-03-02,5,"It truly is the perfect pull of espresso! Great music, service, and cozy environment. The almond croissant was delicious too!!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-02-26,5,"The vegan tahini dark chocolate chip cookie is all that!!!! Totally unique. 
Nutty and flavorful filled with chocolate chunks- worth the trip!!!!!!
$4.00"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-02-25,5,"Great coffee. Fantastic ambiance. Super friendly staff. Pastries are amazing. Please keep the porcelaine mugs, it makes a big difference."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-02-23,5,"My new go to for coffee! Came here a few times, planning to come here more often for my wake me up coffee (:
This is a block away from the 6 train on 28th, so perfect location for me. Not too loud during the weekdays in the early Mornings but def more busy on the weekends. 
I've consistently been getting the iced vanilla latte with OATMILK and love that they don't over power it with sweetness. 
What really draws me to seven grams are their pastries. They have baby Nutella babkas! Perfect to go along with my coffee. They have a variety of other pastries that I'm excited to try out too. 
The staff is nice and the service is pretty quick. 
Will def be coming back!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-02-20,5,"It seems like yesterday when I went to my first yelp event at Seven Grams Caffe on 7th ave. They had opened pretty recently and I got to visit and make some latte art. Fast forward 4 years (wow!) and happy to see they are successful and recently opened the Madison Ave location a couple of months ago. I love the cups and saucers they use and also how open and airy the space was. There is ample seating and the baked goods smell heavenly. I didn't get coffee that time, but can't wait to go back to have some more coffee!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-02-18,4,"I stumbled upon this cafe when the one I wanted to go to was closed and am happy I did. I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk which came with a matching cup and plate which was adorable. It was a bit too strong for me even after adding two stevias and a lot of cocoa powder and cinnamon, but I tried my friend's chai latte with oat milk and it tasted amazing. The cafe has ample seating and It was a great place to chat with my friend and then read. I grabbed a chocolate chip cookie on the way out because it looked and smelled fantastic - it had a huge chunk of chocolate in the middle. I heated it up so it was gooey and think it was one of the best cookies I've had in the city."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-02-12,4,"Great cookies and pastries. I usually deny myself the joy of a sweet, but I always get a chocolate chip cookie here. The coffee can be hit or miss. I've had good cortados and bad cortados. But the space is beautiful and open and not a bad place to get a little work in. Service is super friendly as well."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-01-30,5,"This is my everyday coffee spot. Great place. I normally go with the plain ole brew coffee, but their latte is great, decorative and smooth."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-01-28,3,"I'll give this place a generous 3stars.
It's a nice looking place on the inside. Very open, tall ceiling, lots of light, and very clean. There's a good amount of seating for people. A place where people either like to shoot the shit for awhile or work for a bit.
The customer service was friendly as we asked their recommendation on their favorite baked goods and were rung up quickly.
Waited a few minutes on the other side of the counter to get our drinks made as they'd call out names and drink.

What I ordered:
Friend got a small latte drink
I got a large hot chocolate
Also got a chocolate peanut butter cookie

The cup sizing is just awful especially for the price point they're asking for. Small is just a tad under the usual 12oz cup you might find in your office and the ""large"" is just a tad taller...I guess this is what you get for hipster type cafes like this. Just overpricing.
My hot chocolate was warm...on a cold day i kinda want my drink hot like the name implies.
It was good I'll give them that but this large cup would be considered small anywhere else and especially asking $5.5 for it is not worth it.
The cookie was good, very sweet and rich!

My lasting impression is the sizing and price point of their drinks...dunno if I'd come back or recommend"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-01-22,5,"Great cafe, with a clean, modern design, lots of seating, WiFi, and delicious coffee. My cappuccino (pictured) was fantastic, and bonus points for serving it in unique china!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-01-15,5,"Another great coffee shop in the Flatiron district on Madison Ave. This one is just exceptional as it is spacious, clean, and delicious. I love the ambience of Seven Grams. The ample amount of room it holds for larger parties is phenomenal! I enjoy the communal table in front of the register with extra pastries sold in the middle isle. So many creative individuals sit here. The baristas are always happy to accommodate you and recommend any drinks or food when needed. Prices are decent but a little bit on the expensive side of coffeeshops in Manhattan. My recommendation for people who love matcha is to go with the matcha white chocolate cookie! So worth it. I find I don't finish it very quickly and can last for a good amount of time while huddled on my laptop to work a couple of hours. Yes, this is a cafe to work in! WiFi is available and outlets as well. It gets noisy and busy here on certain times as patrons also like to just chill and chat with their partners. Coffee is just right. I believe they only accept card (but I could be wrong). 

Accepts card.
Bathroom in back. 

Drink up!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-01-13,4,"Came in for a cup of tea and dessert with a friend. We got the the jelly cookies and they were extremely good. The man who sold it to us told us that it was made in house and recommended it. 


When we came in, I believe it was a soft opening. The place still looked like it was still under construction near the bathroom but it still looked very modern and sleek. I'd come back if I was in the area."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-01-09,3,"Very modern and pretty place. Lots of seating and a great spot to work and catch up with a friend. 

I didn't find the selection of baked goods and drinks that great. I got the hot chocolate and my friend got a macchiato. We shared the matcha white chocolate chip cookie. Nothing was particularly tasty and it was all pretty pricy (though, probably typical for NYC prices). Much better bakeries and cafes elsewhere.

It's def. a chill place to hangout for a bit though."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2019-01-03,5,"I find myself leaving 260 sample and wanting some caffeine and pastries after doing some hardcore shopping. This place thought about what you feel when you walk in here. The minimalist feel with quality pastries and top notch coffee makes you sit and admire your surroundings. Bathroom yes, outlets yes, space is good (meaning you can sit with your laptop and no one will bother you)."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2018-12-31,3,"$4 for a large, plain coffee that tastes fine (good but not great). Doesn't have a burned taste but not sour either which was nice. You can't see the menu if you're at the counter - only if you stand far away which is a design flaw (function for a menu should be more important). Everything costs a little more than it should given the great options nearby.  Cafe chanson and Maison Kayser have similarly priced options and there stuff is so much better. At 8:45 am nobody was in there but us and one other person. Given the options nearby wouldn't rush back."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2018-12-31,5,So glad they opened a location here right by Mad sq. park!  Coffee was smooth and great.  Chocolate almond croissant was the best I've had in a long time!
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2018-12-23,5,"Great space, the coffee is amazing and they have very good pastries and cakes. They also have really nice guys serving."
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2018-12-08,4,Cappuccino and latte was good. They have very cute mugs. The place is spacious but busy. We stopped by in a middle of the day during workweek and every table was taken. Barista did a very nice job. They also had a lot of desserts available.
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2018-12-07,4,"I stumbled upon this location on my way home from school, and I was impressed! This location recently (three weeks ago at the time of my visit). I ordered an iced black tea. Standard, can't go wrong with an iced black tea. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie, which the cashier was able to heat up! First of all, the cookie was huge. Second, delicious!! 

The location is spacious, clean, and aesthetically pleasing. There is a large rectangular table with plenty of stools to sit on. There are also a decent amount of smaller tables and seats. I was able to study here for a couple of hours with a friend right until closing time. Wifi available and a couple of outlets you can plug your devices into to do work.

The staff was friendly, very pleasant. I would love to try their coffees, will probably update my review once I do!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2018-12-01,5,"One of my favorite NYC coffee roasters has a new location! A much more spacious location. I would frequently go to the Chelsea location when I have visitors, and I am very happy about the new Flatiron location. They have their classic menu of espresso drinks, but they have more room for their homemade baked goods and a selection of packaged baked goods to go. Looking forward to bringing some of these home with me. 
Their baristas are patient and friendly. They make beautiful latte art and are attentive to their customers. 
This location has free Wifi, customer bathroom, and much more seating -- some things I noticed the Chelsea location lacked (not that I still don't love the Chelsea location!). Love that this Flatiron location can be a place where I can do some work and enjoy a baked good with coffee. Will definitely be coming back again!"
29,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-7,2018-11-24,5,"Beautiful and spacious caffe unlike any other coffee shops in the neighborhood! Free wifi and well lighted makes it a perfect place to get some works done!!

Recommend their cappuccino, strong enough while you don't taste the bitterness of the coffee!! Well done!!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2020-06-06,4,"I ordered this online and they said the expected time was 10-20 min. However, I realized I placed the order for the wrong location, so I called in less than 3 minutes after placing my order. Unfortunately, they had already made my drink and said they can't do anything about it. 

I was pleased to pick up my Thai Milk Tea with boba (70% sugar, less ice) about 20 minutes later (we walked really fast across NYC basically) and the drink still had ice in it. Usually, when I order drinks with less ice, all the ice disappears within 10 minutes after the drink is made. 

Overall, though Vivi's is not the best in NYC. But for simple and relatively cheap bubble tea, it is a great option. They are pretty consistent store to store, which is something that's hard to find for bubble tea stores."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-10-02,2,"I got a brown sugar milk tea. I wanted to adjust the sugar and ice level because I find that sometimes bubble tea places can make it too sweet for my preference. However, the barista told me that it will mess up the formula. So that gave me high expectations.. but it was disappointing. The tapioca was so bad. It was not chewy and the inside was still dry/hard. I was wondering if they just bought premade tapioca from the supermarket. And the milk tea itself just tasted like a regular milk tea but a little salty. Very disappointing drink that costed me almost 6 dollars. Not going back for their bubble tea again."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-07-25,5,Wow! They have great drinks! My favorite is the earl grey with boba every the appetizers are great! Would reccomend to friends and fam!
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-07-17,4,"TLDR: Great place to get real Taiwanese teas and bubble teas that you can customize to your liking! They even have ice jelly! Overall rating: A


I love that you can customize the ice amount/sugar amount/types of adds in for your drinks, and there are even non-lactose (Lactaid) options. They sell some light Japanese foods but honestly I'm just here for the bubble tea. I got a medium size black milk bubble tea with 30% sugar and little ice! YESSSSS! It hit the spot! The tapioca balls could've been chewier, but still good. The black tea was ever so slightly floral. Love this place! When it's hotter I'm getting 50% sugar and regular ice. Small space with not much seating inside. Sometimes there are pretty long lines but it moves fast! A little pricey at $5.36 (including $1 tip) for a medium but I would return when the bubble tea craving hits! 

In the future, I'm interested in trying these new drinks:
-3Q Milk Tea (with tapioca, pudding, and herb jelly!)
-Peach Aloe Fruit Tea (peach pulp, aloe, ice jelly, chia seed)
-Grapefruit Fruit Tea (grape fruit pulp, orange, Pineapple, ice jelly, chia seed)
-Mango or Lychee or Taro Slush"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-06-12,1,"Came here to enjoy a bubble tea.

Stand by and wait to be acknowledged. Wait. Wait. Wait. Failure.

Go over by the register. (maybe I was standing in the wrong place). Wait. Wait. Wait. Failure.

There's 4 people begging the counter of this 200 sq ft store. All 4 give be a dirty look as if I'm in the wrong place and inconveniencing them. They ignore me and continue chatting with each other. 

Leave without a bubble tea.

Stop in if you want to remember your high school days."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-05-19,1,The bubble tea is okay - but the service could've been way way better. It was a little crowded when I got there and there was only one person making drinks while others stood around. I asked the lady who took my order what the lowest level of sweetness was and she whispered the answer - literally had to ask her to repeat herself twice and could still barely hear her. I got my card out and she pointed to the card reader and handed me my receipt - no thank you or have a nice night or anything. We were the only ones in the store by the time my drink came out - she never called my order out but had called other orders out before and my drink was probably sitting on the counter for a couple minutes. I feel like if you noticed there was one person in the store you should tell them their order was ready? Will most likely not come back here.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-04-30,1,"This is by far the slowest bubble tea place I have ever been to. I ordered my drink on a Tuesday around 8pm, not very crowded. It took 3 people to man the single cashier spot and they had one person making all the drinks. The person making the drinks was tremendously slow and was not very good at the process. She left my drink on the machine for 10 minutes while she moved on to another drink. Don't come here if you want your drink quickly."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-04-09,4,Great service and nice staff. Ordered the grapefruit yakult (yogurt) and it was soooo good. The place is super small. About 4 people can fit before it gets uncomfortable.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-04-02,5,"This is a really large Vivi with seating inside as well. I ordered my usual Peach pulp tea with aloe in it, and it tasted great as usual! This place accepts cards and there was no minimum amount or drink you needed for it. 

I was really surprised to see on the menu for this Vivi included real food besides just drinks. It had ramen and some other snacks, which I saw some customers eating. Might try some of these next time I am around the area again!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-03-19,4,Decided to grab bubble tea before we hit up Chelsea market. We ordered the Thai Milk Tea and it was delicious! I'm so glad we were able to try this bubble tea chain during our trip to NYC.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-02-28,2,"We came here on a cloudy Saturday with no expectations. We've been to Vivi before and had enjoyed their drinks and we wanted a snack.

We arrived in the afternoon to a crowded area. As we patiently waited in line, we perused the menu. I initially asked if there was a student discount and the cashier didn't seem to understand and seemed irritated by my question. That's fine, I ordered a large taro milk tea with bubbles and 30% sugar, my usual.

The line for drinks was really backed up and it only looked like one person was doing the drinks. We waited for about a full ten minutes, but given the crowdedness it was still fine. The waiting area is very cramped so I would avoid during the busier hours.

When I finally received my drink, there were a lot of bubbles, which was awesome. The drink was still too sweet for my liking, I'm wondering if they used Lactaid milk. It was more sweet than creamy as I would have expected.

Overall: generic bubble tea, not much pizzazz or fanfare to it. Service isn't great."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-02-18,4,"Small yet efficient place. The location and crowd I found are all clues that they know how to crank these tasty drinks out. I ordered my usual almond milk bubble tea (I really need to try something new) and it was delicious. I am truly addicted to these teas and I'm sure I'll be worse in the hotter climates. Anyway, try a flavor of choice and you can thank me later."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-02-12,5,"I love this bubble tea store! I've been to many varieties of Vivi bubble teas in china town, and one around 14th street, but I definitely like this place the most. It is partially because It Is the most easily accessible for me, but also because of the quality of the bubbles! They are really soft and sweet and the best I've had out of all the stores. The bubbles tea tastes good overall too!

The improvement could be the service. I have had situations where I asked for less-ice and got served the normal amount of ice which can be frustrating. But the main issue is the lack of knowledge some people have with the orders- I sometimes find myself ordering a milk tea and paying an extra 50 cents for bubbles when some of them come WITH the bubbles! Some of the staff know that they come with the bubbles, but others don't and I ended up getting charged extra for no reason! Sometimes I do end up just asking if it comes with bubbles and making sure that I don't have to pay extra for the ones that DO come with bubbles, but it can be hard to remember sometimes. Drinks like yellow moo milk and the original come with bubbles, but apparently Thai and Jollypop don't, so I recommend clarifying if you ever go! 


Other than that small suggestion, I love this vivi so much and enjoy my drink every time!!! The tea and bubbles are good quality and I would recommend!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-01-10,1,"NO POPCORN CHICKEN HERE!!
walked 15 minutes here after work one day only to find that they don't have popcorn chicken here. big bummer and i don't understand why they would decide to do this -- the popcorn chicken is the main reason i go to Vivi's over other tea places. guess i'm never coming back"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2019-01-08,4,"Service was fast, lady was helpful and the 3Q bubble tea has a strong tea flavor.  Generous toppings yoo.!!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-12-21,3,"Vivid Bubble Tea is definitely a solid chain  boba shop. The very first time I tried their drinks was when I visited NYC in 2013. They also have a shop in Chicago and San Diego, CA. They have a huge variety of drinks to pick from so there's something for everyone. I definitely think their cold drinks taste better than their hot ones. During my last visit I ordered a hot milk tea with boba which I'm pretty sure they stuck in the microwave to heat up. Overall, this is a legit spot to grab some boba."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-11-03,5,"I have put few picture as they have some specials. Good for bubble teas and I got jasmine ice tea without bubbles. Normally I drink it with bubbles but I wasn't feeling well I just wanted something to drink so I got honey jasmine tea.
Place is pretty small and packed. Around evening it was packed and noisy cuz all the school kids were here. Basically it is good for bubble tea. I tried the jasmine and it is really great."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-09-28,1,"Ordered a taro slush today and was told that they were ""out of slush,"" despite my seeing several slushes in the pickup area of the counter. So I asked why they were out of slushes because it's ice and powder, the exact things used to make non-slushes which were in stock, and was literally told they just weren't going to make me one because ""we're busy.""   

After coming here for two years, I'll be going to Avalon just across 7th ave because their service is always super friendly and their slushes are cheaper."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-09-16,3,I got the oolong milk tea here yesterday and thought it was just okay. It had too much of the milky taste and lacked in the tea flavor. The other times I've had Vivi were better.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-09-08,1,"The server was so busy talking to a friend she forgot the custard, then stalled making product, asked me for 50 cents for the add on she forgot, then gave the add in to her friend for free"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-09-04,2,"Honestly not a fan of the service or the design/layout of this Vivi store. Not much seating and the tables were sticky! 

Service is nonexistent and drinks are subpar. I'd rather walk to Boba Guys near Washington Square Park or splurge on Argo tea, which is probably healthier and near Union Square."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-08-28,4,"Why 4 stars? Because I've definitely never seen Tiramisu boba tea before!

   ---   ---   ---

We made an impromptu stop here, and when I say impromptu, I mean that my wife saw it as we were walking by and said, ""ooo boba,"" and immediately went inside.

I wasn't as convinced due to the 3.5 star rating, but she had already made her mind up. I quickly shifted to optimism though when I saw that I could order a Tiramisu slush with boba. I've been to many-a-boba place, and I have definitely never seen Tiramisu as a flavor. 

It ended up being just a tad heavy on the thick coffee flavor, but was still quite enjoyable. My wife ordered a mango slush and I was having a bit of envy over hers, but #noragrets, as they say. One thing that definitely stood out was the thickness of these slushes - while the wife wished it was a bit more watery, I was happy with the thickness. It allowed it to last longer, because I'm a fast sipper.

I'd definitely visit again!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-08-14,5,"SOOO delish!!

I've tried many other places but these guys know what they're doing. Vivi Bubble Tea is my go to dessert place in the neighborhood."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-08-13,3,"Ordered taro slush with tapioca. Was okay, nothing life changing. Cute decoration though. Not much space to sit. Get in and get out type of place."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-08-05,5,The options here are incredible! Loving the strawberry tea today with the classic tapioca!
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-07-28,2,"I had the Lychee tea, which is great but be prepared for a wait! It was hot and muggy out, and no AC in the store just a fan. Service is super slow."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-07-01,3,"Mediocre bubble tea, I got the kumquat lemon slush and it was $4 instead of $3.75, the large is $5. Very watery. The place itself is small but I think the food here is good saw them packing a lot of food orders and there is a special here from 11 am to 2 pm I believe."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-07-01,1,Wtf they don't have bubbles and they didn't tell me I already ordered and they gave me something else? Literally the worst bubble tea place ever
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-06-18,5,The place is so small that it has seating for only about 15 people. I enjoyed the sushi and my Jasmine lemon Jade Tea.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-06-06,5,"Enjoyed the nice customer service and the drinks were really good. My only complaint is that the boba balls were warm, not exactly sure why; I've never had them warm before, not a fan. The inside is really cute and even though it's a small store it's really nice. I had the taro Milk tea with black boba and my fiancé had the tiramisu milk tea with whip cream black boba."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-06-02,5,"Great bubble tea, great staff, just pray you don't go during rush hour. This place is small and the layout is strange. Often I can't tell who ordered and who hasn't. Fortunately, they make a superior product. Classic green tea has a bitter taste. These guys have a method that removes a good amount of the bitterness. They give you great customization options as well in the form of how much ice, sugar, different add ons such as lychee, popping bubble etc. It's always fun trying something new. Their popcorn chicken is fantastic as well."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-05-26,2,"It is in a great location but they need to do something about the layout of the store. Maybe take away some chairs? I have no idea but while you are standing and waiting for your drink it's really hard to not smack somebody in the face with your body let alone your bag. The workers there are incredibly slow. If you are in a rush to go anywhere, do not bother ordering bubble tea. I saw my tea just sitting there waiting to be sealed. I would say they need to staff someone else but I don't even know where that person would stand. 

The tea, when I finally got it, was good. I love the ViVi franchise but this store is going to be a no from me dawg."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-05-24,4,"UPDATE:I decided to come back and I'm glad I did. The bubble tea is great. 4 stars because of my prior experience. 

15 minutes for a terrible honey dew.... 

The crew spent more time discussing a previous customer than making a simple drink"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-05-04,3,"I might be too used to the boba places in LA, because I normally get less sugar and it's perfect for me. Here, I got 3/4 sugar with the boba milk tea and I wish I had gotten 1.5x instead. The boba itself was good, but the milk tea ended up being pretty bland."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-04-26,3,"Gotta be honest, it was ok, but just ok. Might be because I'm from California and there are about a hundred boba places on every corner so I'm used to really good tea drinks, but the drinks we had were just average.
My wife got the honeydew milk tea, which had a weird liquid to powder ratio and tasted too thick, and I had the tiramisu slush, which didn't really taste much like anything at all, a little too light on the flavor.
Maybe it was just this one place or one day, but I'd pass and try somewhere else next time."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-04-09,2,"Ordered the large green milk tea with tapioca and as usual it was great!

However, the layout of this restaurant is a mess which made my visit very unenjoyable. It is a small place with lines out the door at times. The setup didn't allow the flow of people to move seamlessly which made me feel a little claustrophobic. Love Vivi's but won't be returning to this location."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-04-04,2,"Good sizes for large and they put a lot of bubbles in there. But the inability to move costumers in and out quickly and increase sales in probably very low. I came in around 6pm, now their was 2 people in front of me but it took about 10 minutes to make my bubble tea and it was nothing elaborate. The place is about the size of a small closet. I watched 3 people stand there and 1 make drinks and she moved very slowly. As I stood waiting for my boba tea the pickup line grew from 3 to 7 and 10 minutes later they had only made mine. I feel bad for the rest of the people waiting. As people came in they would get whacked by the door. If you have time stop here if your in a rush go somewhere else because speed is not one of their strong points. Won't be back to this location."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-04-02,3,Bubble tea is good the only thing im not a fan of is the customer service it could be better. I have been here a couple of times just because i like how they make the bubble tea but the workers here seem to be in their own world and take too long to bring out the orders. i have been to other Vivi Bubble Tea locations so i know it shouldn't take that long. would recommend for the staff to step up their game with customer service so line moves faster and orders come out quicker. shouldn't take 15-20 min for a bubble tea.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-03-29,1,"We walked in before 10, waited in line, then got to the front and they said they're closed and kicked us out.  Pretty rude."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-02-28,2,"Drink was comparable to other Vivi locations. But the fact that the crew socialized and flirted with one another loudly, and the fact that they went on and on about how two crew members were having bloody noses, it took them a while for them to notice me. I contemplated leaving. This was on a Wednesday, 7:30 PM."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2018-01-15,5,"I love the ViVi franchise!!! This location was small, and not very busy at the time, which was perfect for us! I got the Milk Thai Tea with Tapioca pearls. It was delicious. Will definitely come back to this location again."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-11-27,3,"If you are in the area and looking for a bubble tea, then I would recommend this place. However, be warned that it can get really crowded and it can be hard to find a seat. In addition, this place is kind of disorganized. However, they have good tea and you can get your bubble tea fix here."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-11-17,1,"The people that work here are very  angry  kids looks like they  forced to work. They speak  very little English ,"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-11-12,3,This is not as authentic but it's as good as it gets. The milk tea and boba is passable and is a solid 3/5. The popcorn chicken is too salty and too powdery.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-10-25,3,Inexpensive and decent food- nothing special though. Ordered the spicy California roll and the lychee slush bubble tea. Tip- ALWAYS ask for less sugar! Way too cloying. For the price point the sushi was alright.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-10-14,2,"I love bubble tea and was elated to see Vivi was near my office. Alas, it was a true disappointment for the few times I've been there in the past. Their teas are too ""milky"". It feels like you're drinking milk. I've gotten their taro and coconut flavors, and it's been milk every time. Better bubble tea at other establishments."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-09-11,4,Yummy bubble tea. My wife and I shared a large peach with pulp bubble tea and it was really yummy. Not too sweet at all. Their boba is also yummy and fresh tasting. They have a great menu of a bunch of different items. The only drink i would not order again is their thai iced tea. It definitely did not taste like Thai iced tea. I also appreciate their calories being very well visible so I can stick to the plain teas to watch those pesky calories.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-09-08,3,"Waits can be long for the slightly pricey ramen, and weekday rush hour crowd, but the bubble tea is always delicious. I usually get the passion fruit bubble tea and ask them to hold any extra sugar (it's an additional ingredient). The ramen is good, especially the veggie ramen with miso broth. Again, the only con is the wait for ramen after it's ordered."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-08-25,3,"Ordered the peach ice jelly since it was showcased on their top 10 orders.

Glad the staff were informative about their products! I wanted to try the drink but didn't know what was in it so I asked and the staff answered me right away.

Its a peach flavored tea with peach jellies. A pleasant drink for the summertime!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-08-18,4,"Recently moved here from Toronto, and was looking for some great bubble tea in the city. This is the spot!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-07-12,4,"The bubble tea is pretty good but I wish they had a better selection of jellies. I love the matcha slush, it's good but not too sweet. The atmosphere isn't great it's cramped and it seems like they don't have ac. Not a place I would hang out compared to other tea houses in the area."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-05-28,4,"great coconut milk tea. very creamy and good flavor. it's already sweetened so i asked for zero sugar and it was perfect. i really like the boba here as it tastes very fresh, softly chewy, and not too sweet."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-05-25,2,"The selection is pretty big but not huge. It is definitely not the best bubble tea I have had. The place is small but cool. My main problem is the food. I decided to get something since I was there, the sushi is just okay the dumplings are not good. Stick to the drink menu here"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-04-30,2,weak ass tea and not enough bubbles. regret buying this. should have gotten kung fu tea.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-04-17,5,"Delicious bubble tea ! One of the best ones I've had. 
Also great vegi dumplings 
One problem - very small space and crowded. 
It's a bit of a wait for something simple , the stuff is nice - for a long wait they gave us extra dumplings 
Love VIVI bubble tea - they have few locations in the city 
We search for them anywhere we go ;)"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-04-15,4,"Cute and Small. Bubble tea is banging. Enough said.
Recommend: Coconut Milk Bubble Tea"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-04-05,2,"Weak tea, horrible service. 

They had a special promoting their ""Thai tea"" one day and I decided to give it a shot. I had been to this Vivi location a while back to get a regular milk tea (still weak) and I remembered it was mostly milk. The ""Thai tea"" basically tasted like soap and sugar. The coloring was also off (should be a medium to deep orange, not pale peach). I wish I could have tasted it before I paid for it - I took one sip and threw it out. 

While on line for this terrible tea, I was rudely cut by a girl who was friends with the cashier. They chatted in Mandarin for a few moments, before she placed her order. No acknowledgement from the cashier that she had cut the line whatsoever. When I asked for no ice (I have sensitive teeth), the cashier gave me a dirty look and shouted to the other employee who was preparing the tea. You don't need to understand Mandarin to know that she was talking sh-t... ""no ice"" does not equate to 15 seconds of snide commentary. 

Go to Coco!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-04-02,5,"This place is awesome! I love the red bean matcha with bubbles. I come here regularly, the staff (specially the two girls at the counter are always super nice) is efficient. Will be coming back!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-03-20,3,"I drink Yakult everyday. This is the first time I try mango yakult with tapioca. Very good. 
PS. this place only have 4 small tables. They do not have a restroom available for customer"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-03-20,3,"Great bubble tea, good is decent too. Prefer their ramen over sushi anytime though. Good service and pretty fast. A couple sits over there and good to study, hangout and catch up with friends or take out. Good for small groups or alone if staying there though."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-03-17,4,"Bubble tea is good.
Good cheap sushi.
Small cute space.
Good music.
QUIET staff! -1star"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-03-08,4,"I went to Vivi with my friend this past weekend because we were craving something good to drink and were a little hungry; bubble tea is always the answer in those situations!

The Flatiron location was somewhat small, like the other locations, but we were able to get a seat, which was fortunate because golly were they popular!  There was a constant line the entire time we were there.

I ordered a hot chocoberry cookie bubble tea and my friend got the basic black milk tea, hot, with bubbles and no sugar.  The black milk tea tasted great.  Mine was interesting, to say the least.  The flavor was good, but I wasn't expecting or didn't realize there would be cookie chunks in it that quickly became soggy.  It was tasty but a little weird.  The bubbles in both drinks were great; a little soft and delicious with a slight chew.

I had a relatively good experience here; what I drank was tasty.  The service was pretty good but I initially ordered a moo milk tea which apparently you cannot get hot, which I don't understand.  Anyway, 4 stars for good bubble tea and many options!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-02-28,5,"Good place for friends hangout and talking. I went with my long-time-no-see friends, good experience."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-02-25,4,"Solid boba tea place in NYC.  Good tea and lots of choices of drinks.  We tried the classic boba milk teas.  I enjoyed it.  One of the better ones in my extensive tour of boba tea places, but solid.  So many boba tea places now, must try them all...."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-01-22,4,"I haven't had bubble tea in years, so when my friend took me here, it was a nice surprise to find out I missed it.

-- BUBBLE TEA --
I'm not a huge fan of bubble tea, but I now enjoy it from time to time. Vivi offers a variety of bubble tea. There are ones with tapioca balls, some with red beans, some with plain ice, or even a slushy, all in a variety of flavors.

If you don't know what to get, it's a safe bet to pick from their Top 10 list--and do get one with ""bubbles"" (tapioca balls). I personally enjoy the taro milk or any of the milk options, with bubbles. The sweetness level for most of their teas is just right for me. If you want some something sweeter, just ask. 

-- SNACKS --
If bubble tea isn't for you, they also offer snacks to eat. These range from a variety of dumplings (pork/ pork and shrimp/ veggie), ramen (eel/ seafood/ beef), and sushi rolls. For the prices, they are a great value and sufficiently tasty.

-- AMBIANCE --
They do offer bar seating by the window and three tables for couples if you want to sit and eat. The place is styled very Korean kawaii in its decor.

-- REWARDS --
One of the reasons I come back here is that they have a rewards card. Buy ten bubble teas and get one free (doesn't apply to food). It's a good incentive to visit when I'm in the neighborhood.

-- SUMMARY --
Try Vivi and their bubble tea or food, they make good snack options."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2017-01-13,4,"The bubble tea is very good. 
I just wish it was a 1-2 and you're out, but they make it fresh and that's the best!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-12-12,5,"I have been to this shop quite a few times, and it never disappoints. They offer many different bubble teas and snacks. My favorite is the coconut bubble tea. It is a sweet tropical paradise, and it is my sweet retreat after a long day. They offer hot and cold bubble teas and the tapioca pearls are optional. They add or omit them according to your preference. The staff is young (mostly students) and they're pretty efficient. I usually get my order within minutes. The space is pretty small with seating for about 10 people. It is all white and modern, and it is typically clean. I have had informal business meetings here and I've met my friends here."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-10-25,5,"Awesome place, near PATH and 1 train; yummy Thai bubble tea! Delicious!

If you like Thai tea come here"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-09-24,5,"I always go there to order the Taro slush, that's great and the sever is good. I like it."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-09-09,3,"The place is cute, small.
The bubble tea is good and the tapioca still seems fresh.
The milk tea is perfect.
However the workers are a bit rude or loud."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-08-21,4,"This boba chain is decent if you know exactly what you want. Recently, I have been hooked on the grapefruit pulp tea w/ basil seeds and herbal jelly.

How this Vivi's is different than other locations in the chain:

* tax is charged

* accepts credit/debit cards

* more tables and chairs

* more food options (e.g., noodles)

* lacks Chinese homies loitering in front of the store"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-07-29,1,"This ViVi location is just about the worst bubble tea place you can order from! The staff are rude, unfriendly and slow! I saw the cashier handle garbage and proceed to handle food. After a lady ordered a California roll, they said they ran out of avocadoes and were very unapologetic about it. Bordering argumentative. They also speak very rudely about their customers in cantonese and mandarin. Avoid at all costs!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-07-20,2,"I LOVE bubble tea and ViVi Bubble Tea, was just okay. The staff weren't to friendly; however, they were really busy so maybe that factor played a part in their behavior. I ordered a standard milk tea with boba. They did not put a lot of boba in my drink, The boba was chewy and soft and the milk tea tasted good. I was going to sit down and enjoy my drink; however I noticed that one of their chairs had menstrual blood on the seat. Upon seeing that I was just ready to get my drink and go. Once again I love bubble tea; however out of all of the different tea shops in NYC I think this one is one of my lease favorites.  Note that they do have wifi. Their process are reasonable in-between $3 -$5, you can choose how sweet you want your drinks, they have snacks you can purchase. I am not sure if they have a bubble club or if they give discounts to students."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-07-12,3,"I've had better. Usually the taro milk tea is my go to and since I have taro at every single bubble tea joint I go to, I can compare apples to apples. Most taros are slightly sweeter-this one was just off the mark. The restaurant is very small and they didn't air condition the area properly leaving the door wide open on a hot day so we were sweating inside."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-07-10,4,"I feel weird reviewing this place since it's like so many other bubble tea places, but whatever. Basically it's a solid place to get bubble tea. The kids behind the counter are polite and pretty fast, and I've never had a wrong order. I can't speak for the food, but you're really going there for the bubbles, right? Right."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-07-05,2,The bubble tea here is simply basic. Enough to satisfy a craving but not worth dropping close to $5 for a large size. I had the jasmine honey and it was not a crazy sugary drink. My biggest issue is with the actual bubbles which were flavorless and mushy. No bueno. I definitely will not come back.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-07-04,5,"I write this at a really strange time of the night, where I ponder on the sadness of which I feel as I've slowly developed lactose intolerance...and can no longer have bubble tea normally without feeling pain afterwards. With that being said, this is probably my favorite vivi location for a number of reasons:

1. Proximity to workplace. Very Close. 
2. Efficiency of the girls working here. I get my drink very quickly.
3. Very good drinks all around. Quickly made.
4. Lazy lunch opportunities in the $5 sushi roll special. Sushi here is surprisingly pretty good for the standard. Try the salmon roll.

I usually order (now after my LI) a lychee iced tea with pudding no bubbles. Trust that pudding is greater than tapioca pearls."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-07-02,2,"This is the second time having Vivi's bbt and it's not too impressive. We got the standard - the black milk tea with tapioca. Tapioca were absolutely lovely - good flavor with a nice chew without being hard or anything of the sort. Ranks among my favorite tapioca in this city for sure. But the milk tea itself was EXTREMELY bland and watery, even though there weren't much ice in the drink in the first place. Will probably head elsewhere next time."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-07-01,4,"I've been to many bubble tea spots before and usually get the blended teas in the summertime. When I came here I ordered a passion tea slush with bobba and it was much thicker than any of the other teas I've had. After the tea had melted a bit it was much more enjoyable but the first sip was slimy almost. I did appreciate that they added more bubbles than I usually get. 
The size of the store isn't large so it's ideal for grab and go and less of a sit down. It was packed but the line moved really fast. Good for when you're in a rush."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-06-25,5,Quality bubble tea. The tapioca balls weren't too firm or too soft. I got a large mango bubble tea for less than $5. I definitely recommend this place.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-06-23,3,Got the Thai milk tea w classic boba. It was just ok. I love that they were easy on the ice but unfortunately I thought it was easy on flavor too. Maybe I'm biased because I had boba guys yesterday and was extremely impressed w that.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-06-14,3,"I come here from time to time because my job is nearby. I've had the Taro Milk tea and the Taro Slush and both were decent although the boba was a little on the bitter side. I haven't tried any of the food. 

I've always had quick service.

The bubble tea here is okay and I'll keep coming here but I still prefer Coco's or Kung Fu Tea."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-05-19,2,This place has a lot of mosquitos from Mexico. Me and my friends were spending more time hunting for the mosquitoes than drinking the bubble tea.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-04-30,3,"I definitely give this place points for not overloading the boba with ice. Like it was a legit fucking thai iced tea, strangely filling actually. 

That being said this place really isnt anything particularly special. I brought Diana cuz shed never tried boba before, and as most of us know, boba is the shit, but she was only mildly amused. 

Also, Boba is more of a social experience, and i looked around and this space really didnt have anybody chilling there. That was kind of weird. It just didnt click."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-04-22,3,"I've walked past this place many times and today I decided to try their taro bubble tea. I must say I was disappointed. The bubbles/boba was good but the taro wasn't great at all, it was too milky for me. I've had taro bubble tea many times at different places and this was probably my least favorite. 

The staff was friendly and quick, considering it was quite busy. I might go back here again just to try their sushi."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-04-17,3,"Vivi has your typical bubble tea options as well as things like Moo Milk (which appears to be Lactaid milk with toppings). I'm not sure why someone would spend $4 for a cup of Lactaid milk, but to each his own. My favorite here is the 3Q milk tea, which is your standard milk tea with boba, pudding, and grass jelly. Nothing mind blowing about this spot, but a good place to satisfy your boba cravings if you happen to be in the area.

Note: Drinks here are less sweet compared to those from other boba spots. I typically get 70% sugar at other places and that tasted like the 100% sugar here."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-04-17,3,"I ordered the typical Bubble Milk Black Tea. Sugar level is pretty good. No complaints.

The only thing I have to say about this place is it's really small. You confuse the line of people waiting for their drinks for the line to order. I know I did. It took me a minute to realize it myself, as did about every other person entering while I was waiting for my drink. 

Also, there is a female server who seems like she will bite your head off if you don't claim your drink within 2 seconds of her calling your number. Beware."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-04-13,4,I love this place. It's super cute. The staff is very friendly and I always order the peach ice jelly tea with gelatin balls. The tempura rolls are yummy and fresh. I especially like that they are extremely affordable. Drink and entree adds up to about $10. I'm not a big fan of the dumplings but they only offer steamed and I prefer fried. The mango slush is delicious as well :)
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-03-26,5,OMG I love this place the Passion fruit tea is so good with the tapioca in the bottom. The pork roast ramen noodles soup is also good with miso soup base. For the quality of the food is definitely a good price is very affordable.
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-03-12,5,"passed by this place yesterday ordered the taro bubble tea, it was made quite quickly even with a long line of people.
The tea was delicious and not too sweet just how i like it, the tapioca balls were really good and not like others that I've tried that are hard to chew and bitter.
The employees are nice and friendly.
Great bubble tea spot!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-03-05,3,"I tried Bubble Tea years ago and I didn't like it. So after walking past this place today I thought I would give it another try. I ordered the Passion Fruit QQ and also saw that they served Ramen. So I also ordered the Eel Ramen with Tonkotsu soup base. I will say this place changed my feelings on Bubble Tea. I really liked it. It wasn't too sweet, the bubbles weren't overwhelming. It was just right. The Ramen...compared to traditional Noodle Houses and other Ramen specialty restaurants  I would say this is the ""fast food"" version. I liked it, but I have had better. Let's just say it got the job done. Especially because it was only $7.50. I would definitely order it again though. I'll be back!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-03-01,5,I love bubble tea! So quick and lots of good flavors. Always consistent. I love Vivi!
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-02-16,3,"Conveniently located on 23rd street near the subway (number 1 train), Vivi Tea is like the fast food equivalent for bubble tea. Ordering here for the first time can be a little confusing. There are many options. When I asked how many calories were in the teas, they referred me to a chart with a range of numbers. ""Can't you just tell me how many calories are in there?"" I asked. They politely laughed & explained that it depends on how much sugar YOU decide to add. At Vivi Bubble Tea, you decide how much sugar goes into your drink. So if you want loads of calories, you increase the sweetness level. If not, omit the sugar. I had one (I tried the Honeydew) with just a little sugar & it was pretty good. It's a cute but small shop. For my main bubble tea fix, I'll still be headed downtown to Chinatown or better yet across the river to Tea & Milk."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-02-05,5,"Gooooooooooooood!
Very close to subway station! Yeah
So lucky that I can find bubble tea around my working place~"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-02-01,4,"Cute store, fast, and satisfying flavors. No doubt that there are better places for bubble tea, but this is the most convenient."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2016-01-27,3,Free bobas. Good price but I think they don't use very natural ingredients. My stomach hurt after I had Taro bubble tea since I mostly eat healthy food!
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2015-12-17,3,"My mind is blown.  The black tea that they use here and that I taste at so many other places is actually EARL GREY.  Say whaaaat?  Vivi is obviously a chain and they have a bajillion other locations elsewhere, but this one was close to my gym and at a convenient location in Chelsea so I quenched my thirst and my bubble tea craving and decided to pick up a cup of regular black milk bubble tea.  $3.81 including tax - I feel like I can get this stuff cheaper at other shops, albeit in Chinatown.  You pay for convenience.  Vivi is pretty much a monopoly in this part of town.

What blew my mind was the following:  I asked the cashier if they had oolong tea.  She had no idea what oolong tea was and had to ask someone.  Then I was like, oh, you guys have earl grey black tea (after seeing the sample of leaves on the counter and not knowing this was their standard) and she asked the other employee what earl grey was!  She thought it was a brand!  I mean, its not a real tea shop so I guess I shouldn't overreact for a tea place's staff not knowing a thing about tea.

The tea itself was actually quite delicious and not too sweet even though it was at full sugar levels.  What was really lacking was flavor in the tapioca.  It was literally just texture, nothing else.  Not soaked in honey and not the slightly bit of sweet.  Bummer.

Vivi is okay if you're absolutely craving bubble tea and can't get it anywhere else without getting on a train."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2015-12-14,1,"I have this a one star because I ordered  Cappuccino flavored bubble tea which tasted yuck! And they won't even change it. I tried the tea while still in the store, it was so strong. After taking a sip I asked if I can add a flavor to lighten up the strong taste, they refused, than as a dissatisfied customer I asked if I can change it, mind you still literally standing there! They still refused! I mean it's  just tea. I Should've stuck with taro, but whatever happened to customer service. I won't ever go back here because they're not very accommodating. High dissatisfied! So unless YOU DEFINITELY KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE, don't try anything new because they won't change it!"
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2015-12-14,2,"The tea itself isn't terrible, but the pearls are what put me off. It's fine at first, but unless you drink this in under 20 min the pearls get tough."
30,vivi-bubble-tea-new-york-3,2015-12-11,4,"Finally a boba place in NYC that doesn't have leftover or frozen boba from yesteryear. Other places to take note, it's really not that hard."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2019-12-18,5,we came here 2 times in our 3 day visit to Chelsea area. great place to start your day with a smoothie (all fresh) or bagel or both. Fast and friendly service.
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2019-11-26,5,"Hmm wasn't sure what to expect but made my way to Olympia to check out what kind of sandwiches this place is bangin out. Standard NYC deli feel and on the board, they have the standard sandwich combinations but I was looking for the ""chopped cheese"" sandwich that I saw online. Didn't see it anywhere, but I ordered it anyways and he knew right swaym asked me if I wanted lettuce tomato, everything on it? I said sure! Lol. 

Anyways I get this hot beautiful melty chopped cheese (it's essentially a cheesesteak with ground/pork beef mix) and devour this under $10 masterpiece. Value and quality is the way of life. Will be back again!"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2019-11-22,3,"I've been scouring Yelp for a spot in NYC that sells chopped cheese without me having to go all the way to Harlem. Olympia's Finest Deli was the only location I could find. So, my fiance and I ventured over to try it one evening. When we got there, I didn't see it on the menu. We were just going to leave but I decided to just ask if they had it anyway, and they did! It comes served on your choice of a hero or roll, and we went with the hero. It was my first chopped cheese, so I had nothing to compare it to - but I had imagined that it probably just tasted like a cross between a cheeseburger and a Philly cheesesteak. It pretty much met my expectations, except the bread was a bit stale. Maybe it would have been better on a roll, or maybe it was stale from being late in the day. Either way, I think I'll continue my search for a conveniently-located chopped cheese spot in the city. One day, I shall make it to Harlem."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2019-09-04,4,"Great staff and nice selection of items, and the smoothies are a real plus if you're trying to make good choices! However, if you're like me, you'd come here for the chopped cheese. I couldn't make it to Hajji's so I have no comparison, but this was 5 minutes from my hotel and the sandwich was legit. I came one night (almost before they closed) and got it on a roll and it was pretty good (no lettuce or tomato, just the basics), but I came back a couple of days later and got it on a hero and it was awesome (lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mayo)."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2019-07-11,5,"Some of the best smoothies to start my day, amazing breakfast sandwiches, and incredibly nice staff that'll put a smile on your face! Best Deli around!"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2019-07-01,5,"Love this place. Fresh, hot, reasonable, fast, friendly. If staying anywhere nearby, go get breakfast or lunch from a huge menu and take out. You will spend 1/3 of what you spend at sit down places. It's a store too and juice bar. Great breakfast sandwiches or plates."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2019-04-09,4,"We stayed in the Flatiron area for our trip and we were all craving chopped cheese sandwiches after seeing them on social media.  This was the only place in the area that had it so we decided to give it a try.  I now have a new item to add to my list of best hangover foods.  The ingredients inside a chopped cheese seem simple but they all meld together very well.  As an added bonus, this shop also has a bunch of fresh healthy smoothies to help wash it down."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2019-03-24,5,"One of the best chopped cheese in the area. This place makes it so good my friends and I came back 3 x. The combination of cheese, peppers and the thin toasted roll is amazing. Don't sleep on the smoothies. They are 100% fresh and made to order. Highly recommend this place if you want fresh chopped cheese and a refreshing juice to cleanse your body. The bacon and ham breakfast sandwiches on a gyro are a must order as well. Staff here is really friendly and don't expect a long wait for your food or beverages. Prices are reasonable and this location is kept very clean."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2018-10-18,5,"This is my go to lunch spot. Best chicken cutlet in Chelsea and their prices are great. They do a great $6 and change salad bowl, smoothies and juices and hot soups. Service is always quick and friendly! Thanks Olympia!"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2018-05-28,5,"This place has an excellent chopped cheese if you're looking for one in manhattan. It's off menu, but a foot long hero is like $7 and incredible."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2018-05-23,5,"This type of deli is what makes living in New York so amazing! Seriously delicious smoothies with a wonderful diversity of fresh ingredients available. I usually get a spinach, date, avocado, mango, cinnamon, and almond butter smoothie. Service is prompt and friendly.

Thanks guys!"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2018-04-12,5,"I'd like to give a shoutout to the Good Samaritan deli worker I witnessed in your established this afternoon. While waiting for my wrap, he said ""here Alex"" and slid a  coffee over to a homeless regular who wandered in. I'll never forget that. Sometimes you forget there's good people in this world. When I'm in the area again...I'll stop back in."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2018-02-20,5,Chicken Philly was to die for and I went back the next day for a chocolate cheesecake muffin.

31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2017-10-25,4,"After a late lunch of Dim Sum in the village and hanging out with dear friends,  we took a M55 bus back to the hotel and spotted this deli just across the street from our stop at 24th Street. 
Only 2 employees working at 8:30 pm but both greeted us warmly and were eager to help find what we wanted.
My wife and I decided we would share 1 of the 3 types of Tuna Salad on a Kaiser roll. This turned out to be a very good choice and was enjoyed in the comfort of our hotel room."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2016-12-13,4,Get a Bacon Egg and Cheese with salt and pepper on a role off a short order stove.  Good times.
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2016-11-30,5,I start every morning at Olympia Deli. The food is always good and the staff is super friendly. They remember my order and I always leave with a smile!
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2016-10-27,4,"Good food, great service. They're always on time with my delivery orders and are very friendly. Sometimes I can be picky about how I want a particular sandwich or smoothie, and they always manage to get it right."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2016-09-26,3,"If you don't want to spend $12 for one, this is your best option for a bargain made-to-order salad on this strip of 6th Avenue. While it comes with a bottle of water (nice!) but it's just OK since the beets have been undercooked and the chicken is meh."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2016-09-13,5,"This place is amazing! I mostly go there for my morning breakfast and the workers remembers what I like. The price is actually pretty cheap for a deli in Manhattan but mostly, the food is amazing!! :)"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2016-07-25,2,"The most tasteless, textureless sandwich I've ever tasted with bland service as a side.  Nothing was fresh, not even their attitude."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2016-04-20,5,"Very nice deli, great juices, selection, and prices. Highly recommended."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2016-03-09,5,"I go here for the green smoothies; that is all I've had here. The guy making them (I think I his name is Amin?) is so friendly, remembered me from the one other time I was in there and gave GREAT recommendations on ingredient combos for green smoothies (so good for you, but not always so tasty unless you know what you're doing and he does). His are the best I've had. And the girl at the cash register is so sweet. I just got back from the gym, so I am headed there now....... So excited!!"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2016-01-26,3,"This is mainly a bagel review:

Bagel - 2.50 (everything with veggie cream cheese).  Uninspiring bagel, standard amount of decent cream cheese, but decent price, admittedly.  Sure, compared to places like Brooklyn Bagel, etc., it's hard to measure up.  That being said, nothing jumped out at me that sets this place apart.  If I return and have an improved experience, I'll be sure to update this."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2016-01-07,5,"BEST DELI AROUND. They have become my first stop after getting off the PATH Train. The workers there do everything perfect. The sandwiches, coffee, natural fruit juices, and not to mention the oatmeal. The oatmeal is done perfectly to the point where you don't have to add a single thing, no fruits, no sugar. The consistency is perfect. Thick but not hard. The workers there are amazing as well. They make it worth my trip. I swear I've learned so much from sports with just hearing my juice guy go on and on about it. Definitely a deli to be loyal too. 

I just wish they were closer to my job for lunch. But to start my day with breakfast Olympia has my back!"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2015-09-25,1,"Almost every time we order breakfast from them for delivery, they mess up at least one of the orders, and then we still have to pay for it because we find out after the fact. How do you continually mess up orders? And then when we call back, they just say ""oh we'll make it up for you the next time you order."" Like you'll remember..."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2015-06-14,3,I don't think this is a 4-star Deli. It has everything you need for a quick stop but the rating is based on the sandwich. We ordered 2 bagels and neither of them were anything special. Fairly bland which shows they didn't use much seasoning. I've had better in Brooklyn and many other little deli's in the city.
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2015-05-27,5,"Great cheap juice bar and deli with friendly service and prices, too!"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2015-04-09,5,The best place to get a fresh juice! $5.99 for a 24oz unlimited items. The employs are always really nice as well.
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2015-01-13,4,"Amazing smoothies that aren't as expensive as some of the other smoothie places.

Summer Slam tastes like pb&j in a cup :)"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2015-01-09,4,Place is great. Nice guys running it. Get their chicken cutlet and spicy chicken cutlet sandwich every week and it's awesome.
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2014-12-10,5,"consistently reliable delivery, good pricing, and good sandwiches...the juice could better, but Olympia is still the best deli in the area"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2014-12-02,5,"BEST deli around Chelsea

Friendly attentive staff, quality meats etc for sandwiches and really good prices.  

Salads are $6.99 for 5 topping plus a meat...you cannot beat that deal.

Plus a juice bar. Great spot for lunch all around."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2014-10-11,5,"Super nice and efficient staff, know their regulars and treat them well.  Very tasty egg sandwiches.  My go-to deli in the area."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2014-09-15,1,"If you are interested in purchasing a sandwich, go anywhere else!  Went in for lunch today and saw $5.50 for sandwich, $6.50 for hero.  Super reasonable for Chelsea.  I ordered a cold roast beef hero with cheddar, lettuce, tomato and mustard. But when i get up to the register, my bill comes to $8.17!  When I inquire as to why, the man behind the counter (who claimed to be the manager) tells me that the prices listed on the board are for ""meat only"" and that cheese, lettuce and tomato are extra.  Enough said."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2014-07-20,5,"A quick search for a pack of gum leads to another SCORE for juice fiends!  A great menu with a variety of juice concoctions, no stink eye if you decide to make up your own, and a mountain of fresh produce to make any veggie head spin with delight.  And best, only five fitty for a large!"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2014-05-11,3,"A deli on Sixth Avenue, but certainly no Gold metal in Olympic fashion.

Small deli that offers sandwiches by name:  The Titanic, The Amtrack Express, The New Yorker, The Prince, Im Hungry, The Chelsea Antigue, New York Cutlet, et al.  Numerous gross spelling errors and punctuation in their printed menu as ""Cordon Blue Hero"" when it is Chicken Cordon Bleu, a Switzerland concoction and ""Im Hungry"" for I'm Hungry.

Breakfast calls for one banana and one water bottle totaling $2.25.  Price is reasonable for Chelsea location.  The cashier calls me ""Mamma"" and ""honey"" rather than the standard respectable, and always preferred, ""Ms."" which is not a winning metal for a return visit."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2013-11-20,5,"Hands down, the best coffee in the city.  Also make really nice smoothies and fresh veggie juice.  It has a nice little array of packaged foods and snacks to buy and a great selection from the deli.  The service is great.  I love them all. Great prices."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2013-10-19,5,"This is a review for their fresh made juice.  They make any combo you want and it is inexpensive, just $5.  Plus, everyone who works there has always been very friendly every time I've been there.  Yay!!"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2013-08-22,4,Olympia's juice bar is pretty legit ; there is no need to spend a lot of money on juices when you can get a good one here. They also have great coffee. Salads are good too. I go to Olympia every morning.
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2013-08-16,4,"I love this place! It's a simple humble deli but don't be fooled. The staff is friendly and accommodating and the food is yummy. Best of all, the prices are excellent. I love the custom salad for $5.99(including tax) with 5 toppings. The selection of toppings is pretty extensive (try the mango in your salad, it's awesome!) and they chop by request. I've also tried the paninis and they are yummy and affordable as well. I might even try a smoothie. They also have a very reasonable credit card minimum ($5.50). Go!"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2013-08-05,4,"I am here most of the time for breakfast! my order is always sausage egg and cheese on a roll with hot sauce. (fried-eggs) and they make it good!
Plus for breakfast time, you get a free small hot coffee and they really make the coffee really good.

Their Juices are really good as well. 
Salad have great selection/toppings to choose with so many kind of dressings!

I had their Fried Fish Sandwich for lunch and it comes with a free can of soda. Delicious!

The Titanic is a name they call for lox on a bagel with cream cheese and lettuce and such. Or you can have it on a roll. They are flexible.

They have veggie cream cheese and scallion cream cheese which are both amazingly good. I like the scallion more though for your bagel and cream cheese. These are 25cents more than the regular bagel with cream cheese."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2013-07-18,5,"Get the JUICE!  I get veggie juice here every week, sometimes 5 days/week.  It's amazing how many veggies get crammed into that cup...it's like 4 salads worth, without all the annoying chewing and fatty dressing.  My favorite is Carrotts, Kale, Cucumber, Beets, Ginger & Chocolate Protein.  Sounds gross, but Yum!!!  And suuuuper healthy, it will make you more agile than a subway rat and faster than a cop through a red light, guaranteed!  I love it. I love it love it love it!  Once Fairway opens across the street, it will be the only block I need to survive in midtown.  Hooray juice!!!

Oh, and the credit card minimum is $5, which means you don;t need cash for the juice.   Hip Hip Hooray Juice!"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2013-02-07,4,I get my juice from here :) and it's definitely less pricey than the other juice places I've tried... also better quality ingredients.
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2012-12-21,4,"The sandwiches are good and come with a soda. Just your regular, average, nuts-and-bolts New York City deli. My heart breaks as they attempt to compete with the $1 pizza place on one side and the gourmet lunch place on the other. Both are popular with two different crowds."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2012-08-22,4,"This place is legit.

Delish fresh customizable juice and smoothies, not bulked up with fillers (like Natureworks, ick!). Good deli selection, great prices.

Only downside is that you might have to wait behind a line of people getting iced coffee. Apparently it's a hit.

Cheers~"
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2011-09-15,4,"I decided, like an idiot, to go on a juice fast: only fresh-squeezed fruit and vegetable juice for a week. So I needed a nearby juice bar that could hook it up. Almost every deli in this area advertises a juice bar, but they're mostly full of sh*t: they'll have pre-packed juices, or a smoothie bar only, or they'll make you smoothies all souped up with frozen yogurt and shizz, or they'll have only a tiny selection of produce to choose from. Even the fresh juice carts mess it up: they only juice veggies and blend the fruit, so you're still getting all the pulp from the fruit (which, don't get me wrong, is usually awesome - just not when you're in the midst of some freaky hippie shizz that dictates only juice).

ANYWAY. Olympia Deli saved my life. Their juice bar has a giant selection of fresh fruits and veggies, their juicer is friggin' hardcore and those guys will juice anything: peaches, cabbage, tomatoes, you name it. Plus they're friendly and their prices are reasonable, and my co-worker who still eats solid food like a normal person claims they have the best egg salad in the neighborhood. Oh man, just thinking about egg salad is making me drool! It must be juice time again..."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2011-08-19,4,"came here because corner cafe was really packed. ordered a bagel. i normally order mini's from corner cafe because a large bagel there always runs me about $5. a large everything bagel, toasted with lox spread cost me $2.50. a mini bagel from the corner cafe the exact same way costs about $2.50...

you do the math."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2010-01-19,4,"Really delicious chicken soup with bay leaves, peas, carrots, corn, and perfectly souped-up spaghetti.  $3.00 for the large... not a bad deal!  Compared to what I've seen elsewhere (ahem Broadway Cafe).

Friendly service, clean, organized... might be my new go-to spot for lunch."
31,olympias-finest-deli-new-york-5,2009-08-21,4,"really?  no reviews yet?  I headed here in desperation one day for a bagel.  I'm so glad I did.  The staff are really friendly, no gruff deli guys here!, the bagel was fresh and delicious with way too much cream cheese, just what you expect!  I saw that they had a clean and cheap salad bar so I came back the next week for lunch.  Yum!  So cheap ($5.50 for any 5 items!) and everything is kept very clean and fresh.  I'll be back for sure!"
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2020-02-28,1,"I literally order a coffee here every morning. I went in for an afternoon pick me up. I waited in line patiently, when it was my turn the guy at the register took the guy behind me stating he was a regular. I stated I was waiting and he just continued to ignore me because I wasn't a regular. WELL THIS REGULAR WILL NOT BE GOING THERE ANYMORE! Hope it was worth it!"
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2020-01-21,1,New location. Nice and clean. The coffee prices are marked up to pay the new rent. Very slow and the workers are pretty inept.
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2019-11-11,1,Incredibly rude staff I'm certainly never going back there. I recommend the Starbucks across the street..
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2019-06-17,5,EXCELLENT SERVICE!  Great consistent coffee!  Clean.  Fresh food!  Best DD in area for sure!
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2018-09-13,1,"Awful- I know this is a Kosher restaurant, so fine I stay away from the fake news meat, but they should make it a bit more clear- all fake news meat is in small print... they should not be deceiving, make it clear guys.
The worst? coffee has been watery the two times i've been there and today, i ordered a toasted bagel with cream cheese- bagel had grill burn marks but was cold...  how do you screw that up!?!?!?!?!"
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2018-06-12,1,"New morning crew a disaster today, lines out the door, bad attitudes, bad service...... MIKE WAKE  UP"
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2018-05-10,1,Went there on a Thursday morning really hungry because I had skipped out on food and home and the cashier tells me their machines don't accept my debit card. I had no cash with me and I usually pay with card at other places for small amounts without any problems. First time this has happened and the cashier wasn't even apologetic. Not happy.
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2017-12-26,5,"I walked in here, literally i had a couple of minutes to catch my bus and there were 9 people ahead of me. They took everybody's order prepared and served. I walked out in no time. Great service!!!"
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2017-10-27,1,"Worst Dunkin Donuts I've ever been too. Coffee is made watery and taste nasty. They do not serve meat!! I went in earlier to get the 2 for $5 Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Croissant and the bacon was DISGUSTING. It was really red and soggy. I asked the lady wtf is this and she said it's ""fake meat"". That DD does not serve real meat. WHAT THE HELL. What kind of franchise has the audacity to serve fake meat and call it bacon?

Never again coming here."
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2017-09-20,1,"Avoid at all costs! asked for a black caramel hot coffee. Got a hot black sugar free caramel coffee.  Returned it. Server then handed me a hot caramel  coffee with milk and sugar. $2.07 down the drain.  Is it that hard? You work at a coffee shop.
The service is terrible. Never get it correct the first few times.
Go away........... there are DD on every corner.  I give up!"
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2017-09-04,5,"Changing my review to 5 stars 
Riya is the best and professional 
I guess i should come only on the weekdays bot on weekends 
Good and bad !!
I really wanted ti change my 1 star to better rating . 
But i guess Sunday is not the best day to come . Not many people understand  simple english . Make sure you get what you ordered  because the lady who works on weekends can mess it up lol, but guy came and did it exactly the way i like it.   
I will change it to 3 stars  because some of the workers are great , some are worthless 
Sorry dd on 34 but i think you should keep those smart one full time"
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2017-08-22,2,"I am not happy with the service at this DD, I would go there almost every morning since I started my new job (its right around the corner) and I kid you not they have gotten my order wrong every single time. I even went on the TO-GO-APP and placed my order once thinking maybe if they read what I'm asking for they'll finally get it right....NOPE I was wrong once again even with my order printed on paper it was wrong and I don't get anything fancy all I get is TEA and when I tell them this rude girl telling me that I have to join the line. Dunkin' needs to train their staff on costumer service or just hire people that can read and speak English!!!"
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2017-07-20,5,"This place rocks!!  They are the friendliest, quick and professional. On several occasions, through my own fault, I spilled my drinks about a half block away. When I went back to purchase another they figured out what happened and said ""no charge"". This is the perfect example of great customer service. They have me for life. Highly recommended."
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2017-07-14,5,"I've been going there for years. They have great donuts and frozen drinks. They have smoothies, frozen coffees, this vanilla chai drink, etc that are all delicious."
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2017-04-15,1,They mean I got coffee they didn't let me use bathroom. And they curse me. Never go back again.
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2017-03-06,3,while going to grab the 6 train nearby to go to the city hall area i notice this dd has a baskin robbins so on my return trip back i will pick up a few prepacked baskin robbins ice cream for my coworkers cause it's friday and i am in the mood for pralines n cream. it's a spacious dd with tables and chairs to sit and i notice the kosher signs outside and inside for the religious types. the full dd menu and the donut display looks well stocked on a friday morning .open 24/7 so i can only assume the types that stumble in during the witching hours but overall not a bad dd and one of the more spacious ones in the area.
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2016-11-27,2,"I am not happy with their service because whenever  I went there the boys  are not served good service they are just want to finished their work and doing very hurry in everything. I ordered hash browns and tell them to make double toasted but they didn't did that, even there is no rush that time and it's for more than 2 times with me."
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2016-11-06,2,I am sorry but you can't have 2000 sq.ft of location off of 34th street and not to have a bathroom for customers! Maybe I am expecting too much but bathroom is expected for a coffee shop with 24 seats!!!!
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2016-04-07,1,"By far the worst customer service and product on the planet! Went here after learning that Cold Stone Creamery has shut down. Dunkin Donuts as a brand should be appalled that this store front is apart of their portfolio. Beyond rude and unnecessarily unfriendly. Would never return, as much as I'm a fan of the brand."
32,dunkin-new-york-95,2016-01-21,1,"(Would give 0 stars if possible)
9/10 times they get my order wrong even though I came many times and the same people took my order. 
Garbage."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2020-02-18,2,"They gave me a sausage on my beyond meat sandwich which, because I was starving, I only noticed a few bites in. I'm not a militant vegetarian but there were a million other places where I could have paid less for meat on my sandwich if I wanted the porky cholesterol. The person working the order delivery seemed overwhelmed and not very courteous. They kept someone in front of me with an online order waiting with the order up on the rack, and then delivered an incomplete order which he only noticed on the way out the door. The capper was that a member of the prep staff dropped a piece of bacon on the floor, went to pick it up, and then kicked it under the stove when she noticed me watching. I wonder where that was going. Anyway, this was my first time there, and it's right around the corner from my work but I won't be back."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2020-01-14,1,"Why do you guys always charge for butter but never put it on?

You've stolen a total of 10 dollars from me in the last three days

Fix yourselves!"
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2019-03-05,2,"Hate leaving bad reviews, but two days in a row I've had sub par experiences with this location. Yesterday I ordered a coffee with milk and sugar and the sugar was just sitting at the bottom. Not stirred in or anything. Today I asked for the thin mint cappuccino and was told they don't have that, there's no such thing. They told me this as I was staring right at it on the menu. It almost seemed like they didn't want to make it and instead offered me an iced coffee. Considering that it's 32 degrees outside, I said no and left. There's a bunch of other Dunkins in the area that I'll be going to from now on."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2017-08-20,1,"Horrible experience, at this location, Don't come to this dunkin donuts came here, I had to repeat my order 2 times, the people cannot speak English and just laugh at you in their own language, they still did not listen to my order and made wrong drink. they don't know What they are doing. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2017-06-29,3,"Second visit here within two days and the service is rough. They struggle to keep up with more than three orders at a time and accuracy is big area of opportunity for this Dunkin Donuts team. My order was wrong and it took a long time for the crew to complete my order. I noticed several other people who ordered after me received their drinks before me. Most of the drinks they were handing to customers (including my own) were messy and dripping from the sides. No one wants to hold a sticky dripping cup Dunkin. Overall not one my favorite Dunkin locations. Now I remember why I stopped coming to this spot. I will come back at a later date and see if anything has changed and hopefully it will be for the better. 

Side note: the staff was friendly."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2017-03-01,3,its ok dunkin donuts. its close to Madison square garden its a little smaller than the usual dunkin donuts but the service was not bad i got in and went right out. if you want to get a quick Coffee this is a cool spot to go to.. even though starbucks is across the street but i will go with the cheaper route haha.
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2016-10-06,5,"Great service. It is very busy of course in the morning, but the Manager Kareem has everything in order. The entire staff is on point with whatever system they created to keep service quick yet friendly. Unfortunately you always  get those few people who gather into a corner to text or read emails and watch shows instead of getting out of the way of other customers who are actually waiting for drinks/food. 
Anyhow, good job to this location!"
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2016-09-27,1,"Horrible. I don't know why I keep coming back here after get bad service time after time. Today, I have to ask myself whats wrong with me?! I really cant help it since it's right across from work! But I think that's it, goodbye!! I rather walk to 33rd or 5th ave locations for my dd fix next time! The staff are the rudest!"
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2016-04-11,3,"Not bad. Lots of grumpy New Yorkers in the morning, but nothing you can do about that."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2016-02-17,5,"I love this Dunkin, Always Great Service and the people who work there are Fabulous, great smiles and helpful.  I have been to many around the area and this is my favorite place and I will go out of my way just to get my coffee here.  They always make my morning with Great Coffee and Service and One needs that in a place we call NYC where people are always in a rush and no one has manners anymore.

If you are looking for Great Service and Great Coffee then go here.  I Highly Recommend."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2015-11-15,5,I love there coffee it's so good the five stars are for the coffee that's it. I need my coffee in the morning to wake me up or I can't function through the day. Excellent coffee
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2015-08-14,3,"I usuallly visit this location in the morning, which has friendly and efficient staff.  BUT today i happened to go in the afternoon around 6:30pm for a ""frozen dunkachino"".  After specifying NO whipped cream, turns out the old male staff member added whipped cream at the bottom of the cup!?!? Very decieving!!"
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2015-07-30,1,"I ordered 100 muchkins and a coffee.  They called my name after a few minutes and handed me a giant bag and a coffee.  I walked to work, opened up the bag, and it was filled with about 500 napkins.  Great job!  PS. And there are two phone numbers listed for them but nobody answers either one."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2015-06-05,1,"June 5. National Donut Day. Signs plastered everywhere on the windows of this Dunkin Donuts ""free donut with the purchase of any beverage."" I was getting coffee anyway, so I thought 'why not?' I ordered my coffee and donut. The cashier rang up my order and charged me for the donut. I asked her if it was still National Donut Day and she snapped back that I had to 'ask for the donut to be free!'
I told her to please adjust my total, which sent her off screaming something in Hindi to her presumable manager who punched some buttons on the register in honor of National Donut Day! 
The punch line of this whole story is that the donut was not what I had asked for! 
As I sipped my coffee I debated trying to get the flavor donut I requested but then decided this nonsense was not worth my time as I watched no less than five individual customers being hassled for not asking for the free donut! 
I overheard the manager explaining to a non english speaking customer that the Free Donuts were only free if you ""asked for the free donut"" and ""NO you are not getting a refund for the free donut"" he said very loudly to her. 
This is really unsavory behavior on behalf of this shady crew running this DD franchise. I guess they can get away with treating customers routinely rude because of their high volume tourist-centric location. Totally ruined my feel good National Donut Day buzz. Never again will I set foot in this DD when there are so many other locations to try. You have been warned!"
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2015-04-16,1,"WORSTTTTT place ever, Unfortunately its right by my job had to go get some coffee. The 2 indian lady that works there both has nasty ass attitude. i believe one of them is a mgr."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2014-10-28,3,This Dunkin sold whole coffee cakes - first time I had ever seen that.  Was great after midnight for a snack to eat on the train!
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2014-10-21,1,"Rudest @dunkindonuts ever

I love Dunkin Donuts. But unfortunately due to the franchises, you do not always get the same great service that you are used to as your local DD. However this one goes down in the book with the rudest service ever."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2014-10-15,1,"Id like to first highlight one of the individuals that works here: his name is Shan and he was very kind and has great customer service. Conversely, an employee named Salma could not have been more rude. I was purchasing k cups and the price of the k cups were on the box; she refused to honor the price that was listed on the box. She furthermore decided to say that customers shouldn't always get what they want and said she didn't care if she was fired. She was insulting and inappropriate and should not be working in the business of customer service. I was blown away by the lack of professionalism and service she maintained."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2014-05-15,2,I should've known better than to get a donut close to closing time but then again if your whole store is about selling donuts is it too crazy to want a decent donut that's not stale?
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2014-02-05,5,"Love this place, especially the servers.  Not an abundance of seating, but if you're looking for some good coffee served by friendly people, you can't go wrong with this place."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2013-05-02,2,"Small location across street from Penn Station. Only a few spots to sit at by front window to people watch the freaks walk by. Good coffee, but crappy donuts, as usual. I tried the the butter pecan iced coffee and did like it. Basically a grab and go spot. Open 5:30am-11pm.

Eh, there are like a million of these DD's spots in the city area and this one is nothing special."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2013-03-15,5,"What is there to rate about Double D's except staff and service.

I have been going here since they opened in the area a few years back.

Friendly staff. 

Service with a smile."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2012-09-30,3,i've come to this location a few times. most of the experiences have been good but the past 2 times was just bad. it took forever to get my stuff and people behind me got their food before me. what the?! and they gave me the wrong order too! ugh. i guess i won't be coming back unless i need a quick breakfast/donut fix.
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2012-09-13,1,"First of all, let me say I love Dunkin Donuts but I will never return to this location.  After standing in line a few minutes, the cashiers eagerly welcomed the man who came in right after me.  They had a full stock of croissants and all I wanted was a plain one but apparently the man behind me was oh-so-much more important.  He ordered every single one of them and I got the 'oh sorry, we're out' speech.  Like who the heck is this guy and why can't they spare one measly croissant when I was before him in line.  Luckily nobody was trying to come in when I stormed out or I might have run them over.  It was all I could do not to say F you.  I'll go to the one in Penn Station instead - this kind of service is unacceptable."
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2011-06-26,4,Had my first DD experience in NYC. I actually enjoyed the coffee! Very smooth and creamy just as I like it. The donuts were different. Very sweet and cake like instead of light and airy. Donuts were too sweet for my liking but what do you expect from a donut shop! An A okay for the donuts but enjoyed the coffee very much!
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2011-03-01,5,"This is my Dunkin! Close to my job. The staff is very friendly and the quality is always consistent. The line moves very quickly in the morning for people on their way to work. It's right next to the Affinia Hotel and outside Penn Station so there is always a lot of touristy foot traffic. There is very limited seating, just a bar with stools in front of the window that can fit 5-6 people. This D&D is for people who want to be in and out. Great staff!"
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2011-01-05,2,I love their drip coffee that you can buy in the grocery stores in Cali! Apparently though it is a mistake to order espresso drinks as they taste like crap! I couldn't even finish it! Thankfully there is a Starbucks on every corner and I have plenty of gift cards from xmas! Save your DD trip for when you actually want donuts!
33,dunkin-new-york-71,2010-12-22,4,"How can you go wrong? Efficient service, a hot coffee and a window seat is exactly what I need at 6:30 in the morning. It's also one of the only Dunkin' Donuts near Penn Station, after all the DDs in Penn were converted to Tim Horton's establishments. Ugh!"
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2020-01-20,4,Nice staff! Came by to get an iced caramel coffee and donut for national donut day. It was a good experience.
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2019-08-23,5,Maybe I've been lucky but this place has always gotten my order right. They're pretty clean and the drinks are always great. The location looks great and the drinks on tap are pretty cool.
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2019-07-13,3,"I had high hopes for Dunkin donuts because I'm from seattle and we don't have dunkins here. 

I came here at 9:30am and ordered an original glazed donut and a mocha. Maybe it's just this location but I was not impressed. The donut was sad-looking and some of the glaze had melted. Taste was only mediocre and was cakey. Mocha was just bland with no depth. It also tasted a bit watery. 

I did really appreciate the convenient charging stations and outlets by all (if not, almost) the seats."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2019-06-23,3,"Nostalgia keeps me coming back, since this was such a treat as a kid.  Obviously more mass produced when contrasted against the artisanal (and pricey) doughnut shops of today.  Not sure I'd be a repeat customer if I didn't have such fond memories TBH.

Boston Kreme: Still my favorite.  The chocolate ganache on top is a bit messy and not amazing.  But the custard inside is like a pudding dessert and always in a generous portion.

Strawberry Frosted: A relatively lighter donut since there is no filling and the dough base is fluffy.  The strawberry frosting looks cool, but is so obviously artificially flavored and artificially colored.  Kinda remember this one tasting better when I was a kid.

Blueberry Glazed: A hearty donut, with a more cakey dough.  The blueberries remind me of the small and over dried ones you find in oatmeal packets, quite unlike a juicy blueberry muffin.  Pairs well with the coffee.

Coffee: Solid.  A good value since it's quite reasonably priced (and in a large size) compared to fancier options around town."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2019-05-08,1,Omg so horrible. They literally are so incompetent; they don't listen to what you're asking for and just rush you along!!!!!! Messed up my order THREE times; all I asked for was an ICED LATTE WITHOUT SUGAR BUT WITH A TINY BIT OF CARAMEL DRIZZLE and AFTER 3 times you still didn't get it right!!!!! I gave up and threw it out. Will never come back; this is the WORST DUNKIN DONUTS!!!!!!!!!
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2019-02-20,1,Probably the worst donut holes I've tried! Came in about 9:30 pm and they had only like 6 donuts left and the donut holes tasted really old and hard
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2019-01-18,1,"I went there and ordered an egg & cheese croissant with a medium coffee w/ milk & sugar. The coffee didn't take long and it tasted good. The egg & cheese croissant, on the other hand...

The employees basically seemed shocked that I'd ordered anything in addition to the coffee. For reasons I do not understand, I was offered a second coffee. I hadn't even taken two sips of the coffee I'd previously received, so I declined the offer. I waited as other people around me received their orders, and eventually asked if order #895 was going to be ready any time soon. The employee that I asked saw that I had a coffee and asked to see my receipt. I showed him my receipt, and he saw that there was a croissant on it. So I got a croissant. By itself. Despite having paid for an egg & cheese croissant.

I almost gave this place two stars because I got a donut at this place without any incident, but nah. I won't be going back here. There are significantly better breakfast options in the area for basically the same price."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2018-10-01,3,"So a little birdie told me about this one...

Recently renovated about one month ago, streamlining and getting rid of the Baskin Robbins that used to be located here. They are trying to promote that Nitro cold brew that I've become quite fond of. Truthfully, it's very watered down. Just didn't do it for me. If you work in the Times Square area or meeting up with someone that does, its an ok DD. 

The good... 

Charging stations for your phone located on a few of the hightop tables.Plus a few pads for cordless charging if you have the time to do so. Never seen either at a Dunkin before. Located just a few blocks from the Port Authority bus terminal. 

Just stick with the standards. Please don't try to be Starbucks. Pretty quick service. All the cold beverages are served out of taps. Which definitely speeds up your grab and go."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2018-06-19,5,"I come to this Dunkin Donuts just about every weekday.  They have become increasingly busy, as I walked in this morning and the line was nearly out the door but they get you in and out very quickly.  Albeit, once you order, they are already calling for the next person in line to step down when you haven't even paid yet and sometimes take their order, it is quite annoying but they always get it right for me.

The manager and most of the cashiers already know what I'm going to order once they see me, the manager even goes as far as to making my morning coffee by the time I'm at the register.  I usually get a breakfast sandwich and the guy who makes it already knows it's for me so whenever he's done and sees me, he doesn't even call out the order number, he just hands it to me and tells me to have a great day.  They're all very nice people which is why I frequent it as often as I do."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2018-03-13,5,"This location is very convenient next to the train! they are very helpful and friendly! Even though there is always a huge line they manage to finish it up really fast and accurately!!! they are always waiting for you with a warm Good Morning and a big smile, how lovely is to feel welcomed in this store!!! I just love each and one of these girls!!! Thanks Again!"
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2018-02-11,5,"Good ole DD! When you need a breakfast sandwich quick, DD will do the trick! And, if you are in the mood for ice cream, there is a Baskin Robbins in here as well!"
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2017-10-19,2,"The stars are for the convenient location and the nice cashiers. 

I come to this location often around 8am before work. It's usually busy but they move it along quickly. The line isn't really set up well and I often have to squeeze past people to get to a cashier. 

They've only forgotten to make my drink once out of the many times I've been there so I can't complain about that. Unfortunately I've had to throw out my French cruller donuts on 2 or 3 occasions because they tasted awful (like somehow they weren't cooked on the inside). I don't buy them at this location anymore. 

Today there was a man in this store aggressively asking for people to buy him food. I told the cashier and she said not to buy him food (I wasn't going to) and that he's there all the time and always bothers people. If this happens all the time, why doesn't he get kicked out?? I think the issue is that there's 0 management presence. The women in this store work really hard and are good people, but they're clearly not equipped to deal with larger issues like someone harassing customers."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2017-10-08,1,"Utterly ridiculous. Pressed for time I came in and asked for a plain bagel with CREAM CHEESE. I paid for a plain bagel with CREAM CHEESE. So I waited and heard ""plain bagel toasted with cream cheese!"" Got my order and went across to class. I get to class hungry as I don't know what ready to bite into my bagel with CREAM CHEESE. I open the bag to find a plain bagel toasted WITH NO CREAM CHEESE. AND it was thrown in the bag ad disheveled. I calmly went right across the street to get what I paid for. This is not the first issue I've had at this establishment. No more."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2017-07-30,1,This Baskin / Dunkin location was ridiculous! Closed before 9:30 PM on a Saturday when online and door said 11 PM. Went back Sunday and asked for a THICK shake (which had to be repeated 3x) and the one she gave me was like soup! Asked her to remake it and it came out the exact same! What's even more annoying was that she was annoyed at us because she couldn't do it right! Not going back and don't recommend going to this one. So ridiculous!
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2017-07-17,1,"I don't usually leave reviews unless if a place is SUPER wonderful or SUPER terrible.
I'm used to getting a hit or miss with DD locations depending on who's on shift so I don't usually make it that big of a deal... but I expected SOOOO much more from a MANHATTAN DD... This is definitely SUPER TERRIBLE!

Cashier was busy talking among themselves between orders at 11am - when a lot of people are still waiting on line for their orders. When it was time to take my order, she asked me what I wanted and I started telling her my order clearly so she doesn't mess it up. What does she end up doing? Totally ignoring me and started talking to her colleague. 
See, I give people the benefit of the doubt - I gave her a chance to see the whole order's end result before I start raging. So I waited till when she was ready, I told her my order again clearly and slowly making sure she got everything in her system. 

1- She messed up my simple SMALL ICED LIGHT & SWEET COFFEE + HAZELNUT. I told her exactly ""small light & sweet iced coffee with cream and hazelnut"" What did she gave me? A small iced coffee with little cream and extra sugar all piled up on the bottom. Applause for remembering my hazelnut? Coffee influences majority of my day at work... Thanks for messing that up. Maybe you should UP your barista skills instead of just tossing everything in a cup and calling it coffee. I did tell you HOW I wanted my coffee for a reason.

2- I was starving so I ordered my usual Sausage Egg & Cheese on english muffin with order of hashbrown on the side. I thought this would be a very generic order... for breakfast... no?
My sandwich looked like it was juggled around in a circus before landing in my to go bag. PLUS they didnt take my order of hashbrown? LADY. I even gave you the benefit of the doubt. How can you forget to take my order of hashbrown even when I repeated my order to you not once but TWICE?

Lesson learned for me.
Never expect anything more just because they're in Manhattan. I've gotten 10x better service from all other boroughs in New York. Just because it's in Manhattan... in a CROWDED HIGH POPULATION area... they still don't care enough to train their workers to be professional.

No more having food tossed at me from this place even if I need to starve.
You had one f'ing job. I'll no longer be paying for it.

An hour of stirring my coffee to have the sugar mixed - I'm STILL chugging chunks of sugar through my straw..."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2017-04-13,3,"An affordable place to avoid life. For example, maybe Barbara from accounting is on your back about filing pointless paperwork. Or perhaps your apartment is infested with cockroaches and you can't bring yourself to go home. Or worse, maybe your parents are visiting and have turned your apartment into your own personal hell. Whatever's going on, for less than $2 you can enjoy a donut and sit there for hours, avoiding all your problems. If you have $10, you can eat your feelings with a box of 50 donut holes. They also offer holiday themed donuts so you can still be festive without the drama of going home for the holidays. 

America runs on dunkins... because eating your feelings is easier than facing your problems."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2017-01-14,1,"After going there a few times.  Their dd app never works.   So after waiting on line for ten minutes,  the worker treated me with great disrespect because I only had money on my dd app.  So instead of giving me a coffee,  being I had money on the app,  but their machine was down,  again......they pushed me aside and ignored me when asked to speak to a manager ...  why have an application for your store,  and never have your computers able to accept the app....  it's not my fault,   I was ready to spend money...   so I believe they should have at least offered me a free coffee,   not push me to the side and ignore my demand to speak to a manager...  I wouldn't recommend anybody use this dunkin donuts location...."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2016-07-09,1,Horrible 4 woman couldn't run 1 cashier and a line building because they couldn't make change or think to apologize for the delay ! I left not worth it!
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2016-03-01,1,"I had to repeat myself about 3 different times to the guy making my milkshake and even then, he still didn't understand what I was saying. His work performance here made it seem as if it was his first day on the job. Overall, I'd say avoid this place at all costs. The venue is dirty and as other Yelpers stated, the employees here are flat out rude. Worst of all, I believe I got ripped off because my milkshake was in a small Dunkin Donuts cup instead of a Baskin Robbins cup. There is a price difference believe me. And I was charged $5 for it."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2015-10-28,1,This place is always dirty tables not clean staff always talking to eachother on their cell phones when they could be cleaning this place up its sad im a dunkin donut addict but it gets me mad to see such nice place look like a dump
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2015-07-04,1,"So I got a smoothie and it tasted rank, I would say sour yogurt taste. I took one sip and said Hohhot hell no. I was going to get something else instead but the front counter guy as I handed back to him said""we make it same every time"" and handed back to me.... I then just stated I just take my money back.... They definitely didn't want to do that... After five minutes of me just standing there they finally decided to make me whole and give me back my money.... Well 229 is not 429... And as they tried to throw away my receipt I caught it and showed them.. Well I got back my 429... But not the tax... How hard is it to take care of your customers.... I can't believe that this happened."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2015-06-22,1,"Walked in to get Ice Cream.  Workers there completely ignored us, didn't even acknowledge us.  They walked off to the back.  We looked around at the flavors, noticed that most of it was empty or had frost covering it.  Doesn't look like I'd want it anyway."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2015-04-27,3,"I go here often because its the closest dunkin to my job but this place can be awful. I went in there with my DD App trying to figure out if i could use a discount that the app was offering. The girl behind the cash register told me she couldn't help and that i was holding up the line so to either pay or move over. 

I mean seriously that is not how you treat your customers. I was asking her a question and she didn't even want to help a little bit. 

They also constantly mess up orders. And the lines there get so long and backed up it seems everyone is frantic and not in the mood to deal with costumers. 

Today was the last straw. I'd rather pay the food truck for my food then be treat like an inconvenience but the employees of dunkin dounuts,

i will not be going back there again."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2015-02-05,5,Reading previous reviews  (most recent being 2012) much must have changed as the serving time is quick and Staff is friendly. They make my coffee as soon as I walk in every morning. Good stuff.
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2014-12-12,1,"I very rarely give bad reviews, but I just wanted to warn the latte drinkers that stop in here to make sure you check your drink before you walk out.  I made that mistake.

I ordered a medium hot latte and received a cold cup of milk with possible a shot of espresso. How can you forget to steam the milk for a latte?!  Come on!  It was my mistake of walking a few blocks before I took a sip.... Or they would have to give me  10 free donuts to compensate for that ridiculous mistake!"
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2014-09-07,1,"Bad service. The worst.
They wanted to charge us the cup of one cup of water and they don't have restrooms for my 2 and 3 years old daughters after we ate ice creams and coffees there.
If you can choose don go there!!!!"
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2014-09-06,2,Was very excited to try Dunkin donuts in New York but the donuts were hard & service was very bad not somewhere I want to come to again.

34,dunkin-new-york-112,2014-04-24,3,"I consider myself somewhat of an ice cream connoisseur, especially since my first job was at Cold Stone (those were the days). Baskin Robbins' ice cream isn't bad and the guy working at this location is very nice. I got to have two samples and I had the Peanut Butter Cups one. It was a bit bland, but I guess that's because the Reese's cups are in vanilla ice cream. Keep your eye out for dollar scoop days."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2014-03-16,2,A bit disappointing. I ordered a combo but only got the sandwich. Had to tell the girl 4 times what donut I wanted. All of our food came out before my companions drink was started. We finished eating before she got it.
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2014-01-22,3,"Its Dunkin Donuts its what America runs on!!!  I like the Donuts, Munchkins, and Coffee products!!  However, with that being said the amount of stars and below comments are soley based on service...

I will give the cashiers props for being fast but accuracy NO!!!  With speed the need to be accurate is even more important!!  Its like I was rushed out with the wrong order then got scolded like I gave me order ""wrong""....Not the employee gettting the order wrong?!?!

Other then the up & down service i will go back its the closest DD to my job."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2013-10-02,1,"I went in at 9:15pm. Asked for a mint shake. (New York summer is hot) dude said ""sorry. We are about to close in 45 minutes. That's not on.) the blender isn't on?"" It's not a shake machine like fast food. The couple that came in after also asked for a shake. No go! He'll scoop though but apparently that's it. Shady.

34,dunkin-new-york-112,2013-07-04,2,"Decent if you happen to find the freezers working properly on the day of your visit. I have gone in here multiple times and gotten ice cream that is basically melted. At $2.99, it's basically the cheapest around, though."

Wanting to try the limited Cherry Blossom donut, I had but only two people ahead of me that would set my destiny.

The line was long at 9:30 am, but it moved pretty quickly, however, you place your order 1st and then wait for your beverage and food at the other end of the counter.  I received my beverage very quickly, but I had to wait about 7 minutes for my untoasted bagel with cream cheese.  The staff making the food seemed to be overwhelmed with keeping up with the orders, otherwise the bagel was fresh and the hot chocolate was great!"
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2011-09-21,5,"This place definitely saved my butt every morning when I was heading to work.

Some of us hate the location, but I don't have a preference. It's literally next to the NY Time Bldg and Port Authority. You can't miss it unless you're blind.

As far as the food is concerned, it couldn't be any better. It's Dunkin D. The bagels are fresh in the mornings. The donuts too. The coffee is always hot. The servers do a good job in preparing your breakfast very quickly. I do see people ordering huge items in the mornings that can take up a lot of time. I mean ordering 72 donuts with a 5 boxes of coffee. Yeah, when I see people do that, I just leave the store and go to Dean & Deluca because I know that will take lots of time.

Beside that typical nonsense, this is a great location to go in the mornings. Fresh food and fresh coffee to boost your morning."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2011-06-22,4,"I don't drink coffee....

I normally don't eat donuts...

FYI: believe it or not...i actually got food coma from the sandwich.  It was surprisingly pretty filling...

It's not the best bagel...

It's not the best tuna salad...

But it was still a hot (bagel was toasted) lunch and I'm giving the location 4 stars for the following additional reasons:
1) coupon friendly:  we've all been there where franchise owners decide not to honor coupons when they should.
2) super clean: we've all seen how dumpy a D&D can be
3) jiving cashier: cool guy who kept the line moving while keepin it real with the customers"

Unfortunately, they only had one flavor available of the cake donuts munchkins and it was a little stale tasting.  

Iced coffee was good."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2010-05-19,1,"A) There's no public WiFi
B) I didn't think it was possible, but they somehow messed up the chocolate glazed donuts. They tasted pretty odd, despite being soft and seeming freshly made. 

The one star is for the cordiality of the staff. Otherwise, this is an in and out place, if even."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2010-03-17,5,"So it's not as great as my favorite Dunkin' location (in RI), but it's still Dunkin', and it's near work, and I love it! Trust me and try coconut iced coffee. Also try mixing coconut and hazelnut, hazelnut and cinnamon, or coconut and french vanilla. The possibilities are endless. The quality is consistent. The content is rocket fuel. 

Also, one of the servers at this location has really awesome fake eyelashes. They have to be fake. They're just too, too great otherwise. And there's a new server who I really like, a very nice guy named Paris.

Dunkin', I love you."
34,dunkin-new-york-112,2008-01-14,3,"Free wifi at this location!! Woot woot.

Other than that, it's the same as any other D&D. Clean, fast service, limited seating capacity. There's also a Baskin Robins attached."

35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2019-12-05,4,"The pre-packaged fresh food at Pret makes finding a healthy meal on the go, an easy feat. The wide variety of hot foods, sandwiches and salads makes it easy to find a meal no matter what mood you are in. One of my favourites is the Caesar salad which comes with delicious Caesar dressing and is sprinkled with freshly shredding Parmesan cheese. In addition, they also offer a variety of coffees and tea and have many of their own juices and drinks. The many locations around the city allows for one to find a good, quick meal no matter where they are."
35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2019-10-25,5,"I have loved Pret since I spent two years near London. Great sandwiches, great coffees. I did not need a coffee this early in the afternoon and now that my vacation is over, I'm back on my keto diet so no sandwiches. Which is perfectly okay because Pret has salads.

Yeah, it's $12 for their version of a Chicken Caesar but honestly, it was amazing. Delicious, fresh, lots of chicken and those chips you see in the picture? They're cheese chips so no carbs! I also bought one of the little cups with two hard boiled eggs and added that to the salad.

Yum, yum, yum and completely on my keto program.

There are some high top ""community"" tables here and they have a wifi. So eat here or take it with you and eat on the train.

I visited the store that is at the bottom of the escalator (turn left) at the 7th Avenue entrance.

35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2019-07-22,1,"I would give this place no ratings if possible. After a long, hot and frustrating day of commuting on the NJ transit, I decided to grab a quick bite to eat. After almost finishing my sandwich I began pulling it apart and I came across this large, old, dead bug tucked in between my sandwich. When I brought it to the cashier's attention he asked if I wanted another sandwich... eventually they gave me money back for my sandwich but I still feel more should be done about this. I will never buy pre packaged food again or go to a Pret a Manger. I'm still disgusted."
35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2019-07-22,2,"I usually like Pret, in fact this was my only negative experience at a Pret, but the cashier was very rude and unhelpful.  This Pret (located inside of Penn Station) does not match the same high standards of customer service as those in Boston and London."
35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2019-07-11,1,"I almost swallowed a piece of broken plastic from the Mediterranean falafel salad I purchased from penn station tonight. The piece of plastic is about the size of a fingernail and has several sharp edges. My mouth sustained some minor scratches. I took some pictures of it before throwing the rest of the salad away immediately. My family and I used to be huge fans of Pret before today's event. Pret has promised food safety to its customer, and it should go beyond mere freshness."
35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2019-07-09,3,"More like ""Pray for Flavor."" I wanted to give this place a shot since they are all over the city. I bought a wrap and fruit salad before boarding a train. The wrap was dry, no sign of the advertised dressings. It was thin, mainly shell. Big disappointment. The fruit cup was okay, for what tasted like frozen fruit. I honestly don't understand the hype. Are other locations better?"
35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2019-05-23,3,"Pretty standard Pret in Penn Station with limited seating but a good selection of items from soups to salads to bowls.  The staff are pretty brisk and impatient but service is not the forte here.  Overall, not a bad option for a quick bite to take on the road."
35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2019-05-21,3,"Oh the disappointment. 
I guess my first mistake was going to a chain. Second was going to the subway station one.
For $15 for a lox and $9 for a sausage egg n cheese...
That ISHHHH better be good. 
Everyone said, try the NY bagels. They are super good! 
I didn't like it, and frankly, my $5 bagels in California are just the same. The bread here at Pret a Manger was too dense for my liking."
35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2019-04-29,5,I seriously love this location. It's so clean and the staff is SO kind every time I'm in here. My coffee always comes out so quick. As long as I'm coming to Penn station I'll be coming here :)
35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2019-02-01,5,"Pret A Manger the best !
Friendly staff  
Download the app coz they offer free drinks sometimes 
Organic delicious coffees"
35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2019-02-01,4,"Pret a Manger food is good and convenient. The food is made fresh daily and disposed of at closing. The Caesar salad with chicken, the chicken, quinoa, and sweet potato, and the chicken wrap with balsamic dressing dressing are my top three favorites. Best of all, the Carrot Cake Cookie, is by far the best damn cookie I've had In a long time! Please try this cookie, you will not be disappointed!!"
35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2018-10-15,4,"Always friendly smiles and interaction from employees, which can't be easy in such a busy location. Manager from this location should be sent to other locations to straighten them up. Getting food from a train station anywhere, let alone Penn Station, is iffy to me but I've never given it much thought since I first started picking up lunch here quite a while ago."
35,pret-a-manger-new-york-92,2018-09-05,4,"You'd think that a commuter cafe would have poor service, but the people working here couldn't be sweeter. This morning, I went to pick up an oatmeal raisin cookie, and Gabriela gave me an extra one on the house. Had me leaving with a big smile on my face! Pret knows what they're doing in terms of service and quality. 

Their cookies are huge and smell amazing. I hate to use such a generic word, but that's what it is - the smell is intoxicating. They're warm and baked fresh. What a bargain!  

This Pret is busy, but they keep the lines moving very quickly. You'll rarely wait longer than a minute. There's also WiFi, outlets, and a bit of seating, but no bathroom of its own, FYI."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2020-04-27,5,"We have been in quarantine for the last 8 weeks in NYC and everything has been shutdown. This is the first Starbucks I saw open while walking my dog and I almost cried! I appreciate the small thing now, things we took for granted. 

There were two couples on the line in front of me and everyone was wearing masks (including myself). I placed my order on my mobile app and my order was ready writhing 4 mins of me being there. You aren't allowed to go inside so they have set up a table by the door where they place your order. 

Such a great system!! Well done Starbucks!! Thank you for reopening again in New York and thank you to everyone who is working. We appreciate you all!!

36,starbucks-new-york-469,2020-02-15,3,"Is it folly to rate a Starbucks? Aren't they all supposed to be homogenized copies of each other serving overly burnt coffee with milkshakes dressed up line serious drinks? The plus of this Starbucks is that at least it's right next to Bryant Park, so there's somewhere to hunker down while you wait for someone, instead of freezing in the bitter cold or roasting heat.

On the downside, the location is tiny, making a New York studio apartment seem downright luxurious and roomy in comparison. Service can be slow even with no one in line ahead or behind you, while the only coffee on brew is their default pike peak roast"
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2019-11-12,1,I'm not even joking. What is this???? WHAT IS THIS? is this green tea matcha latte or throwing matcha powder in the milk??
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2019-11-05,1,"I've never felt like Starbucks could do me wrong, but this particular location is terrible. The employees do not belong in customer service, period. The rudeness and lack of ownership is appalling. I waited 30 minutes for my order, a crowd of people came in and left and I still didn't get anything. I asked the baristas at least 5x if something went wrong and if my order was coming and they said they were working on it. Come to find out they don't have the ingredients for my drink and the female barista (who was super rude in her tone) tells me I should have ordered something else because they can't make it. Wtf??! When I asked them how would I even know they couldn't unless the guy at the register told me they don't have the ingredients, she rolled her eyes and showed attitude and the guy at register laughed saying ""oh whoops"". I wanted my money back but another barista stepped in and offered to make a different tea, which I accepted so I could get out of there and move on with my day. The one star is just for that guy who saw the situation and helped. Otherwise, what a waste of time dealing with rude af people. Starbucks should be ashamed of this location."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2019-09-08,3,Good sized store with a few chairs to sit on. Staff was quick and friendly. Coffee was average.
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2019-01-03,1,"My experience with a particular Starbucks worker, Lisa, was not pleasurable at all. I went to place my order and she was being unnecessarily rude to such a simple order and had a negative attitude. Starbucks has always been my go to coffee place because of the welcoming environment with workers. Never have I encountered a bad experience with a Starbucks worker until today. Lisa does not adequately represent the Starbucks motto."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2018-12-29,1,Place tells someone who obviously is handicapped that they don't have a bathroom - and to walk 10 blocks away.  Wonder what the employees do or how they wash their hands.  Or is it because I'm white???
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2018-10-30,4,"Grabbed coffee here and it was an average experience --nothing too much to get excited about.  The service was quick and efficient, and staff friendly and polite.  

Great location for where I was staying, though that said, you can't walk 5 meters in New York without passing a coffee shop so I'm not sure the location counts.  

The prices were pretty reasonable and not too much more than the in smaller cities.

Good sized store with a great variety, though no seating inside or out.  Only complaint is that they don't open until 5:30 --come on Starbucks, isn't this place supposed to be a 24/7 city..."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2018-08-23,4,"I went to Starbucks this morning because I was in need of a Caffeine fix. The staff here was really nice and polite. 

My iced latte with a splash of coconut milk was  a watered down (meaning too much milk). But, I continued on my walk to the office. 

I will come to this location again if I am in the area."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2018-06-15,1,"Full disclosure, I work for Starbucks and I love what I do. My experience at this store was awful. Absolutely no customer service, I mobile ordered and it said 3-5 min and my drinks would be ready... well my food was, but 12 min. Later I got my drinks. My food was cold by then and my drink was a complete disappointment. 

I watched my partners and how they were running their floor and their routines and I was amazed at how far out of routine they were. People who had ordered drinks after other customers were getting their drinks first. No one wanted to be on cold bar. So if you had a hot beverage your drink was made WAY before any cold beverage drink.

The customer service made me embarrassed to be a partner. This store is so close to where I was staying, but I will not be going back! I'll walk a little farther next time. 

I can't express enough how disappointed I was with the environment the partners provided for our customers. Please don't base your Starbucks experience off this one store. I promise they are all not this bad."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2018-06-13,1,"If I could give negative stars I would. This store has gone to complete and utter crap within the last 3 months or so. New management took over and it looks as if the entire old team has left as a result. This store always has an issue, a flood, no heat in the winter, no AC in the summer--not that the manager or corporate cares. They insist on keeping the store open so that employees and customers can suffer and freeze their balls off or roast them like marshmallows. The new manager never staffs enough people, there's only 5 people behind the counter with 5x the amount of customers on line alone!!! And forget mobile ordering-it can take up to 20 minutes just to have your drink made-and wrong at that!. The store is dirty with garbage around, there's never snacks or cold grab and go drinks replenished anymore, the staff always looks frazzled and unsupported,the manager is nasty to customers because she's slow at making drinks, and she doesn't staff enough. Or who knows maybe the old team saw how fast this place was sinking,that they all abandoned ship. It's a shame because the staff really used to be wonderful. The only ones left are a few sweet girls who try to do the best they can with what their given by their ""manager"". I wish I can say I'll go to one of the other locations in the area but they all suck --almost as much as this place."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2018-02-22,5,Unbelievable service!! Imani and jenae were soooo nice. The day before my coffee was made right but the beans may have been a little burnt. Not their fault! But the next day they remembered me and took such excellent care of me. This is why I only come to this one!!! Thank you Starbucks 39th!!!
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2018-02-12,3,This is your typical Starbucks nothing really wow's me from this store they can be a hit or miss as far as making your drinks it really depends on who's working that day. I for one don't care for the staff here they seem to be missing a lot of energy. What happened to Starbucks?
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2017-11-19,2,Wow ... this has to be the slowest Starbucks in the system. Beware when you are ordering as the service here is not going to get you caffeinated and on your way quickly.
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2017-10-24,5,I love this Starbucks! Super friendly staff and service is always on point. Drinks and food are served fast.
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2017-10-22,5,"There seem to be a lot of these smaller, what I'd call ""to go,"" locations popping up.  They aren't intended for lingering.  Take it for what it is. 

When we walked in the door, the store was clean and we were greeted immediately. Our drinks were made quickly and they tasted just as they should.  If you are not looking for a bathroom or a place to hang out, you will be happy with this Starbucks."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2017-09-07,1,"One of the worse Starbucks around. The staff needs to be retrained. They do not listen when taking your order (talking loud and about inappropriate stuff) which leads to incorrect coffee and breakfast orders. When the errors are mentioned to them, they tell you to fix it yourself....ummm isn't this your job. The best Starbucks is on 42nd St & 6th Ave., great friendly staff and if there is an error (rarely happens) they fix it right away."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2017-04-11,2,"No bathroom at this location. If you need to take a dump you're in trouble.

Typical Starbucks jammed into a narrow spot. Seems like they look for any hole to fit in a store. Not much seating at all here, as in basically none, so it's not really a spot to bring your computer to surf the web.

Service was ok and whipped up my iced drink pretty quickly. A grab and go spot.

At least this one is close to Bryant Park so you can take your drink there, sit on a chair by the lawn, and watch the world walk by on a perfect NYC spring day."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2017-02-17,5,"Fast, efficient, friendly (for the most part). I stop in here every day during the morning commute hours and it's my favorite."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2017-02-14,1,"Serious. This Starbuck location need to improve their Sevice and employee knowledge. 
I order a large carml frappe with whip cream and wait for 5 mins and I got the wrong drink and I spoke with the staff and tell him this is not my drink and he look so upset and unhappy to make a new one for me. He ignore me and let me wait other 5 mins and the other staff sense that I am not happy with that. And the other staff start to make a new one for me. And happen again. This guy ask me if I want whip cream and and say yes.  He looked at me, say we don't have whip cream. So, I was shocked. This is not my problem.  U need to come prepare with your job. 
finally I spoke with the manager and she apologized and willing to refund for me. Then happen again. 
They charge me another drink price again instead of refund. That mean I pay for $6.91 twice($13.82) for 1 drink . Sigh totally unacceptable.
Then I need to walk back again and ask them refund... please train your staff."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2017-01-12,1,"This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. The employees here are rude and so pathetic when it comes to basic listening skills and customer service.

I come here because it is near my corporate office when I am in town on business. I get basic drinks. If anything, I ask for no sweetener. They have messed up the orders EVERY TIME.

The girls are rude and refuse to make eye contact or talk to you. They make a big fuss when you tell them the order is incorrect. And the men here have yet to take my order correctly. One of the guys in the AM who is usually in charge of warming up the food is the only one that seems remotely decent when it comes to customer service.

On top of that - super slow. Even if you are the only person in the store.

Never giving this place another shot. Save yourself the trouble and go another block or two to the next location."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2017-01-12,2,"slowest customer service ever. There are no seats but you see a ton of tourists just huddling around so even when it's not busy, its super packed. The downside was that it took 15 minutes for 2 drinks when there was only 1 person in front of us. The barista even made a drink for the person who ordered after us, and considering how empty it was, there was no way it should've taken this long for a simple caramel machiatto."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2016-12-13,1,"Wow. Just wow. This is the only Starbucks on my way to work, and it's always terrible. I got in at 8:20AM today. They took my order for a very simple unsweetened iced tea at maybe 8:25.. I have to be at work by 8:30, which is a pipe dream if I come to this location before hand, but the line wasn't very long, so I thought I'd get away with it. Nope. By 8:48 I was out the door. Yes, I have the time down to the minute because I was fuming. It wasn't too busy when I got in, and there were at least 5 people behind the counter. The slowest workers I have ever encountered. As an ex Starbucks employee, I understand how stressful it can get.. But this was beyond unacceptable. The fact that it took over 20 minutes for me to get my drink was insane. I didn't yell at anyone, because I understand how that can make a barista nervous and maybe screw up an order, and I didn't want to add any extra time to the over 20 minutes I'd already been there. I don't really know what else to say. The workers are usually friendly enough, but not one of them looked very worried that people were waiting a ridiculously long time for their orders. There was absolutely no urgency what-so-ever.

This is the 3rd time I've tried popping in before work, but never again. Whoever said that this is a fast and efficient location must be going at a dead hour, because this has ever been my experience. Again, to me the workers are friendly enough, although one girl rolled her eyes at me when I asked about one of the breakfast sandwiches, which was rude. 

That's it for me. Don't go here if you're in a hurry. Ever."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2016-11-02,5,"Love this Starbucks. Fast, efficient and friendly. I've been going here just about everyday for the past year before work. I am usually annoyed with the service of SB around NYC, but this one will not."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2016-09-15,5,"I love this Starbucks location! People who works there are amazing - very friendly and professional. Jamal thank you a lot!! Also it is not very crowded store, you can get your order fast, which is the huge benefit when you have limited time for lunch."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2016-09-02,1,The staff is very unsanitary. Dirtiest I've ever seen a Starbucks staff. Refuse to ever go back here.
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2016-08-28,1,"3 out of 4 drink orders that went in AFTER mine came out BEFORE mine -- that's with 4-5 people working behind the counter too.  They were out of drinks they advertised and I heard them tell another customer they didn't have the fruit to make her frappuccino nor did they have the toppings I requested on mine. I overheard one of the employees tell another one that they were out of Coconut milk and he was telling them to use something else (I'm assuming it was soy) without even notifying or consulting me.  When he realized I was within earshot's distance he asked if it was okay if they did Soy instead, to which I replied no and requested 2%. Low and behold when they went to go get that they found coconut milk (which shows the store is a bit disorganized in addition to being inefficient). I always wondered why there were so many Dunkin' Donuts around here and the answer is they are probably collecting dissatisfied Starbucks customer as Starbucks selfishly changes their rewards program and is constantly out of every other thing, both food and drink-wise."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2016-08-12,2,"The woman who took my order was so rude and had a bad attitude . That alone did it for me, I can't stand workers with bad attitudes . She also avoided looking me in the eye when taking my order too . I'm used to much more nice , pleasant happy workers in Starbucks, so yea I mostly likely will Never go to this location again. 
 But I must say The girl who made my drink was nice and pleasant  and she made my drink really tasty and that's the only reason they're  getting two stars instead of one."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2016-05-09,1,"Holy Jesus was this place terrible. Employees have no idea what they are doing. They're too busy talking to themselves. I just wanted a coffee to brighten my day and the entire experience from start to finish was terrible. There are other Starbucks near by, go to those ones. This place ""offers"" cold brew and they don't have it. Awful. 100% awful. Not even deserving of one star. I didn't even want a complicated order, just an unwatered down iced coffee and the employee seemed unable to understand that. Instead I got a venti dark and someone took it! They made me another but really?! Awful"
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2016-05-05,3,"a small typical starbucks location that is always busy and crowded and it's lacks enough seating options unless you like standing by the window and have the hobos stare at you while you are trying to enjoy a venti cappy and a blueberry scone. i never had an issue with the staff who are always busy making hot and cold beverages for the folks who work in the area. the decor is modern starbuckish with a few giant photos on the front and back wall . yes it's small inside and putting a few tables is out of the question so it's order and go unless you don't mind feeling like being in a sardine can. the usual pastries, sandwiches, snack options and music is always some independent artist or group , overall a 3.5 stars cause the lady barista makes a mean tasty mocha frappe ."
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2016-04-07,4,"Your typical Starbucks.  It's a modern, newer location, and spacious with a nice photo canvas in the back of the store.  However, this location has a SEVERE lack of seating (as in none).  The midtown crowd creates a lengthy line throughout the day, but their mobile ordering speed is definitely up to par.  I come to this location pretty regularly - the baristas are friendly and great overall.  Nothing out of the ordinary from your typical NYC Starbucks. 

That is, except for one thing.  There are expensive (read: $6.95) gourmet chocolate bars as you're waiting in line made by chuao.  One of them is milk chocolate covered potato chips.  I haven't seen these at any other location and hope to try one at some point.  I just learned yesterday, though, that you can redeem your Starbucks Rewards reward on one of them =) so yay for that!"
36,starbucks-new-york-469,2016-02-01,1,"Rude rude rude employees. I work in the office upstairs, I've been getting pike place iced from the Starbucks a few blocks over (an unpopular choice I'm sure) which I enjoy. Ordered here and they laughed in my face and talked down to me about my coffee choice. Pretty sure I know what my tastebuds like and for 4$ a coffee I don't need to be talked down to by an employee."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2020-03-15,1,"I'd say you may want to avoid this location, especially if you're pressed for time, like on a lunch break. 

On 3/6 for my 1-hour lunch/dinner break at work I decided to walk over to this spot and redeem an offer for a free Tartine reward that I had earned. This location is a 10-minute walk from my job each way. The place was dead, there were maybe 5 tables with customers, 1 server (although there were at least 3 other employees walking around) and I could see two cooks in the kitchen. I promptly placed my order, sat and waited. 30-minutes later the food had yet to arrive, and I was down to my last few minutes of my break. I told the waitress that if it was going to take much longer that I would just have it to go because I was running out of time. 12-minutes later and I'm STILL waiting for the damn food. So I got up to pay for the drink I ordered to just leave without eating. At that precise moment is when the waitress appears with my food prepped in a to-go box, 42-minutes after I had placed my order -- unreal! I mean, how long does it take to make a couple of toast with some chicken on top?!

To add insult to injury, I'd previously provided my reward account information to redeem the offer saved. But then the waitress said she couldn't find my reward. I told her it's saved on my phone but apparently she didn't know how to work the register  either, so she ask that I wait some more for her manager who was in the basement office to come up and lend her a hand with the redemption. At this point I'm in complete disbelief that she would have the nerve to ask me to do some more waiting. I said I couldn't wait even if I wanted to and for her to just charge me for the food so I can run out to get back to my job as fast as humanly possible -- all to no avail since I ended up getting back to work late, too. 

So in the end I waisted my lunch hour waiting, paid for food that should've been complimentary, got back to work late, AND had to eat my food cold and soggy some 4-hours later after I got out of work. 

Never. Again."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2019-09-18,5,"Pumpkin muffin and Harvest bowl need to be tried, as good as seasonal delicacies get... Great service in the late afternoon, my barista was really sweet."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2019-09-11,1,"Me thinks not, indeed. Ordered through Seamless and they completely bungled my order. Sent meat on my egg sandwich that was supposed to be just egg, avocado and cheese. Meat wasn't even an option. Didn't send my juice. Charged $5 for delivery (plus tip) and when I called to ask them to send the right sandwich and the missing juice, she said ""no"". Uhh. Why not? She said that I can place a new order... new tip, new delivery fee etc.. I was like, look kid, get a grown up on the phone, get the manager and she said, I am the manager. And then I sort of lost my cool and told her I'd throw the bacon in her face, it gets a little blurry, but it ended in a refund."

Both times the restaurant only had a couple tables so it's not like they were busy. Also, one of the times the 2 waiters were in the back looking at their phones and exchanging giggles  and I sat there for about 5 minutes after I gave up and left. Won't be giving this location another try.

Elizabeth, it's not that I didn't enjoy my dining experience. I did not get to have one because your staff rather play with their phones. See many other reviews from this locations and you will see a pattern."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2019-07-17,4,Fresh bread and French boulangerie that's whats great about Le Pain Quotidien!
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2018-09-10,4,"Pretty good. Service needs some work tho. Overall, though the food is pretty good just very small portions."

37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2018-08-20,1,I ordered  salad- I asked for bread  when the salad arrived without any -the waitress said that will cost you-what a surprise-the bread arrived-2 three  inch slices from a  baguette-then the bill arrived- mon dieu- well over four dollars for the bread- ill never go there anymore
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2018-08-15,4,"The warm grain bowl in fidi is a little better and I'm not even sure why. The blueberry muffin was everything I needed and more, moist and delicious. The client here on a Wednesday morning/noon is laughable. Deranged 50+ who have lived in Chelsea for decades, your occasional apple employee who's ""vegan"", Hetero duos. Etc.
The staff is nice but from as a person who works the trash food industry I can tell they probably want to die lmao. Still happy I stopped in. You know she loves a good le pain moment."

I typically go in the mornings around 8 am - I am ALWAYS greeted with a smile, the staff makes you feel at home and greets me by name. Food is always fresh and delicious. Coffee is tasty!

They leave a huge line of people waiting while they idle around. They WILL forget your drinks and take 30 mins to serve a glass of water. PQ in NYC and DC suck service wise, the managers do nothing to train staff and act very unprofessionally... save your money for PQ UK or on west coast. Screw you guys"
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2018-03-30,4,Love this location but it takes so long to get someone to clean the table from previous customers. Servers Are not the most friendliest unfortunately. Perfect place for healthy and fresh breakfast/lunch/brunch (maybe little overpriced though). Awesome cappuccino and espresso.
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2018-02-19,5,The eggs and salmon were delicious! Mimosa was tasty as was the espressos. Marco was a great server.

This morning we sat and weren't greeted and after 20 minutes we went to the front register to order.    It was 35 minutes before someone came to our table for the first time (I would have left but they charged my credit card up the register) to greet us and he had no idea we already placed our order at the front.    We sat another there 5 minutes before our avocado toast came.   Still no water or sharing plates.   During this time, two tables left after ten minutes and another went to the front register to order.    Not sure if this is normal but most certainly ruined my experience."

All the sugar and fresh milk in the world can't save a cup of crap, which I'm pretty sure this was. 

My friend got chai latte with a shot of espresso in it, and hated hers too. Too many eateries around to choose this generic place.

Oh!! Also, for the (low) quality, it's expensive!!! Nearly $6 for ONE cup of garbage coffee. And they give you paper To Go cups just to drink outside, which feels rather impersonal and cheap to me. Like, bro. I'm not gonna steal your mugs...."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2017-04-22,2,"Overpriced. No man with pride in being a man should ever stop into this chain. Let the women have it. Ersatz Paris with all the affected trimmings.

37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2017-03-06,1,Terrible service! I walked in and saw the sign wait to be seated so I waited and the guy said to go ahead and sit. As I grabbed a seat I was given no acknowledgement or even a hello or menu. So I grabbed one and waited and waited for someone to come over. They could clearly see me and yet I was ignored. Perhaps they were racist. All the other tables were being attended to and I sat there like an idiot. Worst feeling in the world. I grabbed my stuff and stormed out. I'll never return there and I'll let others know as well. Complete humiliation. Others could see I was waiting but to no avail.
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2017-01-07,4,Can't really go wrong with this interesting chain.
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2016-12-10,5,"Happened to walk by this place while looking for somewhere to get a hot cup of something (it can get cold on the high line in December!). Was delightfully surprised to find several exciting vegan options on the menu and that the Belgian hot chocolate could also be made vegan. My two omnivorous companions and I ordered waffles, a pecan-chocolate tart and the vegan pecan flute, as well as two hot chocolates and hot cider that my friend said was the best he'd ever had! We were really happy with everything. Wonderful ingredients, great in-house products. So happy we walked in!"
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2016-09-25,4,"Got coffee and pastries here daily for about a year. It's a sold chain French café in the Chelsea/Meatpacking district. They make good coffee and have acceptable wines for when you stop in for lunch or happy hour.

My only complaint is that it's a tad pricey for what you're getting (a chain café, just a step up from the likes of Starbucks) and the service for sit-down patrons can sometimes be sub-par. By contrast, the line for takeout always moves very quickly and it was perfect for my needs when I was in the area."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2016-09-13,4,"I come for lunch pretty often in the summertime. The food is fresh and light and great for sharing. This location in particular has a weird smell on the corner tables. Seems like the wood has soaked up a weird stench. 

the food is good nonetheless. I love their open face sandwiches and was surprised when one waitress asked if I'd like it heated up. MIND BLOWN. Definitely get it hot if you're so inclined. the chicken mozzarella definitely tastes better toasted. 

The farmer's lunch always makes me feel like i've accomplished something great. I usually eat a lot of fried meat crap, so this is a refreshing detox meal. Comes with Gazpacho, quinoa salad with arugula and avocado toast. it's actually quite delish!

of course i ruin after with a heavy dessert. shame on me."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2016-09-09,4,"I was in Chelsea (as I usually am :) ) with two friends and decided to try Le Pain. I heard the avocado toast was a must have, so I naturally opted for it. We were seated pretty quickly, and the food also came in a decent amount of time. The toast was a longer piece of bread than I expected, so that was a pleasant surprise. It was topped with a good amount of avocado, some pieces of kale, tomato slices, and chia seeds, so I got my healthy fix for the day. Everything was also arranged in an aesthetically pleasing fashion; the table was complete with pinecones for the holidays. But the dish itself was pretty bland, and I expected more flavor for the price I was paying (~$12)."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2016-08-24,5,"While I only stop by the kiosk for a coffee in the morning, it's always consistent, friendly and quick.

37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2016-08-13,1,"The food was good. I had a avocado toast am a watermelon fresh juice. Nothing transcendental but ok for the money spent. 2 waiters were really nice, the guys who served me and I saw another girl running all the time. The rest of the team was just lazy. I had to ask the check to the manager, my waiter was busy and she was too distracted to prepare the ch k and clean my table. She brought me the check but instead of finishing was she was doing she asked the poor busy guy to take care of me that she had to go to the office downstair...!"
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2016-08-02,3,Nice place but was over charged and unfortunately the employee was unable to refund my money. The manager was off property. Interesting when the manager came back while we were seated outside she never came by to fix the problem. Check your receipt to make sure you're charged accurately.
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2016-04-18,5,"I. LOVE. BREAD.

I EAT BREAD. EVERY. DAY.

It's hard to describe the fantasticness of this place without quoting Oprah, but srsly. This place has phenomenal bread. 

Be sure to get the avocado toast - lightly sprinkled with chia seeds, kale, salt, and lemon on the side for you to dash on yourself, this is the perfect way to start your morning."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2016-03-03,3,Had an underwhelming mozzarella melt and tea. Total $24 with tip. Not worth the price. Menu was very limited on protein choices.
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2016-02-26,1,"The point of placing a ""Wait to be seated"" sign is that your guest (civilized people) will expect a greeter/host to acknowledge and assist them to an available table. Where one is not available, that said host will inform the guest. I say go elsewhere with people who know what restaurant table service is about ."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2015-12-29,1,"This place doesn't have its act together. It was my second time here; and my second bad experience. Ironically enough, this time I paid with a gift certificate they game me for my first terrible experience - and even though I wanted to give them a second shot at getting things right, they can't deliver.

The first time I went, I got my order for take-out. Got the bag, went back home. Sat down, opened everything up, just to realize that half the order is completely missing and the half that was in there was not even correct (the wrong sandwich, or 'tartine' as they pretentiously call it). It was pouring rain, and I had to head back. Then wait again for the order to be re-made.

It was kind of them to issue a gift card. But then...today. I go in to order for take-out again. Got a sandwich ('tartine') and soup. The total? $25! Wow. For a soup & sandwich combo basically. I was waiting for a long time while 2 people at the register tried to figure out how to process the gift card. They didn't even know how to transact with their own gift cards. That's just hard to understand. Then I got my $25 order and left. A couple blocks down my walk I realized that the plastic bag is filthy and oily and has a ton of random food pieces on it (and what looked like spilled soup maybe). But I looked inside and my soup wasn't spilled. So when packing, they must have had a dirty surface or hands. Some of the oily junk made it on my jacket but I grabbed a tissue to wipe off just in time. I went back to get a new bag. They couldn't care less that the one they gave me was filthy.

Then the food. Finally got home to eat my $25 deluxe meal. It was completely uninspiring. The soup was supposed to be a chicken noodle type variation. I was digging around looking for chicken. There was literally 2 small pieces, the size of a nickel each, in the whole $11 bowl. It was mostly pieces of potato. And it was completely flavorless. Same goes for the 'tartine' - no flavor, and so small that a baby wouldn't even feel like it had a meal and would be crying for more.

Never eating at this place again."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2015-12-15,1,"Beautiful sunny and warm day in mid Dec, grabbed a baguette with ham and cheese and cornichons at the Chelsea branch's outside kiosk to eat at the outside tables in the sun. Bread was so stale, almost impossible to bite into. Second poor quality sandwich from this chain, never again."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2015-12-03,5,"Really great location across from the 24th street Apple Store. Just on the edge of the old meat packing district. The place is small but has a charm to it and when the beautiful days are here they open the front of the store and it gives the illusion of being on a terrace. The food is always great and the bread is delicious. One of my favorites is the ""botanist"" a platter of hummus, taboule, and the most delicious guacamole. The bread served with this is an assortment including a walnut bread that is out of this world. 
The decor is always the same, on every location and is nice and cozy. Go there, eat well and have a great time."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2015-06-18,3,"Good, solid higher-end bakery/cafe chain...But for better pastries, head a few blocks north to La Bergamote ;)

This location is smaller than other locations and loaded with Meatpacking/Chelsea Market tourists, which slows everything down. 

Food: 4-stars
Ambiance: 3.5-stars
Service: 3-stars
Value: 3-stars

I'm torn, cause I wanna give them 4-stars, but I just can't cause every time I come, I have to order two entrees/plates in order to get full as the portions are small/light, and I end up spending over $20 just on myself for breakfast or lunch. 

I like that their items are of high quality, but as they tend to be low on the amount of proteins they offer, I end up eating a double portion of carbs, usually bread, and then I'm hungry again in an hour.  

The price/value is just ok and service is generally slow at most locations. 

Overall, a great spot for lunch if you're looking for something light, however, their breakfast & dinner menus are somewhat limited on options that keep you full. 

My favorite items are the ham & cheese Quiche and the Avocado toast, but, better to come here for coffee and pastries as those are very good and well-priced for what you get."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2015-06-05,2,"Such a disappointment...
We had salad and a sandwitch.
The cesar salad was fair, nothing special nor bad.
The sandwitch was awful, and so tiny!
And for the prices they ask for, its such a disappointment.
Never going there again"
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2015-06-01,1,"What a disappointment, the worst sandwich I have ever had. Smoked salmon spread on a slice of old stale bread without any sauce or garnish. Extremely dry and tasteless."
37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2015-01-26,4,"With outposts all over the island, you'll be sure to find a LPQ pretty much in any hood. It is a great option for healthier meals on-the-go at decent prices in the city. Don't miss the avocado toast if they have it...it is delish! If you've not been to LPQ before, it is an international chain that serves very consistent great coffee, baked goods, and French style breakfast and lunch food. I have not had a single thing from the menu that wasn't simple and delicious. There are many choices for healthy meals. Nothing too fancy, just good, reliable food and coffee and fair prices."

37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2014-07-04,3,"Reminds me of the La Madeleine chain. 
Fresh breads, baked items, breakfast and lunch menu. The veggie quiche was delicious. One of the best quiches I've had in a restaurant. The side salad that came on the plate was nothing fabulous. I enjoyed my bowl of fresh berries and the coffee was decent, too. The service was painfully slow and they weren't even busy. Maybe you will have better luck if you order to go. 
Good variety and lots of tables. Not sure if I will be back since there are so many other great brunch places, but this a reliable option- albeit slow- for a reasonably priced meal."

37,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-135,2014-04-04,2,"The service is what really killed it for me. I walked in, waited for a bit for a waiter or staff to notice me and then I was told I could sit anywhere I liked. I proceeded to sit...and wait. 

I did notice that a woman walked in after me and was immediately served while I began to play with the menu, after minutes passing by with no service. This place was by no means busy and everyone who was seated when I arrived had already been served. Even when I received my order, it was slightly incorrect. The food was average tasting, but it probably seemed worse because my waiter seemed pained to have to even tend to my table. 

I then had to wait longer than everyone near me for my check. The woman who came in before me and was served before me? Her check was automatically brought to her, while I had to signal and ask...sigh. 

This is not 1960 and we are not in the south - I'll probably never come here or to any other LPQ again."

The end."

Although it is a chain, it is super delicious belgian food (perfect for lunch, brunch and breakfast), great bakery, awesome variety of bread. Peps are talking about how expensive, etc but I don't even slightly agree. I believe the opposite is true: it is a grossly under-rated, incredibly good restaurant/bakery although service might differ from one location to another and the staff might not all be trained perfectly.

In 1 minute, I had three waiters come up to me and say that tables are for dining customers only. I'm still unsure why I got those nasty looks from them. Half of the place was empty.

Well, that's what I did yesterday and I can tell you that it was quite enjoyable!

I had an iced cappuccino and since I couldn't settle on any 1 dessert I chose to sample a little of everything.

They had a sampler selection of 4 micro-mini tarts which consisted of lemon, blueberry with custard, chocolate and pistachio. They were bite-size servings and quite tasty. I also had a micro-mini brownie muffin which was moist and very brownie-esque. I've rarely eaten macaroons so I'm far from a connoisseur but thought these were good in that they were not overly dry, overly chewy nor overly sweet.

I'm a fan of this place....."

Finally had a real authentic hot chocolate in the city. Meted Belgian chocolate arrived in a creamer dish which you pour into a big hot bowl of milk- yumm. Needed a bit of sugar added since the chocolate appeared to be unsweetened and tasted like cocoa but that aside, good! I had a chicken and cheddar sandwich (which they serve open faced). It was good but the mustard they put on it was a little too strong and hot for my liking...prices are reasonable and the sandwich left me full.

I love their Goat Cheese & Arugula salad! Parmesan, toasted pine nuts, and organic olive oil.

If i get an Iced drink and request light ice or no ice the ice is full to the top and they must remake...then they seem upset with me like I made it wrong!?!?  Coming in is a crap shoot because you could be in there waiting for at least 15 minutes.  If you catch it not crowded or a light crowd that's your chance for a full cup and good service!!

I just wish this location would be more consistent with service and the accuracy of drinks...*insert sad face*"
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2019-11-29,1,What a joke. They decided on Black Friday to limit the drink menu.  The place was dead.  No one was in the store.  So instead they lost out on four people getting drinks.  The manager should be fired.
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2019-11-19,3,"A decent Starbucks without a public restroom.

This Starbucks is small and a fine Starbucks. I got my typical fall/winter drink, coffee with the caramel bruelee syrup in it. An easy order and a hard one to mess up. The ordering layout in this store is a bit off from the typical layout and it took a bit longer than normal just to get coffee. The baristas were not the nicest ones i've encountered but decent enough. This store is lacking in a public restroom, which I know isn't required in NYC, but is kind of absurd considering the size of this city and also anywhere else Starbucks has a restroom. It's a fine Starbucks, nothing to get excited over but they'll give you the caffeine fix you need."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2019-09-08,1,"Ordered online and my drink was only 75% filled.
So if you want to pay 100% for a 75% of a cup of coffe this is definitely the place to go"
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2019-05-15,4,"Great Starbucks! The drinks were made great the couple times I went! The music was great and the staff were friendly!
The store was clean each time I went in. The displays were neat and organized. There is no public restroom however."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2018-12-17,1,"If I could give them no stars I would. the cashier lady had a nasty attitude when I gave her my order and it took all 3 employees present to diffuse an incident within the store. Because of this, it took over 20 minutes for me just to get the cookie I ordered"
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2018-09-09,2,"No where to sit... music way too loud...not a place to sip and relax....
Several people work here but only 2 seem to be actually working...also no bathroom"
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2018-08-26,1,Really bad service at the fulfillment bar. 3-4 people making beverages with no sense of urgency. Waited more than 10 minutes for a lemonade.
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2018-08-20,1,The worst overall Starbucks ever. Extra low despite me being there off peak hrs. 13 mins. For a cold brew cáscara.   What a mess.
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2018-07-13,2,"Place is always crazy crowded because it is tiny, and it is near the meth head mcdonalds so there is usually some less than desirable people outside, avoid this place and walk another block to another location."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2018-07-05,5,"This location is much more of a Starbucks Express. The interior is no frills - no tables, no chairs, no restroom, no outlets. They have a counter top to stand at if you're waiting for an Uber, for example, but not to take a load off.

Why the high rating? Very simple: it always serves the purpose. The customer service here is very polite and capable. Most recently, Steven and Mohammad were super kind and patient. I popped in with my infant child who was hot and cranky. Despite that I had a stroller, they made my drink and didn't give me a hard time about a crying baby. I was able to console him within minutes, I just needed to take him out of the stroller for a sec. They even gave me a water on the side Bc it's 10,000 degrees out. 

Thanks for being so cool to a Ma. Thanks also, for getting my cold brew perfy."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2018-05-13,1,This Starbucks is the closest location to one of my offices and I dread coming here. Although I always mobile order to avoid the lines/crowds that are often OUT THE DOOR- drinking here take forever and are often inconsistent. This location is TINY for such a populated area of the city. Secondly the staff here is very rude and often provides service with an attitude.
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2018-03-23,5,"Cool people!

Matthew has great customer service and always pleasant!!! Keep up the good work."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2018-02-22,1,"I never quite understood why people with attitudes seek service industry professions. I'm a reallyyyy nice person. I understand that the service industry is rough, therefore it takes a lot to trigger me when it comes to bad service. This Starbucks on the other hand irked my last nerve this morning. I went in to order a Grande Almond Milk. None of the cashiers were pleasant. In fact, none of them were even smiling. But whatevs, smiling may not be part of the job expectations. I place my order and wait to the side for it to be made. Mind you -- it was just a cup of almond milk. When my name is called, my cup of almond milk was given to me with 90% ice. 1. Who drinks watered down milk? 2. I know for a fact I didn't iced for ICED almond milk. So understanding the morning rush, I kindly ask ""Can I actually have this without ice?"" The gentleman behind the counter scoffed at the request and begin to fish out ice cubes with a spoon. Like bruh, you're making this more difficult on yourself. Like dump the cup (that's mostly ice anyways) and refill it with milk. It's JUST milk. Nothing crazy, nothing complicated. When he went to refill the cup, his co-worker asked what he was doing and he replied ""she didn't want ice."" His co-worker then responds ""WELL SHE NEEDS TO SPECIFY THAT."" Now, I'm hella triggered. But still extremely polite. Let's recap. When I ordered my almond milk, I asked for a Grande Almond Milk. Ya know, when you order a tea from Starbucks, you say ICED..if you want an iced tea. So I assume the concept would be along the same lines. IT IS MILK! It's not this crazy concoction. You literally pour it out a box in the fridge. This location is a hot mess. Save your sanity and walk right on by."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2017-12-19,4,This location is not meant for long chats and catch ups with your best friend.  This is a get your coffee and get moving high volume location which is great for NYC.  Baristas may not seem super friendly but they have a lot of orders to fill and half the time the line is all the way to the door so cut them some slack since they are trying to make your order correctly.  Katrina is barista there and she is great!
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2017-11-30,3,"It's Starbucks. Every aspect is aesthetically the same across the board.

Service is fast and mostly correct. This place has high customer volume due to it's location in Midtown.

Drinks are fine. Baristas can come off as rude but really they are rushed for time.

I'd stop in again."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2017-11-06,1,Awful location. Drinks take forever to come out and often are wrong. Baristas checking their cell phones instead of getting customers in and out fast. Go somewhere else.
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2017-09-04,3,"this starbucks on 6th ave between 35th and 36th st is famous for always having a crowd regardless what day or time and even on.a monday labor day holiday .it's small inside with no seating unless you consider the by the window counter as non seating . the usual bucky menu with hot and cold drinks , pastries , bagels , salads , sandwiches , etc. why it is that starbucks makes it a point to put a stand with mugs, coffee holders , bags of take home coffee grinds , etc , right in the middle of the interior were clumsy people (me) will bump into it and knock stuff over , maybe keep it behind the counter or against the wall might be better especially when space is limited when a large line is gathering . the folks working at this location are fairly quick and have not made a mistake whenever i put in an order so far.overall your typical manhattan starbucks with limited space and no seating but if you need space then the madison or 5th ave locations on 36th st will suit you just fine."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2017-06-21,1,"This is the worst Starbucks. There is one barista working, though others workers talking and ignoring long line.  No customer service."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2017-04-23,3,"Not much to say about this place. The staff is great. The best time to visit is definitely at night. In the morning and during the day the space gets super crowded really quickly. 

I'd give them a 4/5 for staff friendliness and helpfulness."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2017-04-22,2,"A Starbucks is a Starbucks. They always have good coffee and treats. However, this location is always crowded. The staff works hard to keep the flow moving but it can get very tight very quick. I have gotten the wrong order before, but the staff was very nice and fixed it right away. I have also recently tried the unicorn frappuccino. Def not worth it."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2017-04-10,1,"This is a convenient location for picking up a coffee as it's near big stores and many hotels. 
I've been in this Starbucks four times now. The second time, on 4/9 AM, the cashier was obviously having a bad day or maybe shouldn't work in customer service. 
Tonight , 4/10, the three people working were talking loudly about their personal life and making coffee was secondary. When I walked in, three people were waiting for their drinks. There was no rush, no consideration for the order in which drinks were placed. People got their drinks between the conversation. 
(I really hope I got decaf or little sleep for me tonight.)
Then the cashier decided to make the drink for the  last person to place an order after me. Why?
The barista, Scott, was talking so much, he didn't notice his co-worker made and handed the drink out. After he finally started my drink, he made the last drink ticket and tried to find the owner. I had to tell him the person and drink were already gone. He asked if we wanted it, we said no, so he threw it out. 
If you are the owner of this store, you might want to remind your workers of your expectations; hopefully that includes providing consistent, quality service and product as well as professionalism on the job."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2016-12-02,1,"Probably the slowest Starbucks in town.... more than 10min waiting for my bagel, When asking for it they again I was told they've run out of whole grain bagels(which I ordered). I then waiting another 10min for my plain bagel + they forgot about my pumpkin loaf... messy, unorganized and slow!!"
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2016-11-10,5,"The baristas are literally the nicest people in NYC.  Pretty busy, but never too long of a wait."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2016-07-01,1,"Yea, I have been here countless of times and now I know why people want to sue Starbucks lol... The workers are friendly whenever I visit, but the time I tried the Purple drink they make it really nasty! I do not recommend it, because they don't even follow the ingredients to make it.

The purple drink consists of passion fruit and some type of milk. They make it another way around, Idk why they would charge more for the blueberries when the drink is hella disgusting itself. 

The time I tried the Strawberry Acai for the first time, I had no problem with it. The second time I ordered a Venti in the morning, they did make it the correct way HOWEVER, they didn't fill it up all the way. Like, excuse me!! I paid for it and ya'll can't just not fill it up all the way -.-.... 

I only come to this Starbucks location, because It's close to the train station entrance and close to my work area. 
Please train your baristas please! Us customers don't want to pay $4-$5 for a disgusting ass drink or when it's not filled up all the way. 

This is the end of my rant. Thank you for reading."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2016-07-01,1,"Okay, before I begin this review I want to say I generally find it pointless to write reviews for chain restaurants where I am literally in the store for less than 10 minutes altogether and I'm mostly just in and out-- even if there isn't really any customer service, if the drink/food is what it generally taste like without any bugs or roaches, I would consider that a successful trip and money well spent.

Now, a lot of people have complained that this particular Starbucks tends to fill their drinks with ice and that is true. When I was done with my drink, I could see that half the cup was filled with completely solid pieces of ice (and I obviously can't see the cubes that have already melted). But, even that is tolerable and not worthy of writing a one star review for.

My friends and I came in on a super NOT BUSY, Thursday evening where we were the only ones in the store. Now, after seeing my photo you're probably thinking we're the annoying basic girls that every Starbucks barista hates because we're trying to order all sorts of colorful drinks.. BUT NO. We were very kind about it, even letting the cashier, Chyyy (I believe that was the name I saw on the nametag, definitely had three consecutive Y's though), hold my friends phone to read the recipe. Keep in mind that there were NO other customers in this store at the time (or during the entire time we were in the store-- even after all our drinks were completed). For one of my friends', this cashier decides to charge her twice.. claiming that her Starbucks card had no money. Confusing situation, she was rude about it.. Nevertheless, quick transaction and I was standing one person behind her.. So I guess I didn't understand the whole situation (except that my friend did indeed get charged twice, and the first time she typed in my friend's order wrong). Next friend went after her, fine. My turn, I made sure to be very friendly and gave her the recipe of the purple drink and she didn't hear me the first time so I repeated for her.. when I repeated my order, she was just checking out her nails and not even putting in my order. When I saw the crazy stuff she was putting into my drink that I did NOT mention to her, I was kind of like uh.. wtf ?? But I'm no Starbucks expert and it was also my first time ordering the purple drink so who knows??

All in all, my first friend got her drink completely wrong.. what she ordered was a liquid drink and not a smoothie (but she got charged for the smoothie). The green tea latte came out fine. The pink drink was full of strawberries, they did not cheap out on that. The purple drink did not look at all like what the purple drink looks like in photos and just overall tasted absolutely disgusting. And all drinks, excluding the smoothie, were full of ice.

And while I'm at it, this Starbucks has no seats for you to sit down and study at-- as you expect in many Starbucks that are actually in their own store and not a part of Macy's or.. another store."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2016-06-17,3,"Small place, no seating.  Got my daughter's order completely wrong.  Made her go pay 54 cents more because they had not charged her for a big enough size.  Had to cut in line or wait to go through line again, that is bad business.  How about, it you get the order wrong, you make it right and write the 64 cents off for not charging for the correct size."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2016-06-09,4,"Visited here twice while on vacation in NYC. The Baristas were friendly, made eye contact, smiled, and made our drinks quickly and accurately!
The clientele seemed to be rather cranky... maybe that's an NYC thing or they just all needed coffee, but every one of them looked miserable! LOL!! 
It is a cramped location, but a positive attitude makes life better so lighten up and enjoy life!"
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2016-04-21,1,It takes 15 minutes to pour a black coffee. Do not come here during weekday morning rush  #productivityfail
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2016-03-12,1,"I wanted to give this Starbucks more than just a star. But I've had enough of the overpriced cups of ice.

If I ever order a refresher, it's a strawberry acai. I ask for NO ice, and for extra strawberries (because if you don't ask for some more, you'll get one or two small pieces.) I don't think it's that hard to make. Yet it takes them a long time. (Just 1 customer in front of me, none behind me, and it took the entire 15 minute break I had to get my drink.)

Your order will be 80% ice. I remind the barista, and it's still full of ice. The drinks are already expensive, why do they have to put so much ice. I can't stress this enough. This is actually the reason why I'm even writing this review. I've given them way too many chances, and I still get a cup of ice. If the new star system went by how much ice you receive, I'd be eligible to stay a gold member til 2064.

95% of the time the cashiers have an attitude. Only two people that work there are nice. And I know I'm not the only one who believes this. All of my co-workers believe this. The rest of the sour Starbucks crew needs to print out a smile and glue it to their face for their shift. Not everyone who is ordering is being an uptight, angry human demanding their order to be precise. If my order has a mistake..fine. But if this happens ALL THE TIME, I just can't handle that. It gets annoying.

And I hate the new points card system. Spending more to stay gold member? Aside from getting cup loads if ice, this new system is also irritating. :(



*one star because I occasionally get the barista that's friendly."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2016-02-08,1,"Worst starbucks customer service so far. Unfriendly, indifferent staff. Staff talk to each other while taking an order from a customer."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2016-01-26,3,"The cashiers and barista are always friendly at this location. The only issue is the space, it gets crowded quickly.  As far as the coffee and lattes you really can't go wrong with Starbucks unless they have a rogue agent."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2015-12-15,1,"I had some unpleasant experience at this location.

I always try to visit other location either one in Manhattan mall or one in Macy's Starbucks. They are excellent."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2015-11-02,1,"Weak to indifferent customer service. Didn't have carry out trays, one didn't even know which urn had the dark roast. In the world of Starbucks this place is near the bottom"
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2015-10-08,1,"Wish I can give this Starbucks no stars! Horrendous customer service. No proper greeting. They snap at you when you don't say your order exactly as it's written on the board. Somehow they get extremely confused. And for some reason, the customers behind me ALWAYS get their drink ahead of me while I wait patiently. Some people should not be in the food or customer service industry and those employees are prime examples."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2015-09-07,1,There should actually be no star for the customer service at this location. There were four workers behind the counter and one pair of customers in front of me and yet it took forever for those ppl to even order from this one girl at the register.  Obviously other ppl have encountered the same terrible service. More and more starbucks seems to have liwer quality standards for their employees and for that more and more reason to go to non-starbucks for my expensive coffee.
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2015-09-06,1,"Can I give it a lower rating? The worst staff ever! Absolutely the worst! I walked up to the cashier and said hello. She stood in complete silence and stared at me and did not utter a word. Obviously, I stared at her and did not place my order, until she was forced to greet me. It was a simple iced coffee, which they managed to screw up. By the way, that's the only sort of management going on at this place. The entire staff behaves like the only reason they are at work is because their families are held hostage and would get hurt, if they didn't show up to this Starbucks. Maybe it's true! In a crazy way, I'm OK with it, because I will demand a smile and a properly made drink from the Starbucks Corporation, even I have to fight for it!"
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2015-07-31,1,"Terrible customer service with very unhappy employees. I asked for my iced espresso in a Grande cup and they gave me a tall which was fine (an honest mistake), but when I asked to put it in a grande cup, the lady spoke back to me under her breath with an attitude. Today, this guy ordered 6 drinks, he asked for a tray, said they didn't have any and proceeded about their business and ignored him. He stood there for a while, then asked for a bag, the guy ignored him, but finally another lady responded."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2015-06-25,3,"Sigh. I'm not sure why Starbucks chooses to eben have these teeny tiny outposts. This starbucks is close to my freelance gig, so I'm a regular but its so small and so tight inside. Because of that I avoid it durinng rush hour because its a mad house. 
On off hours or before 9a.m. its not as bad and they're usually pretty good with getting your beverages in a timely manner.
They l
Also usully have pastries, ect. In stock when the starbucks on Broadway usually doesnt.
Go if you need to, but only dirong ""off"" hours."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2014-07-19,1,I thought I was the only one.  Should of checked the rating here.  Just 30 mins ago I asked for espresso frappechino.  Got it with no whip cream because they ran out. Taste my drink and it was more water then coffee.  Asked for a new one because it was watered down and changed it to caramel because there's no whip cream. Got my caramel and it was still watered down.  If I want late for work I would have exchanged it again.  Terrible.
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2014-05-27,1,"WORSE STARBUCKS EVER!! 

Inconsistent drinks, WORSE ATTITUDE/RUDE PEOPLE, always forgetting my drinks.
wth I'm paying x amount of money for fckin coffee, do you really need to throw in the attitude.. They need to check this starbucks because there are some rude people that talk about customers, I remember one time the workers were talking about a customer that just had ordered and the customer was still standing there. 

Today I wanted to order coffee and they didn't have anything..... ANYTHING AT ALL
all they had was iced frap. seriously..."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2013-12-26,2,They seem to be understaffed frequently and the drinks are a bit inconstant. One of the worse Starbucks I've been to. The employees don't really seem to care very much. I might have to start walking a couple extra blocks to get a better latte.
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2013-10-10,1,"Worst service, fucking slow. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like a plague."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2013-08-10,1,"Some people here are total assholes. Honestly, do you really need to glare at someone for asking for a splash of soy milk in their iced coffee? Wait, and then you want to charge me for asking for about 1 tablespoon of that subpar quality soy milk? (What the hell is with Starbucks discontinuing offering free soy milk substitutions for gold card members anyway?)

Oh, and why are you hissing at me when your own cashier forgets my order? You should be thanking me for reminding you to do your unskilled job.



That is all."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2013-05-04,3,"This Starbucks is located around Herald Square, quite close to Macy's and Victoria's secret. It's a small store and I don't like waiting in here very long - for the most part they spare me the wait."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2013-04-21,1,"How hard is it to get a customer's order correct? After having worked at Starbucks for a year myself, not that hard! They couldn't remember what my friend and I ordered and kept making the wrong thing when all we had asked for is a soy latte. Completely disorganized and staff had no idea what they were doing- and didn't care."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2013-04-13,2,There are bar tables but no seats available anywhere. Very grab and go style...never seen that at a starbucks before. I don't like it but I guess it's good for a quickie. Big place for no seats though.
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2013-02-13,2,"This Starbucks is consistently bad. If you order food, you will almost always have to order it twice.  Service is very erratic and this equates to long waits, even when the line is short. Just do yourself a favor and walk half a block to the Starbucks on broadway and 37th where they go so far to even remember your name (even after not going in there for months!)."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2013-02-11,1,"I've been to this starbucks about 6 times.  If I go midday, the wait time isn't bad, the staff is friendly and I'm generally happy with my drink.

If I go in the morning, then they don't seem to do as well.  Today I went around 10 am.  I always get the venti chai tea latte.  

You should know this Starbucks is very disorganized.  The line moves quickly to order your drink, but then to get your beverage is chaos. They don't seem to be smart like other Starbucks.  They do not ask your name which makes sure you get the right order.  No one wrote the order on a cup and put it out. There was no print out to put on the cup to help the people that make the drinks.  The cashier didn't give me a receipt and went right to the next person, not allowing me to ask for a receipt unless I wanted to seem pushy or rude.  So I go to the corner and wait for my drink.  After a while of waiting and  noticing everyone else that came in after me was getting their drink when I still didn't have mine, I went to the counter. The guy there was asking people what they were waiting for and then making it.  This is RIDICULOUS and very UNORGANIZED.  When I pay more for a coffee drink than I do for my salad at lunch I expect not to have to fight the crowd for my drink.  Finally told them I hadn't gotten my drink and got  one of the crappiest chai tea lattes I've ever had. The taste and temperature were both off. The staff is rushing around and borderline rude.  


Ironic how bad it is considering they have more staff behind the counter than other Starbucks I've frequented.  Go to any other Starbucks!"
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2013-01-30,3,"This is a decent Starbucks. Most of the time, the employees are smiling and the service is quick. But occasionally, especially during the morning rush, they can get muddled up, forgetting drinks, and letting the line stretch to the door and then some.

No complaints - it's a typical Starbucks! No better, no worse than the rest."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2012-10-16,1,"Worst Starbucks experience I've ever had. I waited 20 minutes for the completely incorrect drinks. They claimed they ""lost my tickets"" with deadpan faces. The apology couldn't have been less genuine. Absolutely took their sweet time. It's across the street from my office and I will not be returning."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2012-07-18,2,"If does not matter what time of day you go or how many people are on line in front of you: you WILL wait a long time.

Each time I go there, it's a 10-20 minute feat. Yes, even that time when there were only TWO customers in front of me. It's faster to go to another Starbucks further away than wait on line here."
38,starbucks-new-york-443,2012-01-28,3,"New Starbucks right across from my apartment that just opened last week. The interior for some reason seems more luxurious than other Starbucks around the city. Maybe because it's fairly new I guess? The barristas/cashiers were attentive and they do a good job with drinks. However, despite the pretty large-looking store from outside, this particular Starbucks does not have seats for customers to sit down and enjoy the drinks so takeout is the way to go here. But I'm glad a Starbucks opened up near my crib!!"

39,dunkin-new-york-88,2019-10-19,1,Worst Dunkin Ever!!! I come in with my friend to order food and when I was paying with my card the cashier was being rude and speaking in her language talking shit! Then I waited 5 mins for my food and she's like why I'm still here ? Wtff how do you say that to your customers ! I told her I'm waiting for my food that I ordered!! Never again coming back to this nasty ass place!

Also what kid is walking into a store to buy their own ice cream without an adult if not a teen ! Then I was forced to buy a small scoop which was double the price also I find it funny that they were giving me an issue when for the birthday scoop for everyone it's a KIDS SCOOP!!! Regardless this location is full of unprofessional petty employees and to add to complaint they were all heckling me when I did ask for a kids scoop ! I felt like telling them off but definitely not worth the trouble but I did call to complain . A bunch of idiots work there honestly"
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2019-04-10,4,"I live on the west coast and we don't have any DD's. The first time I tried one was in Vietnam...so I was really excited to see a DD literally everywhere. Did I try a donut? No because I was stupid. I did however try the chocolate cherry cold brew and that was damn tasty. You can't really taste the chocolate, it's pretty subtle but you could definitely taste the cherry after tone. Really enjoyed it, especially on a hot day. Refreshing!"
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2019-02-18,1,"How are you a Dunkin' Donuts with a broken
Macchiato machine for the past two weeks! Ridiculous"
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2018-09-23,1,I went in to order an ice cream sundae and the employee was on his phone and cleaning the plastic sneeze guard that blocks the ice cream. I said excuse me I'd like to order and he sent me to the Dunkin' Donuts counter. I then proceeded to ask her if I could have my Sunday she spoke to him in another language and said no it won't be ready for another hour because he's cleaning the case. He spoke back to her in another language. And flipped off the lights inside the ice cream holder. Terrible service. Will not be returning here and I will be writing Baskin-Robbins corporate. It's the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday -- not a time to clean.
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2018-08-30,1,They turn off their mobile ordering. Dunkin offers a promotion for 2x points if you use mobile ordering on Wednesday's but you can't here. They should probably get in trouble for that.
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2018-03-08,3,"This location gets a little crazy in the morning, but the staff are efficient and get your order out quickly. I recommend doing the mobile app because you can avoid the line and save so much time. As a tip, If you're new to Dunkin, beware of their swirl flavors if you don't like really sweet coffee. If you add a swirl flavor to their medium espresso drinks, it automatically comes with 4 pumps. I usually bring it down to 2 and even that is pretty sweet. Right now, this location is featuring Girl Scout flavor swirls. I recommend trying the thin mint or the coconut caramel. Oh so yummy. Happy sippin!"
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2017-12-29,3,"They are by-far the fastest serving coffee place in the city during rush hour.  
My dissatisfaction comes from a recent order for a holiday Baskin-Robbins cake, which I placed on-line & called to confirm.  While they had sufficient time to produce the order (4 days), they screwed it up completely.  I truly think there is something to be said for reading and understanding the English language when you run a business in this country.  I'll stick to purchasing Carvel in my local supermarket."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2017-11-24,3,"i will not knock this dd off 5th ave and 43rd st cause they carry baskin robbins besides the usually dd stuff so grabbing a few pints of ice cream for the crew at work will put a smile on a few lazy faces. the interior is spacious with plenty of room to sit at one of the tables against the walls. its busy on a friday morning and 3 three folks working behind the counter i did not wait long.  the full display of donuts are starting to get lower as more folks come in. now i understand the crowds as i am walking out, plenty of big office buildings around.  3 stars on my yelp meter."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2017-10-04,1,"Would probably have given a 4, since this is the closest location and I have been going here. But today is just utterly disgusting. Ordered a Chicken Salad on a Croissant with American Cheese, paid with cash - and mind you, HE WAS WEARING HIS GLOVES when he accepted my payment and gave me my change. I was watching him as he went straight and prepared my order and another guy's order, USING THE SAME GLOVES. Saw him placed an American Cheese in a Croissant and..that's it. he told me that was my order - I guess he did not hear my ""Chicken Salad on a"". I do not have the energy to argue with him so I just left.

About to eat what he made and hopefully to not get sick, since I do not have the time to get something else."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2017-09-30,4,"Crazy busy location especially if you come during rush hour!! Save yourself some time and use the app to order to go. The staff works incredibly hard and be sure to listen for your order when they're done. 

I've had no problems with this location so far. Consistent and reliable. They take coupons for Dunkin and baskin!"
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2017-08-30,1,Horrible experiences at this dunkin if you can avoid it don't  come here. It's always busy they don't know what they are doing. They will mess your order up least half the time and place is dirty. Garbage is always over flowing and floors are dirty. Avoid this location if you can.
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2017-08-22,4,"Great location for me since it's right next to my school, and I always come to capitalize on the Dunkin coffee/food deals or the Baskin ice cream scoop deals. The people working behind the counters are always friendly and work very quickly, and it's nice that I get the student discount here on a regular basis (haven't experience that at other Dunkins in NY, really)."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2017-07-09,5,Came here for the Baskin-Robbins ice cream. Got a super huge scoop for my order. Big enough to share with my friend. It was tasty. Thank you for being so generous!! Would definitely come back for more ice cream
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2016-10-18,1,"This is also a Baskin, as I just requested Yelp update on the listing. Though service is fast, they ignore mostly everything you say, including the Regular Scoop freebie text I had, instead insisting on a Kids and refusing to upsize to the proprer one, plus the dark chocolate oreo special flavor had huge hard chunks."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2016-07-10,1,"Everything was terrible

Pretzel was served cold and was very hard.

Frosted donuts somehow had no frost(ing)....and were also stale.

Will not be back here again."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2016-07-03,3,"For a Dunkin, they were pretty busy. They were also pretty slow for what I'm used to. However, it is Dunkin and I'm forever loyal."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2016-05-25,4,"Im adding a star to my review. Ive had issues in the past with not getting decaf which i need due to a heart condition which doesnt allow me to have any caffeine. Ever since I spoke to the manager I havent had a problem. 

Service is always quick and accurate no matter how long the line."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2016-02-23,4,"lines are usually quick, they get my order right and they use the app without an issue.  I like it here and they have Baskin ice cream too.  Excellent"
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2015-12-02,1,"Rude, rude, rude! When in the service industry wouldn't it make sense to be just a little nice to your customers rather than roll your eyes when they walk up to the register to purchase a birthday cake.  Birthday cake was already in hand.  The purchase is about $49... which is significantly more than a cup of coffee. Unfortunately, it's one of the closest places to the office to get ice cream cake..."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2015-11-05,1,"They don't even deserve one star. I work the next block over and came twice for coffee. I am lactose intolerant and strictly ask for coffee, black, no sugar. Can you guess what they give me both times, coffee with cream and sugar....

The staff can't even speak English and repeat my order 5 times. Repeating the order back to me is barely in English. 

Not sure how you run a business like this. 

Terrible. 

Stay away."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2015-08-13,1,Idk if this girl was new or what but how hard is it to understand what a number 9 is? Know your menu!
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2015-06-17,1,"If I could leave less stars I would.

I ordered a cake online and requested ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHLOE"" to be written on the cake.  When I picked it up, it said ""SHLOE""
They tried to take off the ""S"" but you could still see the ""S"".  And they didn't have red icing to fix it, so it was fixed in orange.

They still wanted me to pay for the difference (I ordered a smaller cake but called for the next size up)

But what is the most frustrating is the BIG attitude I got from the store employee who didn't care about anything.  And the store manager wouldn't come out to talk to me.

I tried reasoning with her, asking her how'd she feel if she got a birthday cake from her coworkers with her name spelt wrong.  It'd look like they don't care.  I asked to talk to the manager and she replied, with her hands in the air, just take the cake!  Didn't package up the cake.  Didn't say sorry.  Didn't care at all.

THIS PLACE IS THE WORST."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2015-04-05,1,"I came here a few years ago and had a bad experience. The workers there got my order wrong twice before they actually gave me the right thing. The service was cold and the store did not appear to be too clean. I returned after about 2 or 3 years because I was desperate for breakfast. I was praying that the store shaped up a bit and I proceeded to order two egg and cheeses on an English muffin. I received my food fairly quickly and I began to eat it inside the store. However, then I was called over again to be handed another two egg and cheese sandwiches which I had not ordered. The lady appeared to be very confused and kept trying to shove the food in my face. After she finally understood that I did not want the surplus sandwiches, she returned to back where I caught her dismantling the sandwich and putting the ingredients back for later use. I was so disgusted that I spit my food out of my mouth, tossed it into the trash and stormed out of the store. It has come to my conclusion that this specific store is operated by Satan and requires an FDA agent accompanied by religious leaders to cleanse the establishment of any unsafe food and unwanted supernatural beings"
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2015-02-21,3,"Honestly I came here just because I am tired of people talking about how good D & D coffee is... and I wanted to get it over with. 

With a rash of Dunkins sweeping through L.A. - It still seemed easier to just go to NYC - where they are everywhere. 

Truth is, it is good coffee. It is certainly above average fast food style coffee around. But not as good as craft coffee on the west coast. 

Donuts are whatever."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2014-08-04,4,"So, my office building doesn't have very good coffee and it gets difficult for me to get through the day without one or two or three or four cups of coffee at times. There are two starbucks across the street from my building. One is tucked in the foyer of another office building and the other is across the street from Bryant Park. Both have lines out the door everytime I pass by. So it may be a little further walk, but this Dunkin Donuts/Baskin Robbins is great for me. 

I walked in and was so mystified by the sight of no line I forgot my usual order and I had to ask the workers to give me a second to think about it. I ordered just a regular medium iced coffee and hash browns because I had already eaten lunch but was craving something fried. 

The order came to me so quickly. But alas, my coffee has way too much sugar in it. I have to always remember to just ask for milk because every Dunkin Donuts puts way too much sugar in it and I'd rather do it myself.

This location also has seating in the back and you can get your baskin robbins as well. Plus, if you do not wish to wait in line for a half hour at Starbucks, this is a much better place for you."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2014-07-08,1,"I am big fan of Dunkin Donuts. I like their coffee and donuts; however, the coffee I received from this place is below subpar.  I can actually see small particles floating on my coffee. I believe they used a poor quality cream."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2014-06-13,1,"What a lousy place to come first thing in the morning - these women that work here are snobby, snooty, rude, and disrespectful. I honestly just want to slap the crap out of her for being so rude. I simply asked what the flavors of drinks were and she answered me ""WHAT??!"" And then i said ""i don't see the drinks on the menu"" and she just ignored me once i was rushed into making a decision, she rang me up and BEFORE handing me my card back she yelled ""NEXT CUSTOMER!!!"" 

After that the other lady got my drink wrong after not knowing who the hella drink it was.

Summary - this place sucks! I will never return here and its sad because i work 300ft away and they could have had a loyal customer - yes i will tell everyone i know to go to Crave's a couple feet down the sidewalk."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2014-02-28,1,"They always have a long wait for small coffee orders. While waiting that long for your order, most of the time you have to remind them what your order is and when that's done, they have given you someone else's order or made the worst cup of coffee ever. 

There service is pretty bad. The ladies in the front don't even greet you or smile, what kind of customer service is this ? They never give you receipts and want to keep the line moving without keeping track of orders. Very disorganized! 

I have just come back with the wrong latte and don't have the energy to go get a new one or replaced one. This happens a lot which means I won't be going here for a while. 

Management needs to be replaced!"
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2014-02-19,4,"I frequent this DD location at least twice a week because it is so convenient to my school, so I may be a little biased. The service is always super quick. In and out in 5 mins, even when the line is to the door. They now offer soy milk for your coffee drinks, which I appreciate. Very happy with this location. Never had any problems with my orders either."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2014-01-16,3,"This Dunkin is right across the street from me.  It's always crowded and yes, sometimes the line can be out the door.  The good thing is, the service is so fast that I'm usually in and out in about 5 minutes.

I liked that this location has soy milk at times.  Just be sure to ask for it clearly.  One thing that bugs me here is I usually have to repeat myself 2 or 3 times because the person ringing me up doesn't pay attention.  It's pretty annoying.

Since I've started to become super lactose intolerant and more sensitive to sugar, I've started to limit my Dunkin intake so I only stop by when I forget to bring my own breakfast to work.

The service is much better than starbucks and they treat their regulars really well.  Make friends with the right people here and you will be treated like gold."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2013-09-30,4,"I think the guys working here are reading some of the negative reviews on Yelp because I thought they seemed really friendly and service was pretty quick. 

I was surprised to see that there were more seats available in the back and that most of them were filled. I think its great that there is sitting space here. Most cafes around Bryant park don't have adequate space for seating. But I guess its considerable because there are great outdoor seatings in Bryant park."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2013-08-06,2,"I work in the building and was so happy when this DD opened up.  I prefer grabbing something from a different coffee shop, but I'm often pressed for time in the morning and this is right there!

However, the service here is awful and has not gotten better.  They treat you like you're infringing on their time by being a customer, don't understand (literally) half of what you ask for, don't seem to understand what's on their own menu, and they don't even try to listen to you.  They shuffle you from one person to another, often not communicating with each other, and just about every time I'm at this store, the register people are having conversations with each other while I'm trying to order.  They actually ask what your order is and as soon as you open your mouth to tell them, mid sentence they'll turn and start having a (clearly) non work-related conversation.

Additionally, they also screw up your order half the time and then act like it's your problem.  I would guess it's because they don't understand your order to begin with - mainly because they just flat out don't listen to the customer.

I've worked in a busy city coffee shop, and I understand it's not all smiles all the time, but I expect a little better than this. Barring a couple of good employees, they don't even try, and it's really apparent."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2013-07-01,1,"Zero stars would be more apropos for this specific DD at 43rd between 5th and 6th Avenues.  The cashier, Maria B. per the receipt, slaps the receipt in your hand and doesn't even make any face contact.  The entire staff, it seems, is busy chatting away and not treating the customers with any common courtesy.  Sadly, it seems most of the servers are not from the US but they sure have assimilated well to NYC attitudes."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2013-05-08,4,"Dunkin Donuts has good coffee. I don't drink coffee.

Dunkin Donuts has donuts. Eh, mine was all right. Nothing to write home about. Maybe I just picked badly? I had the vanilla iced sprinkle, which had sprinkles on half the donut (intentionally). Recommendations for better varieties?

I ordered a hot tea. This is the first place in America that's offered milk and sugar without me having to ask, and without having me to endure strange looks. And it was a great cup of tea. A Lipton tea bag, but it was a great cup. Milked and sugared just right!"
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2013-05-06,4,"Service is generally quick here, I never have to wait long in line even when there are a few people ahead of me and the standard dunkin fare can be found.  This location has more variety in donuts and bakery items than some of the smaller locations.  Sometimes you have to repeat yourself, which can get frustrating and sometimes they don't listen to you and make what they think you said, so speak clearly, but you can expect that at almost any dunkin in NYC."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2013-03-05,3,"I just left a Dunkin Donuts, and once again I satisfied with my coffee. I am a addicted to coffee consuming Dunkin Donuts coffee about 1-3 times per day. When I am on the road traveling, I visit many different Dunkin Donuts locations. I have discovered that my coffee tastes exactly the same from one franchise to another.  Anywhere I go I love that I can always rely on Dunkin to get me through the day."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2013-01-04,3,Very new location. It's pretty convenient but like most chains that you can find in other boroughs this one is more expensive because it is in Manhattan. The donuts are more expensive and have less flavor. At least the flatbreads and hash browns are still tasty.
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2012-10-05,1,"bought a bow tie and was dry no taste and a bit hard it was crap, dunkin donuts use to be excellent many years ago and fresh and then started to taste like crap cardboard nowadays."
39,dunkin-new-york-88,2012-10-04,4,"a dunkin donuts down the street from my office. what more could this girl want?

well, i will tell you that today, I ordered a medium beverage and got back to my office to see the cup wasn't full. there were definitely a couple inches at the top and dunkaccinos don't need room for milk or anything so i think my beverage could have been filled further up!

nevertheless, i am sure i will be back for my caffeine boosts!"
40,coco-moka-cafe-new-york-2,2018-08-20,5,"This place is a life saver. I stop in here when I'm waiting for my train. It is located inside of Penn station in the NJ Transit area. It's at the top of the stairs in between tracks 10 and 11. I get smoothies when I come here and it tastes good and keeps me cool. Today I tried the mango peach, and it was pretty good.  It I like the raspberry mango much better. Had a different kind of flavor. 

The ladies in here are extremely pleasant and kind. Always ask how my day was. I'm very appreciative of that. I love this place and the ladies who work here are awesome. It's my NY Penn station Go To."
40,coco-moka-cafe-new-york-2,2017-04-11,4,"I agree that this place is an undiscovered gem: I went there earlier today, around 9:45PM, and was pleasantly surprised that they were still open and serving (yes, you'd think that, in the ""City that Never Sleeps,"" getting a decent cup of coffee that's not from a chain that shall remain nameless wouldn't be an issue, even at that hour, but you'd be wrong).
I've gotten coffee there before, and it's always strong and flavourful, just the way I like it; service is prompt and attentive, as well.
Just a couple of suggestions: they could make themselves more visible (I had forgotten all about them until I stumbled into the area, desperate for caffeine, after having no luck at another place); as well, they should have their hours of operation posted in a prominent location (I didn't see any when I went)."
40,coco-moka-cafe-new-york-2,2014-07-20,5,"Awesome coffee place! A little gem at Penn Station. Their smoothies are always tasty, and the frappes are delish. They also have a stamp card."
40,coco-moka-cafe-new-york-2,2014-01-08,4,"Apparently this place I've been calling Seattle's Best Coffee is called Coco Moka Cafe. This is the cafe next to the NJ Transit waiting area. They have chocolates, candy, drinks (coffee and tea), and overpriced bottled juices, smoothies, and other concoctions. There is a case of pastries-- I've had some and they are good. They also have Ten Ren iced tea. The people who work here are nice and pleasant, and it is convenient to have this next to NJT, so you don't need to go all the way across the hall."
40,coco-moka-cafe-new-york-2,2010-04-01,3,"A solid option for coffee and snacks around the NJ Transit boarding area. The coffee (Seattle's Best) is comparable to Starbucks' and similarly unremarkable. Even so, speedy service, cleanliness, and convenience make Coco Moka an asset for commuters."
40,coco-moka-cafe-new-york-2,2010-03-15,3,"Obviously nothing exceptional is likely to be found in or around Penn Station. But they serve Seattle's Best Coffee here, which I prefer to Starbuck's crap. By that I mean.. that I cannot stomach coffee as much as I like it, so SBC coffee mocha (moka?) et cetera mixes are far superior to Starshit. My drink gave me a nice kick in the butt before getting on NJTransit and Coco Moka has a few treats to tempt a weary traveler."
40,coco-moka-cafe-new-york-2,2009-07-05,2,"It ain't Starbucks.  Their brand is ""Seattle's Best""??  The coffee is just OK,  you can get as good from a street stand.  What was dumb is that you order a coffee with cream, the server says the cream is across on the counter and then gives you a generous cup with Zero room for the addition of cream or sugar.  So I pour a half inch of coffee into the trash container. As did another customer after me.  Not smart.  Not stopping again."
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2019-07-31,1,Horrible customer service.  They never get the order right. When you tell them they made a mistake they just argue with you.  It's better just walking the few extra blocks to avoid this Dunkin Donuts all together l.
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2019-07-15,1,"(STAY AWAY)‼
So went this location on (7/15/19) @29th street 3rd Avenue,and did not notice the collection of smelly homeless people sitting all over with their bags on floor and shoes,as they sat barefoot. Never will I ever go there again. Thank you Mayor Deblasio."
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2017-07-18,3,"This Dunkin Donuts location is alright depending on who makes your beverage. My go to drink is a black caramel swirl iced coffee which entails 3 pumps of the swirl of your choice. Sometimes I feel as thought they either add one pump of caramel or just put way too much ice. Also, workers seem to need a bit more training. Otherwise, their manager is nice and always gets my coffee right."
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2016-07-06,3,"I always say that very few chains / franchises vary in quality as much as Dunkin donuts. Dunkins vary in terms of service, cleanliness, food and drink quality, etc.

This one is actually pretty good. Coffee doesn't disappoint and the very few times I've gotten food it is fine as well.

This one can just be a little slow. Go just about every morning, sometimes it zips along while other times the line seems to take forever, even if it's just a couple people. I've noticed this is especially bad in the earlier morning (6-630)."
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2016-06-01,1,"There was a time these places actually made their donuts, but not any more. This store doesn't even carry all the types of donuts they make. And the recipes are cheapened for NYC so they don't taste as good as outside NYC.

Even when the donuts are stale they charge full price.

Open 24 hours the worst people in the hood hang out here.

If you go up until about 9:30 go across the street to the Mom and Pop bakery that's been there for years and taste fresh baked goods!"
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2015-10-28,4,"Who reviews a Dunkin? I do, apparently. The staff is just so nice at this location and never messes up your order. Also they actually know how to redeem the DD perks coupons. This is my favorite location in the city."
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2014-09-09,5,Staff is super friendly!  Been coming here for a few months and have never had any problems. My favorite dunkin hands down
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2013-12-13,4,"Not sure if anyone checks reviews on places like Dunkin' Donuts but for what it's worth, this is the best DD in the area in my opinion. Waaaay cleaner than some stores just a few blocks away and they had a fresh Boston Kreme in the late afternoon!!"
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2013-01-07,4,"My favorite coffee is their hazelnut coffee. Love going there in the morning. The staff there is very nice, and they crank out orders like there's no tomorrow. Every now and then I'll go get some munchkins (4 for $1, but if ure a cute girl unlike myself, u can get like 12132414 for $1 bc they just grab them with their hands and don't count)"
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2013-01-03,3,"As an east coaster who relocated to the west coast and is now back for a while, I'm thrilled to get back to my morning routine of stopping in at DD for my coffee. Most days it's just fine. 

However, there is one employee who is just awful. He doesn't seem to give a crap about the customers. I've had to ask him to please hand me my order which he's walking around with while chatting away with other employees. I've called him out on pouring me regular coffee instead of the french vanilla I ordered and paid for. I've had to repeat my order for him because he wasn't listening. 

All the ladies who work here in the mornings are fine. This guy -- obnoxious."
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2012-04-27,3,"This is actually a pretty nice Dunkin Donuts location. A few blocks away from where I work so it's easy to grab a late afternoon cup of hot caffeine, or iced coffee jolt when I need to take a quick break and get some air.
 
It still looks new and almost as if it had a facelift not too long ago. Clean and bright, with about 7 - 8 tables to sit at. Some coffee merchandise for sale, along with the normal selection of coffees, muffins, bagels, and donuts of course! 
 
As far as chain coffee houses go sometimes I do get a craving for Dunkin's coffee, and it actually tastes pretty good here. Also, now that I am watching what I eat and on a crazy diet (which is ridiculously hard being on Yelp!) I am inclined to try one of their egg white flatbread breakfast sandwiches. With the sandwich combo meals the coffee is included.  
 
No ATM at this location but it is open 24 hours. Seems like a busy spot as I always see people come and go as they walk by just to pick up coffee. The counter people are friendly here and know some of the regulars.    
 
Wait - there really is no Baskin Robbins here! Shocking! It's kind of nice to not have that in every Dunkin Donuts location. Just a good old fashioned DD by itself."
41,dunkin-new-york-27,2010-03-07,4,"I love DD's French Vanilla coffee. Some places suck at getting the sugar/milk ratio right. This place does it well. On top of that, they have ample, sun-filled seating that is perfect for people watching on a lazy afternoon."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2011-02-06,1,"What a dump!  When I rented an old house with my friends in college, we used to throw parties in the basement and I have to say that our set-up was more luxurious than Space 212."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2010-08-21,3,"So.....the downstairs part of Space is closed...forever? Im not sure.. 
The upstairs is still there though.
 Its become a really quiet lounge/bar.  
They still dont card and have come up with some really odd mixtures for drinks here..
I dont recommend the peach soju..it was not a happy morning after haha. 
Too many different liquids going on in that. 
Other than that, the prices arnt too bad, a little cheaper than the other spots in K-town."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2009-10-28,3,"The manager is awesome, very friendly and cool. The bartender is mad awesome. 

A very chill place to just kick back and drink.

However... The crowd is not the same, got a bit darker. That would be why its only three stars."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2009-08-26,3,"A good place to end a night on the way to the 33rd street path as the service is always friendly and they're open late.  Whatever the yougurt drinks have a sweet taste but a dangerous effect.

How much booze is actually in a shot of this stuff?  I dont think its a lot, but somehow I drink too much of it and pay for it in the morning.  If you see me around the city or Hoboken this week...I'm the guy limping around after my visit to Space last night and ensuing trip down the stairs.  Awesome."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2009-06-13,3,"So the entrance is really tiny.
You walk in and get stamped if you're under 21 and then you gotta walk downstairs... into that darkness... that's blasting Lil Wayne music. Awesome right? To top that noise, the DJ made it louder and fussed around with his iPod. Lil Wayne all night.

It made it hard for the waitress to hear our orders correctly. At least they didn't charge extra for the change and few gulps. Yeah, those waiter girls were pissed with our bajillion (count: three) requests, but at least she turned the volume down slightly.

Still was really hard to hear yourself think, and you gotta lean real close to hear what your party is saying.

Two bathrooms. Pretty decent condition. Soft toilet paper. No vanity glass.

Low sofas. These four-seater egg chairs and tables.

Really dark. Small candle. Should offer flashlight of some sort.

Greasy menu.

Complementary popcorn.

Did I mention the ground level section is decently-lit? I'll update this review when I get there.

Anyway, the yogurt soju tastes great :0)"
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2009-06-13,3,"It finally re-opened so I got a chance to go.

They really should hire a new DJ, and not play some music off of a ITunes set-list. (It was playing Lil-Wayne all night, with music so loud and sound proof walls, it's just impossible to even hear yourself think). It was just SO loud that they got our drinks wrong. When it's like that, you know it's just TOO loud. 

The yogurt soju was nice...I guess this was a place to go if there's no where else to go."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2009-06-03,4,"I actually like this place. I went with a group of friends on Memorial Day. Due to it being around 7:00 pm on a Monday afternoon, we were the only ones in there. The prices are a little expensive but the workers gave us a free bottle of soju. It's pretty much pitch black in there so make sure you bring a flash light to spot the butterfaces.  Also, props to them for playing Tupac."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2008-12-18,5,"does this place still serve drinks to the underaged?
i just want to know for someone's safety"
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2008-12-08,2,"The place is really really dark.  Nice and spacious.  Been there once on a Tuesday night (yes, very random, empty night to go there: The place was virtually empty).  This made for attentive service from the waitstaff.  This place seems like it would be good for groups of friends just wanting to relax and enjoy each others' company.
Nothing special at all about this place, but nothing bad either.
Edit: Been here on a Saturday night and it was still pretty empty.
Very young crowd here (teens, early twenties)"
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2008-08-06,3,"Space is like an alcoholic cafe. Tons of tables to sit at, complimentary popcorn, and you will be chatting the night away with some friends while sippin on some soju. Not going to get buck wild here but good spot to chillax and kick it in K-town."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2008-07-12,3,"Been here twice.  Both times it wasn't crowded.  Both times it was so dark I couldn't see my own hand.

Drinks are cheap.  Popcorn is free.  Decent if you are looking for a place to drink and you don't want to wait in a long line to get into a rooftop bar.  

If you ask them nicely and no one is there, which usually is the case, they will turn the lights on a little bit so you can make sure you are sitting with your friends.

This place is good for a big group especially if you don't want to be bothered by other people.  

I remember having Ginger Soju here and I liked it."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2008-03-12,3,"Koreatown. Yet another long dark staircase that we have to climb down that leads to something great. But this time, alas, it's not that great, just okay. 

Yes, dear friends, we have stumbled upon Cafe Space 212. When we came here on a Sunday night the joint was empty. I mean, the empty chairs outnumbered the members of our entourage. On the projected screen was the Jessica Alba classic ""Honey"", to the part where she is, and I have to use quotes because it's just too funny to use as a regular word, ""dancing"".  

It was great that it was empty that night, because we took refuge on the couches and pretty much laid down on them. I'm not talking putting our feet up, I'm talking full on near-sleeping mode. We were that relaxed. Too bad the couches had big holes in them. Holes big enough to lead Leonidas' army of 300 through.  That's how big they were.

The bathrooms were a whole other story. No soap. What I thought was soap that was in the soap dispenser was actually antibacterial gel. So I'm scrubbing my hands and there are no bubbles. The hell kind of operation was this?

I'll tell you what kind of operation: the kind that gave us big jugs of yogurt soju and free shots, compliments of the lonely bartender. Pretty good drinks I must say. But the decor, or lack thereof, is kind of a turnoff. That's not to say that we won't come back to get our drink on."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2008-03-10,2,"Space 212 was my first bar in the city. And despite the fact that I haven't been here in the longest time, it probably has been the place where I graced my shit-faced self the most in New York. With such a history between the place and I, there's no way I can write about this place coherently; I'm sorry.

10 reasons why I used to go to space

***
1) They never carded. Never. Ever. Ever. A very big deal when you're 18, new to the city, and want to drink everything in sight. 

2) Every Korean I knew had his or her pre-21st birthday party here. 

Reservations or not, Space has always been very accommodating the many times I've gone here. Space has two floors; the ground floor is  a private room that could arguably fit about 25- 30 people and the basement is the actual lounge area. There's about four or five small tables that could seat 5-6 people around, and there's also 3 groups of sofas and ottomans to seat parties of 10-15  people. I've never actually came here with less than 10 people, and even on their busiest weekends, we've always managed to score either the private room or one of the sofa groups. 

And so because Space is so good about taking large groups, it can also get really noisy at times. But this place is never packed. 

3) Maru was too cool for us. 

Maru has a cool bronze bell. Space has Christmas lights. Sometimes, it'll even go fancy and use a projector to show a movie. Once, it was Shrek (I kid you not) and once, it was a Korean movie with an extended brutal sex scene. 

4) Red Bar was too cool for us.

Red Bar is a quiet lounge with plush velvet sofas, revealed brick walls, and interesting art on the walls. But not to be outdone, Space got the Ikea furniture special going on. 

5) We were too lazy to go down to St. Marks for Yakitori. 

We pay a little more for a pitcher of beer than we would at St. Mark's, but we pay a lot less on the cab ride back home. 

6) Pretty cheap. 

Don't ask me to quote the prices. Yes, I've been here far too many times than I'd like to admit, but I don't actually remember being here. 

7) Korean food nearby 

Seriously, has there been a better combination than beer and galbi? Or hangover and sul-lung-tang? 

8) Yogurt soju.

I've never came to Space with a group of girls, always with a group of guys. Now, whenever a group of guys come, a group of girls come as auxiliaries. But this group of girls are divided into two camps-- the girls that drink beer (usually friends of guys) and girls that drink girly drinks (usually girlfriends of the guys). It's hard to find a place where you can satisfy both female camps for a cheap budget, and thus Space fills that niche by offering OB by the pitchers and yogurt soju by the jars.

9) I don't actually really know. 

10) I didn't know any better. 

*****

5 Reasons I stopped going to Space
****

1) I remember I was in the bathroom and realized, ""Huh. The toilet got chipped since two weeks ago."" 

Um.. yea. 

2) After having been to other places, I've come to the conclusion that this bar kinda blows. 

3) I got too old.

Not to say that I matured, but to say that I ... just can't sit there anymore without wondering why on earth I'm here again. 
 
4) Seriously? Space? Again? 

5) I believe the last time I was at Space, I actually accepted a ""No, she and I are over. You're the one I want. I want to start new with you"" confession from a boy who, despite being only 3 inches taller than me (and I'm not tall, folks), had consumed 12+  beers (we lost count) and 5+ shots of soju and was sweating ethanol as he told me that. Needless to say, it didn't work out  between us (I fondly call it my resume builder for the Special Olympics), and I just don't think I can walk into this place without hating myself for my stupidity. 



Quantitatively speaking, there's 5 more reasons why I should go to Space. Qualitatively speaking, I should be petitioning this place to be razed down and have salt thrown over. 

O Space. Thanks for some good times. Maybe I'll come by when I'm nearing mid-life crisis and I want to relive that all over again."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2007-08-04,3,"an extra star for having some of the most creative and memorable drinks in Koreatown!

yes, the patrons are underage... the food isn't restaurant-quality... the music varies from hip-hop to classic rock...it gets rowdy up in there...there's karaoke...most of the time- it is empty. but so what!?!? i want to go to a place in Koreatown where it's NOT packed or full of tourists. ah-thank-you. 

i first came here 2 years ago. my friend usually came here with her college buddies and suggested we try the place here. then- it WAS crazy busy (in the middle of spring and still freezing outside), full of laughter, dancing, music, and drinks clinking all over the place. we had a special server we call ""Unnie"" (korean for ""older sister) and she would bring us free Lemon Drop and Jolly Rancher shots... just for being ""cute"" to her. okay? whatev... thanks for the drinks! lol. for a whole month straight, i came here with more and more friends. most of us were all west-coasters, so a lot of the cocktail names were a total nostalgic experience for us. from ""Adios Mutherf*ckers"" to ""Washington Apple"" and ""Chocolate Cake""... i've never seen anyone in NYC consume these drinks EVER. it was so awesome... that it brought an imaginary tear to my eye sockets. 

sure it's not pristine and sexy (like most of the bars/lounges in Koreatown)- but the drinks are killer creative and fun. the servers and bartenders always give out free shots and drinks to those they favor... which always seems to be ME and the people i bring. haha. 

stop your whining and try the Yogurt infused Soju. it will change your life. i'm dead serious."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2007-04-12,1,"It's entertaining when the main bar of a bar/lounge has all these new hip upcoming liquor on their shelves shining in fancy lights yet the bartenders are busier pouring for the server station than paying any attention to the actual eager customers sitting infront of their face practically throwing money at them. 

That is my run on sentence for this place and I'm sticking with it.

Oh and don;t play Turbo's Happy Busday song in this day and age, person (me) was ready to slice your throats. You can give me 50 but not that song. NO!"
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2007-04-01,1,"The bar downstairs is dark and plays loud music. 
The crowd was rowdy and perhaps under-aged. I wouldn't go back on a regular night out. There are better bars in K-town where you can just sit and drink at tables. 
The space behind the stairs is good for big groups.
If you have 500 people and nowhere to take them, I'm pretty sure Space will have space."
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2007-02-14,2,"Ok, I'll review Cafe Space 212 just to balance Lily H's review; I've been here twice; first time around it was really packed, they were showing Lucky No. Slevin on one of the walls via projector and the music was okay, but second time I went there it was completely empty, with the exception of some guys who walked in a few minutes afterwards.... Drinks are cheap, constant refills of popcorn will eventually litter your table, and one good thing I liked 'bout this place was the Amaretto sour, very good. Plus the service wasnt bad.

I dunno, I guess I root for underdogs, but I'll still give 212 2 lonely stars. =("
42,cafe-space-212-new-york,2006-10-23,3,"If you want someplace completely empty, this place has been virtually uninhabited every time I've been there. Which is many. Not necessarily a bad thing. Some people use it as a work space, and if you ask them to turn the music off they will, because no one else is there. I keep thinking it will go out of business but I think it's associated with the bar downstairs so their accounts balance. It's a little odd because they serve alcohol due to the bar influence, and they don't have any food, so it's not what you'd expect from a cafe. Also the decor is a little mixed up, plastic chairs plus a homey lamp, I don't know how to describe it off hand but it's a tad confused decor-wise, though mostly it's got a consistent feel to it... i suppose because the lighting is somewhat dim and bar-like, and yet the chairs are white plastic and seem like they would belong in a differently lit place.

I stopped going here because it was weird to be sitting there with the one employee staring at you, and at one point this korean lady whom I think was the owner, started to hang around there in like, her sweatpants, and this made it even more awkward because she wasn't a congenial type or anything, though she didn't seem mean either, she kind of had the air of a boss watching over her small business and there was something stifling about it."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2020-02-02,4,"I placed an online order through the app and was expecting to have to wait a bit when getting there, but it was already ready for me and sorted into clearly marked signs by first name (A-G, H-L, etc) on the counter. I also didn't have to ask for the almond milk like at other locations; it was out on the bar with the other milks. No complaints!"
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2020-01-14,5,"I'm in the city today for a conference and I walked past the Starbucks. I needed a coffee desperately so I went inside and I was pleased to see such a robust and happening environment. 

The location is large and has ample seating. The perfect place to get some work done where to stop and relax if you're killing time. I love this location."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-11-07,1,"I have been to many Starbucks but this one got my attention in many ways!!!!! First them baristas fool around are backed up with mobile and inside orders! The one fixing my latte is playing with an elf hat and his hair is all over the place on top of our drinks.  Then he wipes his runny nose on his arms then closing your lid. Makes you want to throw up!!!The other barista is making the inside orders and as he is making the drink stops to rub his genital under his apron then continues with drinks and touches the lids. What a gross place i have experienced. You wait 10 min for your mobile order and they give you an attitude if they don't have it in time. No customer courtesy instead of bringing my latte over to mobile order section he calls out my name to pick it up over the hot expressive machine! Absolutely idiots!!!!! Laughing and making joke high -giving everyone and then touching the lids.
Where is the health department to see these jokers that serve coffee. Never again!!!!!"
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-10-17,3,"This Starbucks is clean, have very nice seating area. But the choice of food is very limited. The staff is more on a slow side and mixed my order few times"
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-10-11,3,"A fairly large Starbucks by NYC standards with many other locations tending to have very little if any seating - the layout is pretty good in that regard.

Located on 5 East 40Th St, it is in a good location but the same could be said of many of the other 200+ locations they have around Manhatten, there truly is one on every other block - they'd probably put a Starbucks in a Starbucks if they could!

The service was average - drinks were a little slow to be made and the staff didn't stand out.

They did have a decent selection of merch and I did enjoy my drink - it was my first time ordering a Venti Iced Caramel Cloud Macchiato, a drink made with eggwhites which we don't have back in the UK - like most US Starbucks it was pretty pricey though, after tax it came to $6.48!

The music did seem pretty loud in-store, this does seem to be popular at many NYC locations but I just don't like it - for the few moments there was no music and we finally had peace, it was ruined by a rowdy customer shouting for more music which the staff didn't seem to be able to control.

3* - Pretty solid Starbucks, it actually has ample seating and my drink was good."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-10-02,1,"I've had better experience at other locations throughout the city!

So a male employee with the name tag 'Ty Jigga' tried to embarrass me while at the register. 

Here's the scenario:  A fellow co-worker was thoughtful to treat me to coffee earlier this morning. You see, I was in a conference call all morning and the coffee was cold by the time I got to it. The order was wrong (I asked for iced, not hot).  
When I arrived at the location and explained what happened, the cashier stated ""Oh, you're just now noticing that your order is wrong?"" loudly in front of everyone. Needless to say, it quite embarrassing to say the least. To add to that, I could hear other Baristas talk sh*t about what I said.

I'm scared to drink my newly made drink, as I don't know if it's tainted :(

This is the second time I've had to deal with disrespectful customer service from Baristas and ran into issues at this particular location!!"
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-09-05,4,"In general I don't set my expectations high for any coffee chain, but I was pleasantly surprised when I first came to this new Starbucks, and it's in midtown near the Fifth Avenue Library

The baristas are always quick and accurate it is large and clean area both an odd L shape layout with a small door way  is structured in a methodical way with space for waiting customers that aren't stepping on each other's feet.

All I know is that this a wonderfully hidden Starbucks built next to the hotel. It is far better than the other Starbucks that was here before hotel construction"
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-08-28,5,"A new spanking Stark bucks on 40th Street as part of the Courtyard by Marriott on Fifth Avenue. Cool interior with lots of space , places to sit and work. 40th is a low traffic street because most people turn on larger Fifth Avenue to where ever they are going. It has nice newly trained staff with big smiles and happy faces."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-06-23,5,Nicest baristas ever!!! They were so kind and made great drinks. One of the best Starbucks I've been to :)
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-06-10,1,"I agree with all the comments about the staff.  I get my morning coffee here almost every day because this is the only convenient location on my way to work.   Customer service is bare minimum, not even.  I can live with the the cashiers not smiling and giving you a feeling that you are a nuisance, but, at a minimum, I expect to be served fast.   All I get every morning is tall pike.  Cashier accepts the order and yells to the back crew ""tall pike""   - sometimes they hear her, but usually due to ""the important"" conversation that are being held by the crew, they don't hear her or just take their sweet time.   Today was again the case, and the second cashier asked ""what is she waiting for?"".  Mind you I was the only customer at that time.   Well, there are plenty of other coffee shops around."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-06-01,1,"AVOID THIS STARBUCKS AT ALL COSTS. This is the most disappointing Starbucks location I have ever been to. As a longtime and loyal gold card Starbucks customer I am shocked. There is ample seating and the shop is much bigger inside than it looks from street view. That is the only good thing about this location. The employees are unbearable and openly rude to customers. The drinks are inedible. The employees/baristas should all be replaced or at least reprimanded and reminded of their responsibility to treat all customers with respect and kindness. 

I just visited this location earlier this morning (9am EST on Saturday, 6/1/19) because this location is right next to my hotel. As I was ordering the employee taking my order was rude and dismissive to me. All I ordered was a sweet cream cold brew and an order of the red pepper vegetable egg white bites. First the egg bites came out - they were not the ones I had ordered. There were chopped up pieces of ham in them. I went up to the counter and politely informed an employee that I had ordered the vegetable egg white bites and received the wrong ones. I was told that the ones I were given did have red pepper and Starbucks doesn't offer red pepper egg white bites without ham. That is 100% false. I order them all the time at my local Starbucks in Texas. I ended up throwing away the egg bites because I cannot eat ham and I didn't want to argue with the already seemingly irritated employee(s). 

I sat back down and waited for my coffee. I was observing the employee/customer interactions and was appalled by what I saw. One customer received his order and mentioned something to an employee to which she responded ""You ordered half and half so I gave you half and half. You never asked me for an extra shot so you won't be getting an extra shot."" The customer just stood there for a moment and then walked away and left. The employee who made that comment then rolled her eyes dramatically and yelled to another employee across the shop ""Is it 2:00 yet??"" and they both laughed. Turns out the employee who uttered those 2 rude and defensive remarks was the manager on duty. (I later heard her telling certain employees when they can & can't take their breaks). 

Onto my coffee. The sweet cream cold brew is my usual order and I am always happy with it - until today. My order was called and I took a sip. It tasted like water. I took two more sips and decided that I couldn't drink it. I went back up to the barista who had taken my order and said ""I'm so sorry, I never complain - but this tastes like water. I can't drink it."" His response was a simple ""Okay so what do you want me to do?"" I asked for them to please remake the drink for me. After an eye roll and delivering an agitated look at not one, but two other employees he didn't even respond to me. Another barista remade it for me. I picked up the cup and before the coffee even reached my mouth he said ""So is that better?"" Again, it tasted like water. I was frustrated, I could see all employees staring at me and giving me attitude so I just asked for a black tea instead. They slid it across the counter to me. I picked it up and I left. 

I have worked in customer service at a very well-known & reputable national hair blow dry salon for 8+ years. I understand how difficult it can be to please every customer but I also realize how crucial it is to the success of a business. I cannot even fathom treating a customer at my shop the way I was treated by almost all employees/baristas at this shop. I'm so disappointed, it was a dreadful start to my day, and I will absolutely be contacting corporate regarding my experience at this location."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-05-26,1,"Staff is horrible.. Its morning rush hr, I can clearly see more than 5 staff members but only 1 mixing drinks and 1 working the cashier while the rest just hang around chatting... took a good 10 minutes to get my ice coffee (no fancy mixed drink)"
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-05-20,1,"Workers are unprofessional. They held up the line as they were deciding who will take on the register. Also when they gave me a tall instead of a venti, one of the baristas was clearly laughing at my expression. Am in a playground or what?"
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-04-12,1,"I don't understand why these baristas are rude and mean. I wouldn't mobile order if I didn't need to, I needed to rush to work. I ordered at 8:08am on Monday 4/08/19. I got there within a few mins of ordering and I can see that it was busy but not that crazy. There was a barista in charge of giving the people's order, their mobile order. I didn't see my name so I gave it a few more mins, knowing I'm going to be a little late which was fine. You can check the security camera if you think I'm bullshitting. I ordered a GRANDE, LIGHT ICED COLD BREW WITH SWEET CREAM! I have a screenshot of that too! GRANDE! I waited and then I asked the girl that was in charge of passing customers drinks, she then asked her barista friend name IMAMI, they said the machine was broken and asked me what I ordered, I said ""Grande Sweet Cream cold brew light ice""-so I waited a little more.

After a few more minutes went passed, I asked again, one of the barista guys called out a name, which yes was my name but that was a VENTI regular Iced coffee with no creamer no nothing. IMAMI then asked if that was my name, I said ""yes that's my name but that's not my drink"" I continued saying ""hold on"" while grabbing out my phone and looking at what I ordered just in case if I ordered it by mistake. While I was grabbing my phone looking for it, I didn't even take long, probably like a few secs less than a minute. IMAMI then told him to ""go back and move on and continue to work"". My order was correct and I told the girl in charge of passing customers drinks that that's not my order and showed her. She told IMAMI, and IMAMI straight lied saying ""she said it was"" I told them I never said it's my drink I said that's my name but I don't think that's my drink. She then said I did say that why am I saying something else and I told them I said to hold on but you guys kept moving. She then talked back with her rude ass self saying ""do you want your drink or not?"" I said yes but I never said any of what you just said and don't make up stuff. She then kept saying something. I waited even longer, she knew I was waiting too. Never said sorry never even mentioned my drink was done. A few more minutes went passed and I was fucking late for work. The girl IN CHARGE OF THE FUCKING mobile orders didn't bother checking. So then I asked again and IMAMI said it's right there. So I was waiting longer than I should when it was already done and no one bothered to tell me while I was staring at all of them."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2019-01-25,1,"If I could give -5 I would. I come here often since it's close to my office in New York and have gotten the same barista making the drinks twice already (Marcos). I've never met a person in such a foul mood all the time - slams down and slides drinks at people, he has nothing nice to say or even a fake smile to offer.
A few weeks back I was there with my family and he was so incredibly rude and disrespectful to me in front of my daughters all because I kindly brought up to him that what he gave me was not what I ordered. He literally hissed at me and mumbled the whole time he was remaking the drink. Then he slammed it on the counter and then slid it at me to where it almost spilled all over me. I asked to speak to the manager who was completely unapologetic and did nothing to remedy the situation other than say ""I'll talk to him""
Obviously, the manager did nothing about it since one month later, the barista is still there with the same nasty attitude. I called Starbucks customer service twice and was told the district manager would call me to which I'm still waiting for. Complete disregard for customers and I can't believe a multibillion dollar company gets away with this."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2018-11-17,1,I went here for a latte and asked the staff if they do one with their new Christmas blend. The girl treated me like I was stupid. So I opted for a normal but I must have irritated her as what I got was pure steamed milk. No hint of coffee so I went to Pret. Enjoying a wonderful latte now!

Today around 4 PM I went in for my coffee just like I do EVERYDAY, and ordered a Venti Soy Misto, what i order every single day.. there was no line or people waiting for a drink but for some reason it was taking the baristas (2 females) who were laughing and making jokes long to prepare my coffee, when they finally started i see the girl steaming regular milk i assumed that was for a pickup order because i clearly had ordered my drink with SOY milk. So she hands me my drink and i asked nicely if it had soy milk and very rudely she told me I hadn't ordered it with soy milk yet i was charged for the soy milk. Both girls behind the counter started to laugh in my face which seemed like they were mocking me after telling me i didnt ask for soy when she had clearly repeated the order to me when i paid. Of course they remade my drink but i had never experience such horrible service from any Starbucks location"
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2018-11-02,5,Excellent customer service & experience from the baristas ! Even though the barista got my order wrong the manager on duty made my moment right  & gave me a gift card so that my next drink would be free of charge. I love it there !! All smiles !
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2018-10-29,3,Normal Starbucks quality coffee but way way too loud. Tried to do some work on my laptop and it was painful. Gave it 2 chances and both times the music was turned up to 11. Not a good coffee house experience
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2018-09-06,1,Worst service ever. Two days in a row they absolutely forgot my order. Only after standing around for 15 minutes the first day and 10 minutes the second did they figure it out. There must be another one close by that does it better.
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2018-08-15,1,"This is hands down the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. Even though there were only 2 people in line, they took 10 minutes to take those 2 orders, and got BOTH ORDERS WRONG! When they gave the wrong size drink to the girl behind me, they LOUDLY BLAMED HER for ""not being specific enough."" You would think IT'S THEIR JOB to ask you what size drink you want. EVERY SINGLE MILK CONTAINER WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY. When multiple people came back to the counter to ask for milk, they gave us attitude and keep saying someone will bring it out, even though a long time has passed and no one brought out anything.

The only thing this Starbucks is good for is to use the bathroom if you have diarrhea and are desperate, or if you're homeless and need to hide from the rain."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2018-06-11,5,Excellent morning staff yesterday. Sensitive to customers needs.  Helped me out big time .  Food and beverage were good and location couldn't be better!!
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2018-02-16,5,"I received great service from this Starbucks on multiple occasions. They have ample seating, space and provide good service. On several occasions I have been greeted with friendliness from the baristas and a male barista whose name I don't know (on December 21, 2017 at 7:16 pm). I hope Starbucks recognizes this consumer evaluation and this employees talent and consider the appropriate reward for their employees. I was thankful for their hospitality. It has been the only times we have tipped for coffee without feeling obliged or that they didn't deserve it."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-12-16,1,Unfriendly staff. Slow service. Bathroom is closed. Didn't have hot chocolate or cake pops in the winter. Boo.
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-12-14,2,"This location is quite large with plenty of space to sit down.  However, ordering a drink can be a challenge.  The last two times I was there ordering something it never made it over to the barista and kept me there for 10 minutes waiting.

No sure where the disconnect is but very disappointing."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-11-30,3,"Honestly, this Starbucks is fine. Pretty big staff turnover but that's nothing out of the ordinary and I find the baristas are usually good. I think they could add a second bar area but otherwise no complaints."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-09-15,5,"I really don't understand any of these bad reviews. I love this place! It is very hard to believe how spacious this place is when you see the entrance. This is very spacious and the layout is amazing! I never had any issues with my drinks and the bathrooms are super clean. Yea it gets busy in the mornings, i guess its cuz its cuz these baristas are pretty good. I alway order my drink 10 mins ahead and and its always waiting for me at the pick up!"
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-08-11,3,"It's an Ok Starbucks, they are usually very busy and sometimes that affects your drink order. If you want to get a coffee here and you are in a hurry I would recommend ordering ahead with the app and avoiding the lines. Which by the way they can be very long since a lot of people work around this area. They also have beer on draft if you feel like having one!"
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-08-03,3,"I get the bad reviews I suppose, it can be very crowded with long lines etc. Enter mobile ordering. I walk in and my drink is right there for pick up barely 2 mins later (just regular coffee). What I do like about this one when I stay that is, there is plenty of comfortable seating, no homeless (yet) unlike the one I used to go to who removed a bunch of tables yet allows the same homeless guy to occupy one of them almost every morning, and it's not freezing or a wind tunnel like another new one I used to go to but stopped because I was freezing my ass off. So it works for me. Close to Bryant where I sometimes take it out to in the morn also."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-07-16,1,"Staff is semi-friendly but not properly trained and oblivious to customers requests. Store was in clean condition but one star for the food on display 

Counted 5 nats and moldy food in display, Pointed out moldy food to employee; didn't seem surprised and left food in case.  Probably one the most rancid Starbucks food cases I have ever seen :("
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-07-13,1,"I also have to add...is there a reason why i feel like I'm walking into a club when I go to this starbucks (and a few others in Manhattan)?  I mean if the music is too loud to hear people's orders, lower it.  I assume it's the staff but it's annoying."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-06-29,1,Worst Starbucks ever !!! I just order pike it's almost take 10 min!!!! There is couple guys all of them pointless
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-06-15,1,What is this?? This is not a Java chip frap. The employees here are rude and will not fix your drink if they mess it up.
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-04-14,1,"I mean I guess we can all assume starbucks service in the city is mediocre and subpar. Waited 5 minutes for someone to notice me at the cashier altho the place was empty and the baristas were just roaming about behind the counter blatantly ignoring me which I'm fine with as long as they get my order right. Got a simple grande coffee. Sassy barista then asks me in some horrid fake British accent or something (she must be an ""aspiring actress"") if I want grande. Yes the label your fellow homie passed to you says grande so clearly very obviously grande is the size I asked for. later that evening (and by later I mean two minutes later) I ask for the bathroom code which she incorrectly provides. She then tells everyone on one side that the area is closing in like five minutes while giggling like a mad hyena so we were like um we don't know if she's serious. Lovely staff just absolutely endearing (sarcasm) service is shit."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-02-18,5,"A Bux is a Bux is a Bux, you say? Sometimes a Bux distinguishes itself as superior. Sometimes a Bux welcomes you with open arms, cleanliness, restrooms and decor. This is such a Bux.

Upon entering, I was very duly impressed by the layout and seating. I saw solo and coupled customers working, eating, drankin' and all were basking in the atmosphere. I ordered a cold brew. The lady and the gentleman working at 1pm on Sat 2/18 provided excellent customer service. Thank yous!  

My drank was great. The restrooms were clean. I loved the booth seating. I will surely be back when I'm in the area.

Pro tip: great Bux to work from ""home"" at (or, let's be real ""work""...)  or to have an informal work meeting or team builder."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2017-01-03,1,"Very nice location aesthetically. Too bad they put their weakest staff here. I left wondering if this is really Starbucks because I felt like I just left a McDonald's. You could at least apologize for making errors in orders (better yet, actually attempt to listen when you're taking them in the first place!) Less lip smacking from the entitled, lazy, childish staff, too. I would never hire them- I like people with work ethic who know how to smile and care about hospitality. :) 

I'll be going to the other location around the corner from now on, and you should too if you're reading this."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2016-11-02,1,The restrooms are always closed. Guests sleep at the tables. The manager does not know what he is doing. Weird place.
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2016-11-01,3,"I think it's a new place in the area. Good thing unlike other Starbucks places they have my favorite Blonde Roast and available sitting spaces; plus honey since I don't use sugar and served in separate cup almond milk if you prefer non-dairy milk. Bad thing their music is to loud if you want to do some work or studies, and they have two bathrooms both out of order, the reason I gave three stars."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2016-09-15,1,"WORST. STARBUCKS. EVER. I stop here because it's on my way home, but they are consistently rude, take forever and mess up my order almost every time. It was incorrect again today so I won't be back. There are other Starbucks close to this one...I'd recommend those instead. Don't waste your time/money/patience here."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2016-09-07,3,"I think this is the best Starbucks in Midtown to hang out and do work in, with one caveat...the temperature. It's literally around 60 degrees at all times and I don't actually think any of the staff have control over it. I'll sometimes bring a winter coat and it's not even enough. Not sure what whoever built this place was thinking."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2016-08-26,1,"I asked for a Soy vanilla chai latte and I received a vanilla chai latte with regular milk. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until I was halfway through the drink. I noticed that the drink was different but I didn't think it was because of the milk. I ordered soy milk because I'm lactose intolerant. So now I have to deal with an upset stomach because they got my order wrong. Plus when I confronted the barista, he automatically got an attitude and denied  that I said soy when I'm 1000% sure I asked for soy."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2016-07-24,1,"I ordered at 421pm and didnt get my drink until 445pm- there were 3 extremely unprofessional boys (based off behavior) that were behind the counter and too busy conversating with each other to even take orders or make our drinks- everyone at the bar were flipping out because they were experiencing the same thing! The fake and rude as Sh*t ""barista"" ROB purposely took his time preparing drinks and would laugh to his peer and commented for ALL to hear- that he will go even slower. It doesn't take 30 mins to make a frappuccino or iced coffee- if you don't like your job, get a new one! You had one hispanic slim cashier- I believe by the name EJ or something amongst those lines- that was too busy on his cellphone and talking about his night out while another employee that was a tall dark skin male- who literally stood there- pouring cream to make whipped cream- however why would u need like 10 canisters full- when NO ONE WAS GETTING THEIR DRINKS?!? Its NYC in the middle of a heatwave off 5th avenue- move with a smile on your face and sense of urgency. I have already reported to starbucks and will be disputing charge with my bank. I asked EJ repeatedly for refund and he refused, unbelievable!!! If you are gonna behave so disrespectfully Rob- don't forget you are wearing a name tag genius."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2016-07-21,1,"Literally the worst cafe I've ever been to. Messy, with a huge line, trash sitting on the checkout counter, continual mistakes on drinks before mine, and 3 employees and waited 10 minutes for a iced latte. On top of that, I substituted a type of milk which they were out of, and they only told me after it was made, and didn't offer to refund the difference I paid. Overall a pointless place."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2016-06-30,1,"Rude - waited 5 minutes for one of the THREE employees standing at the register to even look up and acknowledge that I was there, then they couldn't even stop their conversation long enough for me to order. Oh, and I got 3/4 of a drink."
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2016-05-05,1,"Came here to buy a sandwich, wanted to use reward but they charged my card. I went back to get it refunded and pay with the reward. I first asked a guy, he obviously was not willing to help and asked me to stand back in line. So I stand in line, when it's my turn they ask me to step aside because that machine is for customers. Am I not a customer? I stood and waited there for 20 minutes they just pretend to not see me. When I asked them again they pretend to forget my request and replied: how can I help you? Are you a fish with short memory? You've really degraded the reputation of Starbucks, you don't deserve to work there. Find another job suit for you!"
43,starbucks-new-york-474,2016-04-29,1,"Went there for the first time this morning. Cashier that took my order was extremely rude. Okay. Then the lady that made my Green Tea Latte didn't even tell me my drink was ready and she didn't even hand it over to me or push it over!!!
She completely ignored me. I spent almost $4 for a drink that was made poorly and I received terrible Service!!!!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2020-02-14,1,"Hands down the worst baguette I've had my whole time in nyc. 
Do not buy from the grab and go

The bread was stale as hell. Even with a blast in toaster oven it was tough to eat. The filling was paper thin cheese single slice and a single paper thin slice of ham with mustard on top of the cheese. 

Honestly shocked that a bakery think grab and go means u can sell days old bread. Put me off the chain altogether."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2020-01-26,4,"Le Pain has the nicest employees! This location is the largest I believe I've ever been to visit. It's near my doctors office. Plus I love to walk down Park Avenue and stop for a macaroon. 

I'm sure this location suffered with scaffolding being up for years. I was always confused about the entrance locations. I usually grab and go. One day when I needed to use the restroom I was taken to the dine-in area. I was amazed at the size of the space. This location has the biggest outdoor seating area I've ever seen. Since they weren't busy the kind server said I could bring my cookie and coffee back to a table if I wanted. That's exactly what I did. I took advantage of the large open windows enjoying the view. 

There you have it! Yet another of my Le Pain positive experiences. (My photos were taken previously.) I'm not sure what happened to my review and photos of this location. I know I've frequented this location while Yelping!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2020-01-10,5,"So this Le Pain Quotidien is really good, it actually is where my old office used to be in NYC before we moved, and I was lucky enough to stop by before we did.  I wanted something sweet, but not too too sweet for breakfast, and the guy working the cash register was super helpful and steered me in the right direction with the lemon hibiscus croissant.  It was so delicious and didn't even need any butter, and he and I stood there talking a good 10 minutes about different kinds of croissants and coffees.  Next time I'm in the city I'll have to swing by for another croissant, they're worth it."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-11-04,1,"Honestly, I like Le Pain Quotidien and I've visited many different locations. All locations have a good service and food usually comes very fast. This was a  first time when I went with my friend to this location on our lunch break. After waitress took our order (lunch special - soup and avocado toast) we waited our order about 30 min and waitress never came to us to let us know about delay or when we'll get our lunch. And it wasn't busy time - a lot of tables were free. Oh, wait, she came once when I called her and said that it is coming. Never. Even when I decided to leave she didn't apologize or say anything. Very bad customer service. Wouldn't recommend."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-10-09,4,I had some time to kill before I had to be at work today and thought I'd sit down somewhere and have breakfast. This is a really cute little breakfast/brunch place. I got the avocado toast with an egg. It was probably the most perfect avocado toast I've ever had. Super flavorful. I really like crunchy grainy bread and this bread was exactly that. Kind of pricey (for me anyways!) $16 for the avocado toast with egg. But it was a nice environment and great food.
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-09-16,2,Terrible service. Employees don't know how to make anything as good as any other le pain. They made me repeat my order 10 times and still messed it up. Also takes 30 minutes to make something so simple. Would not come here again.
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-07-21,4,"Ate here twice while in NYC. DELICIOUS. nice atmosphere, great food and not overpriced. Bathroom could use some sprucing up, otherwise could eat here every day."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-07-16,5,"Very cute restaurant. I was in the area and came here for lunch. I ordered the grilled chicken and cheese melt. It came with drizzled pesto. I loved it. One of my friends ordered the bakers breakfast I would def get that next time I come. It comes with avocado toast, split pea soup and quinoa over arugula. It looked amazing! Service was good and they have a grab and go bakery area. I got a warmed croissant to go. I must say it had to be the best croissant I've ever had. It was so flaky and baked to perfection!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-05-17,1,"I've always love Le Pain Quotidien, but this location seems to have some sanitation issues. Both times that I have been here, I found hair in my food (circled in red in the photo). Today, I actually found two strands. Last visit, only one and I can assure you...they weren't mine...

Regardless, place is roomy and has a lot of space to sit and do work. Mint lemonade is good and hair-free. 

Please have your staff do something with sanitation. I'm tired of finding surprises from the staff in my food."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-05-14,5,"I work in the building at 3 Park Ave and frequent this location. The food is delish. I like the salads and love the warm grain bowl. I enjoy the chicken soup, it's a staple, and the baguette w the soup is delish. The brownies are my favorite dessert. They have wonderful customer service too, everyone is great but especially Stephani. She's really nice and always goes above and beyond to make sure that you are happy with your order. Stephani makes great suggestions as well. Many times I choose to get lunch from here b/c she's usually there when I go and I know the service will be great. I don't know everyone's name but Roshinie is really nice as well!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-05-03,5,"Had a pick up order through ritual, but was able to quickly pick up my drink without issue and the cold brew was pretty good for a place that doesn't specialize in coffee
Looked like there was ample seating for such a high volume area, and it wasn't excessively noisy or anything that would make me want to not spend time there if I were getting something to eat"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-04-26,5,"Such a gem of a spot in busy, crowded and noisy midtown Manhattan. It's my favorite place to come and grab a coffee and get some work done on my laptop. Great service at the coffee counter :) and great outdoor space too, that is surprisingly never crowded!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-04-22,5,"The crispy quiche was delicious. Plus, this is my favorite LPQ location (3 Park Ave) because of the beautifully elevated terrace with outdoor seating."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-03-05,4,I had breakfast here for the first time and I must say it was so delicious. Everything was so fresh. I'm not a big coffee drinker and luckily I had ordered coffee and they have the most amazing Peruvian dark roast I've ever had. So good that I literally bought a bag for myself. The only issue I had was that my dish came with a boiled egg except they served me a whole egg with shell on it. So I had to crack it myself and it got pretty messy. I think they should fix that and just serve sunny side up with the avocado toast or crack the boiled egg themselves. If it wasn't for that I would have given a 5 star. Servers were super kind and attentive. Definitely coming back.
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-01-30,5,"Just witnessed how customers can be so rude to a restaurant staff. Let us be clear, this Le Pain is my favorite. Staff is amazing, food is great. Sometimes they struggle with service but usually they're understaffed and I can understand cause every single time when I wait more than 10 minutes, they apologize and give me everything that I want. 
I saw a lady literally bullying the server who was super nice and dealing with so many tables. He was running around and trying to get everyone happy, but this girl was sooo rude to him! Even when she replaced her order and got everything, she still wanted to be bi***y about everything! Anyway, I know your staff, I know your managers, please, keep the good work! Don't pay attention to rude customers, that's my advice"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-01-30,1,"I have been a fan and a customer of LPQ since 2010. I work remote and I love that I can work out of there, eat good food, and enjoy good coffee. But this particular location has to be the WORST I have been to.

The servers never seem to know what they are doing. They all seem overwhelmed, most likely due to being understaffed on the floor. 

I am constantly waiting to be seated, given a menu, and I have to literally flag down a server. Because I am sometimes in a time crunch, I have to go up to a server to remind them I am here and have not ordered.

One guy, I am not sure what his name is but the name on my receipt is Nikola, S, is extremely rude. He is detached, and passive-aggressive. He does not make you feel warm or convivial which I know is a pillar of LPQ. 

I used to be a server and know how it feels to be in the weeds but a smile, and being nice and not an asshole about it goes a long way. It sucks because I work in the area and would love to be able to come here on a daily basis. But the management, and the servers so far just suck. 

I am now on minute 26 waiting for my check so I can pay and leave."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-01-24,1,"The employees are dumb - I am sorry to say this, but multiple times they completely forgot my order and let me wait for 30 minutes or more just standing around for my food order. And all 4 times they looked at me with a dumb confused look their face and asked me what I was waiting on... Like HELLO? There were only like 2-3 other people waiting on food. They need to pay attention more and be more alert/aware of their job and surroundings."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-01-12,3,Foods okay but definitely not worth the price. There are a lot of other brunch breakfast places close to this location that have way more selection and better pricing
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-01-09,1,"I wish I could give a negative star.  I went to this restaurant with my dad, other people went in after us and we're eating before we were. There was something floating in my water!  The food was HORRIBLE. I had a egg and salmon skillet, it was dry, the salmon was super salty and the fried egg was greasy and so overcooked that the yolk was powdery.  My dad had a breakfast bowl that had ancient grains, avocado, a fried egg with sweet potato and arugula.  No dressing at all, nothing to bring the dish together and very under seasoned.  I'll never go back."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2019-01-02,5,"OMG!!! My wife and I were visiting friends in New York They picked Le Pain Quotidien , and we are all delighted. The service Chelsea provided was tops, and the food was excellent, We had a warm grain bowl and an egg sandwich and we were delighted by how good the food was 
The best place for good and healthy food
The pastries were amazingly fresh and yummy
The food took a little long to hit out table but the wait was well worth it
We will sure return
T"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-12-30,1,Tomato soup or avocado toast with salmon just gave me food poisoning. Violently ill. Maybe it was the lettuce.
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-12-29,4,"Lovely food, and a pleasant, airy space. But understaffed! The few servers were moving at the speed of light trying to keep up.  I do recommend going, but not when you are in a hurry."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-12-26,4,"This location is very large, which makes it a great option if you're looking for a great grab and go breakfast before a big day in the city. That said, they have plenty of seating for table service for those who want to stay and eat a hot breakfast. Though the customer service left a little to be desired during my visit (no one in line, and no one to ring us up in sight) we were eventually served and those working apologized for the wait. I ordered an iced americano with a croissant and both were pretty good. The croissant was especially decadent and filled me up for a morning full of walking. They also have some nice outdoor seating if you're lucky enough to visit on a nice day."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-12-24,4,"This is such a great location not only to get a coffee or pastry but also to do some work or meet with friends. It has an open concept with both table seating as well as counter service. They also have nice clean bathrooms which is a sign that they take pride in their location. In the summer time, the outdoor patio has chairs and tables where you can sit and look out onto park avenue. 

Another plus is they have a solid wifi connection so I can't see a real negative to this place. The food and drinks are pricey but that is everywhere in nyc. I usually stop in to meet people for work and enjoy a tea/pastry. It is the perfect spot for that so I love this place."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-10-07,1,"Native New Yorker and I decided to have breakfast here today rather then a coffee shop 
A) coffee comes in bowls , no handles.  A bit pretentious but whatever
B) food- water was warm, frittata and pancakes cold.  I don't expect frittata to be made from scratch but take the time to warm it up.   I do expect the mini pancakes to be made from scratch.  They weren't.  And they could not be bothered to warm these up either. 

For tourists and New Yorkers - stick with good coffee shops. 

Also, waiter was in a bad mood but he was the only guy working so I get it"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-10-03,1,Horrible service.  Focused on seating people vs. taking orders.  Not enough staff for the amount of people they have coming in.  And rude servers.
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-08-06,2,Service is very slow. Food quality is OK. Interior is nice but not the best place for a coffee and a croissant when you are in a hurry. Over 15 minutes wait.
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-07-19,4,"I'm an LPQ addict.

I love their avocado toast w/chia seads, kale, lemon, & citrus cumin-yesssss I finally found out what that red powder was. Oddly I thought it was some grounded red pepper but then they told me cumin-I have cumin at home, it doesn't taste like that-citrus cumin. 

The iced coffee is great. The Red jacket fuji apple juice is cold pressed without added water or sugar so all natural. 

The breakfast sandwich- oh my lord, soft fresh brioche with an egg, smoked cheese, and avocado. Mmm mmmm mmmm (u can add applewood smoke bacon as well) 

I have had their nougat too-it's wonderfully soft-perhaps a tad sweet for my liking but still great. 

The belgian soft waffle w/berries and cream-delicious. 
The steel cut oatmeal is delicious as well.

Not gonna lie, I wanna say that the:
-ROASTED TURKEY & AVOCADO
radish, cucumber, arugula and vinaigrette
-GRILLED CHICKEN & SMOKED MOZZARELLA MELT arugula, tomato salsa and basil oil
-watermellon cooler drink
Were all my least favorite. 

Also, LPQ is on the pricey side so not an every day thing. Keep that in mind."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-07-02,1,"Absolutely Awful!!!  Ordered a breakfast sandwich, tasted gross and was cold! The coffee came out 20min after we ordered and was cold, then they brought out another ""pot"" and it tasted like Dirt!  Do Not Go for Breakfast for sure, my stomach hurts and to say disappointed is an understatement!!! I just realized there's a dinner around the corner and i am pissed we didn't see it prior !"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-06-06,1,"As someone who has knowledge & experience in both cooking & restaurant/food service, this is one of the most poorly managed restaurant bakeries I have ever been to. I've not been to any other Le Pain Q locations but this one is terrible. I've been there 3 times. It is a nice airy space with lots of natural light & pleasant decor, it could be a great place to dine, but sadly the food & drink are terribly overpriced for what you get. I've had a better croissant from Dunkin Doughnuts. Today (a Wed.) I stopped for a late breakfast. As has been the case the 2 previous times, the management  is invisible (there are 3 managers, I understand) & the very pleasant wait staff I have experience each time is always overworked (likely underpaid). They do not have enough servers (wait) on the floor & they have no bussers. The servers must take orders, serve, bus & deal with customer bills & payments. I feel so bad for them. Each time the server has done the best they are able while having to juggle so many duties & so many tables. I actually scolded the manager the second time I was there. I guess it did no good because they are still doing the same crap of not having enough servers on the floor. It's pathetic. The food is another story, a rip-off. I ordered the Skillet Eggs w/ Dill & Smoked Salmon, a pot of coffee & then also asked to add a croissant. I can't blame the waiter for the hard yolks & tough eggs or having to walk to the server bar to get jam for my croissant. He just had too much on his hands. I asked him & another waiter about why they don't have more staff on the floor. They told me it was like that most of the time. That is also when I learned about no bussers to clear tables. I would fire all three managers. This place is so poorly manged. I felt bad for the waiters, so I did not complain about the hard yolks & tough eggs. I did express my empathy & sympathy for how hard they had to work. It irritates me to see employees over-taxed like at this place. I wish they offered option of cups for coffee. The coffee in the pot also gets cold quickly. Now I know why it has been such a long time since I've gone to this place. Big lousy chain restaurant poorly managed from top to bottom. They get a big red ""F"" from me for service & food & prices!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-06-05,4,"Great place for a leisurely brunch. The breakfast sandwich was great, as was the coffee. Interesting that coffee is served in bowls with no handles.

I had a delicious breakfast sandwich with organic egg, avocado, cheddar cheese with chipotle aïoli and croissant. The warm Belgian waffle was superb in topped with fresh fruits. Jeff our server was great. The ambience was clean."

44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-05-17,1,"This location always seems to overwhelmed and lacks service, both times I've been here - once on a Sunday when it was almost empty and now when it's full and lots of wait staff running around but still no one to even bring a menu."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-05-06,2,The place is nice but the service is really bad. The servers don't wanna work. It used to be much better...
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-04-30,3,"Number of Visits: 10+

I am in love with the staff here, but not the kitchen. Depending on what time you are going during the lunch hours, the kitchen is so backed up that the to go orders take a while to process as well. 

Tip: Order on the app for pick up so that you can be on your way quickly. Their breads are amazing and it really makes the meal so it is not an item to miss out on. Pair a $17 chicken salad with some complimentary bread and you are looking at a filling meal. Another favorite is the fig and prosciutto flat bread which is very light.

We also have had some problems with the items that came out from the kitchen which is very unfortunate when you're paying such a high premium for quality food."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-04-27,3,"Here's my issue with the place, and not just this location, but all of them: who and what are you, Le Pain - are you a restaurant? Are you a coffee shop? Are you like Panera Bread? Why is a cold open-faced sandwich so expensive? Why is there always a sloppiness to the service? Why do I never see bussers helping servers who look stressed and frantic, which makes me feel awkward and unable to enjoy my meal? Why are there no handles on the coffee cups? Why is everything in a bowl!? What's up with the farm equipment all over the walls? Just why? Its not that I dislike it, I love the fresh bread and the organic coffee, I just really can't, for the life of me, figure this place out."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-04-14,3,I come here all the time because it is just in front of my gym. Great coffee and bakery but the service for brunch has really gone down
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-04-02,5,"The organic coffee is mediocre at best; proceed cautiously when reading the ""organic"" label. The shock-effect of organic coffee does not adequately match the anticipated taste. Overall, I would not buy the organic coffee again... unless under dire circumstances, even that is far-reached."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-02-11,3,"I read the reviews but still decided to try the avocado toast.. 
It was okay, I did like the taste that the cumin salt, chia seeds and lemon gave, but the toast was really hard - like it had been left out a while after toasting

I felt it was overpriced at $11.95

The baked goods looked so good though, I really want to try the cinnamon croissant roll. And the chocolate cookies are huge!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-02-09,3,"This location has much more potential than three stars but that's all it is. If you look at the floors they are filthy. For some reason, there are no napkins available for people who don't eat in the restaurant area. Like they give you your coffee and pastry items but never any napkins. So cheap."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-02-01,3,"FOOD: I ordered avocado toast with salmon and a latte. The latte is served in a bowl(???) without a handle so you literally drink it like a soup. The avocado toast is very hard and it tasted a little sour. The presentation is okay, but the food was served very slowly. I waited for 10 minutes to take my order and another 15 minutes to get my food. I don't recommend coming here if you are under time pressure / constraint. 

ENVIRONMENT: the inside is kind of crowded. Tables are very close together so I can clearly hear the conversation from the table next to me. Honestly I was a little disturbed by both how loud they are and how little privacy I have. But if you want a casual setting in which you can freely converse and not being hurried, here it is. The service is okay but again slow."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-01-26,5,"I Love the French country feel that they have created . The breads , coffee and pastries are second to none.
If you are looking for a pleasant ear in breakfast experience , I highly recommend this great retreat on park ave & 34 st.
Pancakes,Belgium Waffles,Avocado Toast , Omelettes all phenomenal.
Fantastic eatery in the heart of the city.
Open Sat & Sun ... lobby of 3 park or promenade entrances. BON JOUR !"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2018-01-19,2,"Let me start off with something positive: the food is tasty. 
I always get the avocado toast, and I've tried a few of their pastries, and everything always tastes delicious. However, the quality of the food here is the most inconsistent I've ever experienced at a restaurant. Sometimes they're generous and give a big slice of bread with plenty of salad, and everything is seasoned magnificently. Other times the slice of bread will be tiny with a few small pieces of kale on the side. Sometimes its under-seasoned, and sometimes you can't taste the seasoning at all. I feel like it's always a guessing game when I come here, and I've started to come less and less because I should be receiving the same great quality every time, and I just don't get that. For the $13 price tag on their avocado toast, it should be phenomenal every single time. The only thing that keeps me coming back is that it's a quick place to grab breakfast before work, and the staff is always very friendly and kind."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-12-21,4,"We ate here twice for breakfast and once for lunch. Breakfast was excellent! I had the mini Dutch pancakes. Others had the avocado toast, Belgium waffle, and chicken tartine. Service was very good. Our suggestion would be instead of individual coffee pots, use a thermal pot for the table. The coffee gets cold too fast by the time you pour your second cup. On Our 2nd day for breakfast, the person in charge was on her cell phone texting constantly. I don't know if it was personal but it was distracting. - For lunch we had the Bakers lunch. Excellent tomato soup, avocado toast, and quinoa taboule. We shared a rich and delicious French donut. Service was slow but we weren't in a rush. - overall, the food is tasty and we'll be back."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-12-17,5,"Do not skip this restaurant ...friendly...relaxing and food is awesome.  The atmosphere is, friendly and great for a larger group..."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-12-10,5,Brittany was a very friendly and attentive server! She was there to answer all of my questions and frequently checked in on my table. Recommended this location to all of my friends and told them to ask for Brit! 10/10
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-12-01,2,"The location is lovely, bright and open, and for many I'm sure this is a good PQ, at Park Ave and 33rd. But if you are gluten sensitive, beware. In my experience the staff at this location seem less careful than at other PQ's I've tried. Today was the worst- I ordered a tartine and asked for the gf cracker since I was concerned the gf bread might be more likely to have traces of gluten (from cross contamination during the prep of the tartine). I was told indeed the gf bread goes through the same toaster as the regular bread (so no good for me). After this conversation with the waiter and choosing the gf cracker, I was surprised to see what looked (and tasted, to my friend) like large crumbs of bread crust sprinkled on top of my otherwise gf tartine. Several such large crust like crumbs were visible. How did these get there? Were these crumbs from their gf bread? Didn't look like it. They looked like French bread crust flakes and were actually quite large. I've had consistently good experiences at the Flatiron PQ on Broadway and many others. The waiters at these other places seem concerned about sensitivities more than at this PQ. Of course none of these locations are gluten free facilities. I know there can be no guarantees. But it's nice to go somewhere where the staff appear to try- and I've never seen anything quite like what I saw on my tartine today - such big crumbs of ???"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-11-23,2,Why would you call Belgian Hot Chocolate to whatever chocolate syrup and milk mix I just got?! It's not only insulting for Belgium but for hot chocolate.
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-11-13,2,"I don't know why I continue to come to LPQ considering I consistently have a bad experience. Maybe it's because they're all over the place and I can always find a good place to sit. Anyway, I walked in and the workers just stared at me? Most other LPQs at least have a sign indicating whether it's self-seating or if a host will seat you. I sat myself and someone brought me a menu with barely a simple hello. 

Anyway, I ordered an avocado toast with smoked salmon. Simple af and keeps me full so can't really complain about how basic it is. It got to me really fast, which was good. But my goodness this was probably the worst avocado toast I've ever had, and I didn't even know it was possible to mess this up. The bread was stale and hard to chew. There was too much pepper (way too much. It's tragic). There was a salad thing on top¿? Just didn't mix right. 

Also ordered a matcha latte which tasted like milk and sugar but at this point I already had low expectations. Anyway will not be coming back to LPQ anytime in the near future since it's consistently subpar."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-10-28,1,"I used to love LPQ, but this morning's experience has changed my mind. I walked into the store at Park and 33rd and there was no greeter and no sign saying seat yourself or wait, or explaining that some of the many tables are for waiter service and some are for ordering at the counter. I went to the counter and asked, ""is this where I order food?"" and the person just said, ""If you want to sit there, you can order from me."" So I sat at a table and waited, and ended up paying $15 for a latte in a to go cup and a cold ham and cheese croissant in a box. It was barely a step up from McDonalds. The feeling that I've been jerked around and conned out of 15 bucks has ruined my whole day."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-10-16,1,"We used to love  Pain Quotidien. Looking forward to a reliable breakfast of soft boiled eggs and great toast, we left this meal amazed that this location remains in business given what they served up. The place was dirty, our server had on a dirty t-shirt, and the soft-egg ""machine"" in the kitchen was  supposedly not working yet the waiter didn't mention this until he served us the eggs hard boiled and cool to the touch (likely directly from the fridge).  Only then were we told they couldn't make soft-boiled eggs that day!  The kitchen offered up fried eggs as an alternative which we heartily agreed to. They arrived overcooked. Unable to deliver sunnyside up eggs? Seems so basic. Additionally the coffee wasn't hot. This location should be avoided."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-10-08,1,I tried this location for the first time last year and had a horrible experience with customer service. Decided to give it another shot today when I was craving a nice buttery and fresh croissant. Left disappointed once again with an old croissant that didn't even flake. Pretty much trashed my breakfast and went elsewhere. Will not be giving this place another shot. They really need to get their food and costumer service together.
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-10-03,1,"I had high hopes for this place but the service was sooooo slow and none of the employees look like they even want to be here. My hot chocolate tasted like dirty water and when I brought it back for them to remake he offered to squirt more chocolate syrup. I'm sorry....more? I paid $4.50 for a Belgium Hot Chocolate for them to just mix water and chocolate syrup together? It still tasted gross after that and the only reason I stayed and didn't ask for a refund was because I had 3 min left until my live online class was about to begin (because I waited to order for like 15 min).
They also never even apologized for the wait. Everything customer service wise was just wrong."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-09-15,3,"This is a perfectly good La Pain. The service is good, the coffee is fresh and the food is tasty. 

We had:

- Soft Boiled Egg with Salmon 

- Soft Boiled Egg with Bread

- Pancakes

- Hard Boiled Egg

I would definitely come back!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-08-31,1,"I spilled a chia pudding by accident and it got all over my shoes. Of course I was already buying my breakfast which equates to about $25 with the price scale the restaurant has. The guy behind the counter felt awful and even offered me a drink for the hassle, however the manager glared at me and casually told me I still had to pay for the chia pudding then walked off without letting me get a word in about the situation, even though it was all over my shoe and I was purchasing a few items already. Horrible management. I hope she doesn't treat her employees this rudely. The guy behind the counter was a sweetheart though!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-07-19,3,"i love the location and the food is awesome although i think its a little pricey. However, the service is just horrible. They are just so slow and disorganized. Ordered a soup and a sandwich to go and it took them 20 mins to get it for me. This is so frustrating."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-07-09,1,Took 35 minutes to get drinks and a cold food.  Someone from the inside brought the food outside but then it sat for 5+ minutes as she took silverware and drinks out to other tables.  Good food but we had an overwhelmed waitress that was unable to serve her tables.  A new party sat down at dirty table next to us and when she finally came over after 10 minutes she asked them if they wanted anything else (?).  Maybe she was just having a bad day.  The outside seating and food were good so I would be willing to try this place again
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-06-24,5,"Best place for Avocado toast. You would become so addicted, that you will never get tired of the same thing over and over. They can also customized it to your liking, so you have the ability to add eggs or salmon etc. Try it!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-05-29,1,"What a disappointment. We often go to Le Pain Quotidien, but this location is far below standard. The restaurant is run down and dirty. The server had an unbelievable rude attitude."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-05-10,5,"My coworkers will tell you I rave about this location, since it's been my main Le Pain Quotidien for the past several years. The bread is fresh and the employees working at the cashiers have been as polite as can be. Sure, the prices are on the higher end for avocado toast and salads. I usually leave feeling satisfied with the quality of my meal because I realize I'm paying for the convenience of having organic food in my office building and during the warmer months, some sunshine. More than anything, the employees make the experience.

Today was a great example of why I will be back time and time again. I ordered their Special of the Day (a Zucchini Pad Thai Salad) and it just didn't hit the right notes for me. Almost an hour later and the salad was still sitting here because I paid $14 for a handful of arugula, slivers of underripe mango, and wet cashews. The dressing was a watery mess of lime juice with a cream base. I called them asking if there was anything they would be able to do for me. The manager sprang into action and made sure I received a different salad to my liking in less than two minutes. I don't know many places that would necessarily put that much care into making sure their customers enjoy what they ordered, but I'm very glad to have Le Pain Quotidien here."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-04-11,5,Love the cucumber mint limede and roasted turkey with avocado... Delicious. Calm atmosphere. Truly enjoyed walking in. Will come again.
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-03-21,2,"The location is great. Unfortunately the food and service is poor.

Food is overpriced and mediocre. I've been looking for good bread, but every time I come here (even 8am) they only have 2-3 kinds of loaves and the bread is cold and hard. Same with the bakery items, I'd rather not spend $4.50 on an average croissant. I wouldn't mind buying their expensive bread if it were actually soft and fresh.

Service is usually nice, although rushed for being overstaffed. I bought a coffee and sat down at a table to work. Then the server says the area is for meals and kicks me out. This really irritated me because there's no sign indicating that, and I'm already a paying customer. Apparently it was my fault for ordering my $4.50 coffee from the counter instead of the server. Not coming back here."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-02-21,5,"I just love this location. It has a great outdoor are, nice to get some sun when it's warm outside.

The rustic French decoration give this place a homey feel that Starbucks really lacks.

FOOD
- Gluten free bread: it is one of the best I have tied. I love you can buy half loaf to take home(~$9)
- Avocado Toast: again, the secret is in the bread :) and the chia seeds
- Smoked Salmon Breakfast: really good and filling, comes with a hard boiled egg and plenty of bread (you can ask what bread you like)
- Chicken Curry Salad: very yummy also, not spicy at all, comes on a toast with a bit of salad
- Avocado Mash: really good also. If you got toasts, you can do your own avo toast!
- Green tea: love you can get a tea pot!
- Basket of bread and preserves: love to get this to share with friends. I could eat that Nutella with anything if calories were an ""alternative fact""!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2017-02-20,5,"Coming up out of the 6 train at 33rd Street and Park Avenue, I took a glance around at the businesses to see where I could get a cup of coffee and wait for my husband.

I spotted the words Pain Quotidien. Pain meaning bread, I figured that would be a good spot. I didn't know at the time that this is a chain store here, and going inside, you'd never know it was part of a chain.

The staff is cordial and professional. I asked for a cup of coffee and had a little pot of coffee with a handle-less cup within minutes. Prepared and taking my first sip, I was struck by a flavor not common. I knew at once it was a South American. Soon as I could get my waiter's attention without taking him away from other customers, I asked what coffee was it. At first he said Organic. I meant what country. Guatamalan, Peruvian, Costa Rican. He didn't know exactly, but within a couple minutes he brought to me a pamphlet that explained they have mid-to-high mountain Peruvian. It has a wonderful floral/fruitiness to it that was a delightful change from the generic coffees served so many other places.

The cup having no handle warmed my hands nicely on the cold, blustery day.

Looking over the menu, I decided on the Petit Déjeuner, a bread basket brunch. The coffee I'd already ordered was included, as was a big glass of juice. Asked if I wanted the regular croissant or the chocolate, I asked my waiter (tall black guy whose name I neglected to get) which he prefers, and went with that. I'm glad I did. The croissant that arrived with my bread basket was fresh and warm. The outside was deliciously flaky and crispy. Next time I'm ordering an extra.

The view out over Park Avenue held my attention quite a bit. I enjoyed the quiet classical music playing overhead. That was also a nice change from the too loud ""buy this music!"" played elsewhere. 

I asked for a refill on my coffee and was happy to find on the bill that the refill was free. 

My husband was late arriving, but no one rushed me in the slightest. I ended up leaving almost $5 as a tip on a $16 bill, I was so pleased with the experience.

I very much look forward to going back. I can only hope other locations are as pleasant and the staff so cordial and professional."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-12-28,1,"All i can say is that their management is awful, rude and unprofessional. The waiter has a bad attitude towards the customers. They forgot our order and also messed up with the wrong order. No glasses for water and you have to ask 3-4 times for a coffee refill. I strongly recommend not to frequent this restaurant because this is my second bad experience in here."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-12-19,5,"This is by far the best breakfast/brunch place in New York. Food was great, Service was average, and their OJ is amazing.  I definitely recommend going here for breakfast or brunch."

The food is great, I always order chicken soup, a side of salmon and a side of avocado smash!! When the weather is nice, I recommend sitting outside in the quiet outside space!"

44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-09-29,4,"The food is great but it's a bit overpriced and the servings can be small depending on what you order. I had a wonderful summer grain bowl that was filling but other options like their tartines are more of a snack. The gluten free bread is delicious, I recommend pairing it with some of their sides.

The staff is so friendly at this location and the ambience always relaxing and a great place to get work done."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-09-06,4,"Update, on the catering service: We took a chance and ordered lunchboxes for a meeting in the office and they were fresh and well prepared and the group very much enjoyed them. I took off one star b/c of the bizarre form one has to fill out and scan back a signature for the credit card--that was a first, I don't recall any office caterer ever doing this. Can't they just confirm at pickup?"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-08-27,2,"Love this chain, food is great. This location service wise is abysmal. 
There is no hostess stand.  I noticed other people confused by what was going on too. I wanted to eat outside but knew I would be completely ignored if I did. You have to find a waiter off hand to get seating.  Once you do they tell you they will be with you in a minute, never bring menus. Had to grab some myself. There were at least two managers walking around also being immensely unhelpful to guests. Food took long, they forgot my order. Then no one checked on me when I had it. Asked a manager for the check because I couldn't find my server. Manager said she'd get it but proceeded to just stand around with another employee taking for about 10 minutes five feet away from me till I had to flag down another manager who seemed put off that I had asked her for the check. 
All around unorganized.
My toubbuleh salad was good though."

The reason why it was such a stellar 5-star experience was our server Matilda She was just lovely, came over to greet me and made me feel welcome. After sorting out what I was having - Belgian Waffles! - she brought over a huge bowl of water in a plastic bowl for my dog Asta. WITHOUT MY ASKING. Now that is attention to detail!

What a disappointment, we got seated outside, and while someone (the help) rapidly gave us a table and the menus, the waiter ignored us for 15 minutes. When I friendly waved and asked if we could order, he loudly scolded me that he was very busy, had 3 more tables before us to take up the order and that the only thing I could get for now was tap water if I asked for it. He then turned around and went inside again. I couldn't believe it at first.... We continued to wait patiently. He came back out to the table in front of us with 6 people who also became increasingly disgruntled and who in the midst of being taking the order stood up and left. We left too... This was not going to work. A pity."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-07-04,4,Went here for a quick snack & espresso. The young woman with the red shoulder length hair was very helpful. I usually have a hard time deciding on food and she was very patient with me. Will stop here again when I'm in the area!
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-06-15,2,"As always I really liked the food. White beans soup was amazing. sandwich ingredients were really fresh.

Service is on the other hand went from bad to non-existent during my last 2 visits.
Almost impossible to get attention from the waiter. Prepare to be ignored if you decide to visit this location, especially if you are sitting outside.

Waiting time is another issue at this location. Took 45 minutes for 2 sandwiches to arrive."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-05-25,1,"I have been coming to this Le Pain Quotidien for over four years.

I actually distinctly remember the day when they increased their prices and the cold brew price increased significantly. At that moment I started getting iced Americanos instead which always came to an even $3 (as they should - it's just espresso and water).

But two weeks ago, I went to LPQ with $3 in hand and ordered my iced Americano and the girl behind the counter said ""that will be $4.34."" I paused and said ""Are you sure? I just bought this last week and it was $3.00 even - in fact, it is always $3.00 even"". 

She said ""Yeah... sorry, we raised our prices a little bit."" Not wanting to cause a scene, I took out a few crinkled dollar bills from my wallet and paid for the order. I have not given LPQ any business since then, nor will I give them any future business.

It is absolutely ridiculous for this café to raise their prices over 40% on something that is made primarily of water and has no lengthy brewing process. I've taken my business elsewhere where I can get a great cup of iced coffee for less money than an iced Americano from Le Pain Quotidien."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-05-18,3,"Located on Park Ave, between 33 and 34th st, this branch takes place right next to Starbucks so we can say that they are competitors. To me, Starbucks is ahead, at least for now. The very first reason I say so is that you can not figure out where or to whom to order for 3-4 minutes if no one else is ordering. People await their order to the right of entrance and it seems like they are on line but actually where they take order is right ahead when you enter, which actually makes sense, but no one stays still there. Anyways.

I wanted to get a cookie to go, they have a really really chocolate one which I didn't know the name but I called it the chocolate cookie :)))) The girl didn't get it till I repeat 3 times. It was like $2.75. No way to eat it at once. So rich in flavor. I liked it. They have other pastry choices and they all look tasty and fresh.

It is good to have an alternate place around so i'll keep visiting."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-05-14,1,"Food is ok like all of the locations but the service is terrible. Stay away if you only have an hour to eat lunch, it will probably take more then that"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-04-22,2,"For the price I paid for a smoothie and a croissant, I would have at least expected a ""thank you"" from the woman behind the counter, but she barely glanced in my direction when she slid it across the counter, and she was kinda snappy when she took my order. When I can get better service (and a cheaper drink) at Starbucks, that's saying something."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-04-19,2,"So to be fair we randomly stumbled upon this spot, and we were all hungry, so maybe we shouldn't have stopped into this place for a quick bite. We were greeted and seated within minutes, so A+ for that. Then we ordered coffees for the table, the mugs were really bowls, and the waiter never had all his supplies ready. No joke he had to go back for cream, then he had to go back for silverware and never came back. We literally got up and helped ourselves to silverware from a tray. We all placed our orders and then the waiting continued. The portions were ok, except that by the time we got them it was now over an hour wait so we were hangry. This place was a joke and I can't believe it's still open in NY."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-03-14,2,"This location needs to be a bit more keen to the needs of their customers, the staff is not very friendly at the register in the am and my order was incorrect 2x. 

I love the food but the service is not up to par."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-03-13,1,"Please hire a qualified manager and some experienced staff.  Every time I come in the service is terrible, enough to ruin a dining experience and leave frustrated.  How hard is it to get attentive severs that can take an order and bring it to customers correctly?  Seriously, I don't think I'll be back.  I'm done."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-03-13,1,"Note: I promise you this my final update on this particular location of LPQ, because after yesterday, we won't be returning.

My husband, daughter and I headed to LPQ yesterday for lunch, after receiving a gift card to be used for a future visit (see update #3). From beginning to end this was a terrible idea.

1. We arrived before 2 other tables but our waiter was, as usual, nowhere to be found.
2. When our food finally came - quinoa taboule (me), chicken tartine (husband), bowl of soup (daughter) - it came in pieces. The soup first. 5 minute wait. My quinoa taboule. 10 minute wait. Tartine.
3. The quinoa taboule, which I order on a weekly basis, didn't have the basil dressing, but rather something creamy looking, which I later found out was some type of lemon dressing. I requested it to be fixed.
4. 10 minutes later I flagged down the waiter to ask where my replacement salad was. He said he'd check on it.
5. Another 10 minutes and still no salad. I flagged him down again (not sure why he didn't care to follow up) to find out the status. I saw him speaking with the cooks who were gesturing confusedly. Apparently they'd forgotten to remake the salad.
6. Salad finally comes out (I lost track of time by this point). THEY GAVE ME THE SAME SALAD I SENT BACK 20+ EARLIER WITH THE LEMON DRESSING ON IT.
6. Flag down a different waiter who takes the salad back to the kitchen. Our waiter comes by to apologize and offer me a brownie. I decline and ask for the manager.
7. Manager comes by and says our meal is on the house and assures me the salad will be made correctly and quickly.
8. 10 minutes later I finally get a wilted salad that's half the size it usually is. 
9. 1 minute later my husband points out there is a hair on my avocado.
10. We decide to cut our losses and leave and the waiter says he'll get us the bill. We tell him the manager said the meal is on the house. He checks with her and she says no, just the salad is on the house. 

I give up 3 Park Ave Le Pain Quotidien. You win."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-03-06,5,"This wasn't my first time at a Le Pain, but my first time at this location. This one is very clean, spacious, and welcoming. It's especially nice on a sunny day. The service was quick and the girl behind the counter, whose name was Angelica, was very friendly and made sure everything was just how I liked it. Everyone else seemed just as hard working and efficient. Though the food is not much different from other stores, the experience of this particular location made it so much better! I'll be back soon."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-02-15,1,"It seems that everytime I try to give business to this place, they actively try to dissuade me from ever again trying. 
Either it's the online order that they don't see for 30 min, or it's the order that they get all wrong, or it's putting me on hold for 15 min when trying to get an answer about previously mentioned order... and then not having any adequate response. 
To be honest it's surprising they still get business considering the incompetence the staff has displayed time and time again over the course of the past 6 months. 
Whenever enough time has gone by and I manage to forget the pain of my previous experience there, I think to myself that I'll give this place another try (as some of their food is relatively appealing). However, I soon regret my decision to ever consider spending money here as all the signals i get from this place is that they simply don't care about their customers. 

Save your money, go spend it elsewhere. The staff here are practically telling customers that themselves."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2016-02-14,1,"Service was AWFUL!! Our waiter Hector probably didn't want to work today.  I ordered a latte and he didn't even give me a spoon for my drink. I waited at least 10 minutes to get his attention so that I could have a spoon for my latte that was starting to get cold. He completely ignored us after we placed our order and I had to have one of the young women get my oatmeal that had been sitting waiting to be picked up for at least 10 minutes.   I had to ask the same young lady for water.  She was awesome! Hector continued to ignore us and then finally came over and asked us if we needed anything after he saw that we had our food. Tip = $0 which is commensurate with service!! BTW, I always tip 20 - 30%!!!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2015-11-27,2,I love LPQ but this location is awful.  The room is very pretty but our food was terrible.  First 3 of 4 of our soft boiled eggs (both part of meals - salmon ricotta dish and soft boiled egg dish) arrived hard boiled.  We sent 3 eggs back and we received 3 new eggs which were so undercooked the whites were not even white.  We sent the 3 eggs back and the manager took $6 off the bill which was ridiculous.  She should have taken the two meals off the bill since we ordered them because of the eggs.  We also received the wrong bread order and the service could not have been slower.  The staff was very nice - just the food was subpar.  I am not so excited about going back - I fear this chain has gone downhill. Normally when I am in NY I go every day.   Sad.  Very sad...
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2015-10-20,2,"We tried another location and it was awesome.  This one was a major disaster.  We came here on a Sunday around 2 pm to have lunch.  The place looked a bit empty and not very friendly or happening.  We sat down and the waiter came right away to take our drink order and brought our beverages pretty quickly. After that, it all went downhill.  We ordered two soups, a salad, and two heated sandwiches.  It took FOREVER to get our food.  Then, it finally arrived.  Everyone got their food (including dead-looking lettuce in the salad but the croutons with warm goat cheese looked great!) and then they dropped my cheese and ham sandwich right on the floor.  BAMM, there goes my lunch.  They did not pick it up for a while so we were directing people away from it as we were afraid that someone would step on it and then slip.

The waiter did not come back so we waited.  After a very long wait, I got up and went to the kitchen to make sure that they were making another sandwich for me.
We also needed some butter and more napkins so I just went to get them myself as all the waiters and waitresses had disappeared.
My food finally appeared and made it to the table minus the pickle.  It just fell off the plate on the way to the table and no one went to pick it up.  So people could have slipped.

I had to get up and go to the hostess station to ask someone to pick up my earlier sandwich still on the floor.  They did not clean the floor so all the butter and cheese made a very slippery surface.

The sandwich was nice, very, very, very little cheese and the ham was not good at all but the bread was nice.

We ended up buying some bread and asked them to cut the gigantic loaf in half.  Oh my gosh, that took ages.  They took the loaf in the back and we could see two people struggling to cut it in half.  Then they reappeared with the bread.  We had to audacity to ask for the baguette to be cut in half since it was long.  Well, that took another 15 minutes.  At this time, we were just laughing.

I would say, go for the breads, desserts, and croissants.  The service is beyond terrible though."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2015-09-25,1,"Most indifferent service I've had in a long while - over 5 min to get menus, then about as long to get the order taken. Asked for the check when we got our food and then had to wait a long time to get that, and then get it picked up. One big table but not especially busy otherwise. 

Food was ok, but coffee was just lukewarm. Overall very overpriced for the food and experience."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2015-09-11,5,"First time at Le Pain Quotidien.  Didn't realize there were some branches in Los Angeles on the West Coast where I'm from but decided to give it a try for breakfast/brunch.

Had the waffle with berries, the chia seed pudding and the special: Shrimp on avocado toast.  All three were very good.  Waffle had embedded pieces of sugar in it so when you ate it, it had surprising pops of sweetness.  The Chia seed pudding was kind of like tapioca pudding but less fatty because its chia?  And the Shrimp on avocado toast was yummy with a corn salsa on top of the avocado with the added protein of shrimp.

Atmosphere was nice, mostly business people on this Friday around 11 AM.  Place was well staffed for all the guests who were there, place was clean and there was plenty of seating.  My service was fine and friendly, managers were attentive and checked in on me and my gf a couple times.  

Overall, a good first experience at LPQ.  Maybe I'll try the one on the West Coast now."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2015-08-01,1,"I've been to a lot of places in NYC and this was the first where the bathroom was too dirty to even use.  There was no running water in the bathroom, so I wonder how the employees are washing their hands.  The service was slow, the tables were dirty, and the checks hadn't been cleared from the earlier customers.  Perhaps the manager was on vacation this morning!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2015-07-27,1,"I've been to maybe 12 different Le Pain's in different cities - this place consistently has the slowest service ever, which is so annoying"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2015-07-21,5,"We had a wonderful after wedding brunch for our guests at this location. Faith the manager was so sweet and helped coordinate a part of the restaurant so that our guests could sit together. Josip was our waiter and he was fantastic and friendly. Food is always consistent and delicious. Our out of town guests were really impressed. The bread baskets with all the spreads is not to be missed. The spreads are so good you can eat them with a spoon! I appreciate the service and how flexible everyone was- especially since our guests didn't all show up on time (morning after a wedding....). Thanks again to Josip and Faith for making the end of our special weekend amazing. If you are looking for a spot that is open and can accommodate a large group, this is it!"
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2015-06-04,4,"Well, I was in town for an early morning meeting and had a delicious breakfast here.  The gazpacho was outstanding along with the smoke salmon breakfast plate.  Coffee was served in a pot with a bowl instead of a cup - ie a little too cute for me.  This location is just off the subway line making it super convenient for meeting someone.  Would definitely dine here again."
44,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-139,2015-05-20,5,Josip Majer is great we had good service very happy good food and happy we where 8 people got service very fast..
45,starbucks-new-york-536,2020-01-26,5,"I'm a fan of Starbucks coffee and love that there are many locations throughout Manhattan. All the locations have different layouts and some are very work friendly. I like to bring my work with me so means just relax and do my work   This particular location is not a great one to get your work done. It's smaller then most Starbucks. 

Great service and coffee.

45,starbucks-new-york-536,2019-10-25,4,"It's hard to differentiate one Starbucks from the next, but having thoughtful employees is one way to do so. I stopped in 5 minutes before closing for a black coffee and the staff gave me a cup on the house. Knowing they were going to toss it in 300 seconds anyway, it was a small gesture that went a long way to make the store stand out. 

Thanks, ""Park Ave between 31st and 32nd, kinda hidden in the building"" Starbucks!"
45,starbucks-new-york-536,2019-09-19,1,"This Starbucks is possibly the worst I have ever been to. The employees are rude and clearly hate their jobs. I ordered ahead, and as I stood there waiting, watched the lady make every drink for the people who ordered in store after I arrived. They failed to make the breakfast order and gave me a drink 2/3 full. When I kindly asked her to fill it since I ordered a venti, she proceeded to fill with cold milk. It's convenient, but terrible in every way possible. If I liked Dunkin' Donuts, I'd take my business across the street."
45,starbucks-new-york-536,2019-08-25,1,Bad service happened to me twice with the same staff(Eric). He ignored on line order even you told him and almost 30 mins waiting for a coffee. Unprofessional service with this guy and his coworker onSunday. Bad attitude by try to make wrong order to me twice and poor taste. I am regular customer order more 5-6 times a week. Disappointed!!!!
45,starbucks-new-york-536,2019-07-13,1,"Frankly I'm not here to complain about the drinks itself. Rather than their employee. He was busy on his phone uninterested. Straight up attitude!' Turn me
Off so
Much I ended up going to dunkin instead! I
Asked for suggestions, unbothered. I asked what's the tye dye drink
And he simply said ""it's a Bunch of powder"" with rolling his eyes and staring at his phone. I swear if I didn't have manners to just walk away I would have slapped that phone off his freaking hand! Never coming to this location !!'"
45,starbucks-new-york-536,2019-06-25,5,I whipped out of a third world country to America & my first stop was this Starbucks. The drink did my taste buds wonders. They never hesitate on maximum flavor. I'd like to thank the positive staff in this Starbucks for making my  stay a tad bit more magical. Fellas this ones the one!
45,starbucks-new-york-536,2019-04-22,4,"As with most Manhattan locations being frequented at 9:12am on a weekday: order ahead. It's the only sane way to coffee before work. 

I order ahead 90% of the time and I can't remember more than once or twice when my gallon of iced coffee wasn't ready for me when I got there. Conclusion: the order ahead folks are on their game.

The other 10% of the time I'm not rushing so I wait in line. There's usually a notable wait, but it's evident that all baristas and other Starbuckey folks are doing their best. 

The main inconsistency? The temperature inside. Sometimes it's temperate, maybe even cold. Sometimes it's boiling hot for no reason. 

Nobody ever seems to say anything about it either way, so it's a moot point; but when there's a Starbucks every 77 feet...I guess the little things stick out."
45,starbucks-new-york-536,2018-11-24,5,I like how this Starbucks has seating in the cut at the back of the store hidden from view. The view from the bar stools is nice as one can observe the hustle and bustle of Park avenue. Another great thing about the location is really great customer service. Shout out to the barista for giving me extra caramel in my drink.
45,starbucks-new-york-536,2018-04-16,4,"Number of visits - 10+ 

Absolutely love love love the staff here. They're super friendly, full of energy and really get your morning going. Sometimes lines can be super long, but they really do try to rush things out the door for you. Team is amazing and really knows how you like your drinks. Always addressing you by your name when you're in and out the door, even if they're not serving you. Love love love! Really wish I could've given them a five star rating! 

One downfall is that they run out of ingredients pretty often. Found myself swapping my drinks because there's a shortage of almond milk which sucks since I can only have that and not the other milk alternatives. The cinnamon raisin bagel here is also a popular item for breakfast so there's been plenty of times I needed so make a swap out for that along with regular cream cheese for reduced fat. Sad face!"
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2018-11-19,4,Your regular deli for a quick cup of coffee. Poppy cake was good.
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2018-10-09,1,"Got myself some broccoli, wings, potatoes and salad. Broccoli and wings were the WORST ever. Sorry not sorry. A deli in heart of Manhattan shouldnt have such terrible food..."

It was more expensive than I expected($9)"
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2016-12-05,1,"Got food poisoning from this place, definitely would not recommend unless you're really desperate to lose 10 pounds."
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2016-09-27,2,"Worst bacon in the world.  Every day, they just cook all the bacon before hand and let it there all morning, so when they had it to your sandwich or platter, it's like chewing on a tire. That's really the only complaint I have."
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2016-05-04,1,Co worker and I decided to grab hot buffet from this place one day and we both got terrible food poisoning! I'd stay away from this place.
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2016-02-05,3,"Standard, bland, ""new"" New York City type of deli.

No culinary epiphany here."
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2015-10-28,1,"I just bought a soup at this place and it tastes absolutely terrible!! Beside the taste, it is abnormally spicy, I do not think it is humanly possible to eat at all. I usually not a big fan of writing reviews, but this place is very disappointing in general every time I try to buy something. Please try to stay away."
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2015-03-24,5,"Veggie omelette made fresh in front of you, potatoes, whole wheat toast, and a small coffee--all for $5!?!? Yes, please!"
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2015-01-14,1,"I found FOUR chopped up segments of large bone in my curry from the buffet this afternoon.  It was as if they threw a whole (whatever animal) into the grinder and added curry to whatever came out.
I would have eaten the rest of the food I paid for (by weight), but unfortunately it was all lukewarm and terrible.  Not recommended."
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2014-10-23,1,"I recently had lunch here while doing some shopping at B&H. The place looks like the perfect shop at the corner to have lunch and it seems this place is popular for breakfast. They make sandwiches, they have a grill and also a small buffet table and you can stay since they have a couple of seats.  I decided to go with the buffet table. Big mistake. It looks tasty but after trying the food, I realized they mixed fresh cooked noodles with left overs from who knows what day. They were solid like rocks, it was disgusting. It makes me wonder if they do that with everything else. 
I do not recommend this place for lunch, at least not from the buffet. You can definitely have a much better lunch somewhere else for the same money or less."
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2014-10-09,5,"Great bacon, egg, & cheese when you've have a bit too much to drink. Also, staff is super friendly. They make every order there an experience. One of their employees even have me a cupcake when I was sad on my birthday a few years ago! This place knows how to bring in loyal customers. Truly great. I know if I ever move out of Chelsea, I'll still definitely revisit!"
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2014-08-24,5,"Love this place and the guys who run it--They are always cracking jokes while making me a sandwich or salad. In addition to solid food, they have plenty of household items you want you local bodega to have. If you are close to 30th and 9th, come here for whatever you need."
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2013-09-13,1,"Do not bother with this this place. Complained about the french fries being luke warm (they argued hot). Ordered a grilled cheese and the cheese was not melted. They gave a refund, and then followed with ""We do not want to see you here again."" 
Hey guys, how about learning how to prepare something (anything) and providing a customer service that does not isolate you in the future. I am happy to discuss any strategies that you might have in mind.

46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2012-11-23,2,"We popped in to this well-maintained shop for a necessary caffeine break and we were quickly greeted by a friendly proprietor.

The weaker than average espresso did the trick but unfortunately, the cappuccino was insipid and foam-free.

While the cupcake was tasty looking, it turned out to be brittle and dry. It might have been there a while... Can someone please go order all the cupcakes so they refresh them?"
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2012-07-28,3,Just what you need when you get off the High Line. Lots of beverage options and a small salad bar. Bathrooms [with purchase!] do the trick.

46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2011-05-06,3,"This is a bodega/cafe, salad bar with hot/cold food, and pastries. The place looked clean and well lit, I think slightly above average for its class."
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2010-07-26,3,Interesting sandwiches...definitely if you're feeling not too fancy and just want to grab a simple bite without the hassle of being waited on. I liked this place when it was in its old location. convenient. Just about every sandwich is $6.50 with a drink.
46,cafe-bravo-new-york-3,2009-06-30,3,"Not the friendliest place in the world but good for a quick coffee and baked treat. Coffee is moderately strong and provides a good jolt if one is flagging in the afternoon. Place offers sandwiches for lunch and a respectable selection of chips and other standards for lunch. Small seating area is available for diners not wanting to take their stuff back to the office. Service was quick, and the place was clean, and that's OK in my book."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2020-03-18,5,"Conventional wisdom would tell you that - given this is one of the most transient spots imaginable - service should be subpar. On the contrary - the service here is great !! Whoever the Manager of this location is, Starbucks should grab them to  train other Starbucks Managers to do what they're doing at this location. The employees are BUSY here,as would be expected, they are however upbeat, passionate and give it their all. It just seems like they're having fun. I hate most Starbucks as reflected in past reviews and have basically given up on the whole franchise but I NEEDED a caffeine blast one day on my way to work. So I stopped in this place and I'm glad I did. Kudos to the Manager here - you create a great atmosphere for the staff and they reflect it back to the customer. Big Thank you to the staff."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2020-02-27,1,"Seriously. I was waiting for just a cake pop for 20 min.
Everyone just walking around.How you can have such a care less people ."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2020-01-09,1,"The employees here are always SO nice and upbeat and this rating isn't a reflection of them in any way but damn this place get slammed.  I get that it's in Port Authority and I really only go there maybe 3x a year (always order ahead) and have regularly waited 20 minutes for my order.  Today was a 35 minute wait for just a spinach wrap making me think there is something wrong with their system.  The employee running the mobile orders was so friendly though and made sure they made my wrap after she noticed I had been waiting.  But do yourself a favor, and hit up another Starbucks unless you have the time to wait."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2020-01-06,5,"Fast Starbucks serving up quick cups for those coming right off the train or bus. They are more than likely always going to be busy thanks to the convenience of this location but I have been to much more suburban stores and had a drink take longer. They have a small seating area, this is not one you would select to work out of or meet in but for a quick charge or email check this store will do."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2019-08-11,4,"It's a busy Starbucks inside bus station. I thought it would be super busy and the baristas won't be much attentive (had such experiences before). But to my surprise I found him putting effort to ensure he gets my name right on the cup. :) 

Also I enjoyed seeing pigeons inside the store - walking around customers to scavenge food"
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2019-07-08,4,"I love going to this location as it's right inside Port Authority. The service staff are very friendly, attentive, and helpful. 

This place is always busy and keeps the cafe clean and well maintained. I am looking forward to going there again for my next caffeine fix."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2019-07-07,1,This is the worst Starbucks ever. And I had bad service before. Evertime I come here they get the order wrong. Today was no different. Never coming back here
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2019-06-13,3,Very busy Starbucks. Employees friendly and do their best. You have to walk in and understand that it's crazy busy and as a customer don't be a jerk. They are doing the best they can and they are super nice. I had to wait a little longer for my feta egg white spinach wrap but the person making it kept apologizing for the wait. They were super nice and friendly. I will keep going there. Just be patient and not a diva. Put yourself in their shoes. It's one of the busiest Starbucks in NYC.
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2019-02-24,2,The baristas have the absolute most passive attitudes. I question my sanity because I keep coming here.
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2019-01-30,1,"I've given this place plenty of chances with mobile orders, they mess up my order or its not even ready after I place my order before I enter the Lincoln tunnel, via bus of course.  The baristas that are there now are probably the ones that have lasted the longest and they are the friendly ones.  I've seen the ones with attitudes not last long at all.  For the $6/cup of lattes Starbucks charges you'd think they would have about 10-12 people suing during peek times.  Does this facilities hiring manager realize how many people go thru the Port Authority between 5:30am - 9am.  You should be ashamed of yourself paying minimum wage, you can't leave a tip on the mobile app, probably it's too much for you guys to work on.  You can only leave a tip after you close the receipt when you order.  Who has time to do that, while holding your coffee and trying to get to work.  

I took a snapshot of my wait time, the Order placed at 6:38am, it was done at 6:55am.  For this I should have just waited on the long line.  I was still there and the people that were on the line when I got there, left already.  What's the sense of ordering via mobile.
Anyway, going across the way to Au Bon Pain for coffee, going to give them a try."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-12-29,1,"I don't know if it's because it's the holidays but attitudes wow. The only person who was happy was the cashier. She was amazing today was all women and Wow is all I will say. $6.27 for a Matcha Green Tea and wasn't even full to the top and was told cause I asked for less ice really. I get this same drink in N,J and Middletown N,Y and never have a problem. Last time for me in the 42 Port not even if it's the only 1 open. Happy New Year & New Attitudes God Bless"
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-11-11,3,"This particular Starbucks always has a long line.  I've waited for 10 minutes and more to put in my order with the cashier.

Yesterday,  I used the app to place an order when I got off the E train. Once I arrived, the barista just made my drink.

Hence, I recommend using the mobile order  at this location.  You won't have to wait on the extremely long line."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-11-07,1,"If i could give zero stars i would. Not once but twice i waited more than 25 minutes for a mobile order for it to never come out. Give the girl my name show my receipt ""it's coming"". I'm done with Starbucks."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-11-06,1,"This Starbucks is one of the worst I've ever been in. Starbucks is known for its good service but this one had terrible customer service. I ordered a blueberry scone which was in the display. Typically they give these items to you right when you pay unless you request for it to be heated up in which case it takes 1-2 min tops. I waited for almost 10 min while staff talked and texted and occasionally made drinks. Finally someone came over and told me they only had strawberry scones despite having blueberry scones in their display. She offered me a refund or another item and I decided to get a chocolate croissant. Without asking me she took it to heat up causing me to wait even longer and while it was on the counter a man decided to ""clean the counter"" and brushed dirty food all over my food. I only ate it because I was in a rush and had a bus to catch. I really don't recommend this location."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-11-01,1,"The employees here are generally nice but they play music on the stereo so loud that I could not hear the person I was talking to on the phone or hear my own music on my headphone. Extremely distracting to someone trying to read, talk with a partner or just plain relax. I Brought the issue to the Managers attention and nothing was done. Very poor experience. It's a coffee shop not a night club."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-08-20,4,I had iced Vanilla Bean Coconut milk latte. It has very interesting taste and good to try for seasonal drink. The ordered was fast even it was long line.
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-07-06,1,"This is hands down the worst Starbucks in Manhattan. A handful of the staff are rude. I've seen almost daily the staff making the beverages get a customers order wrong, only to then give an attitude when the customer comes back to have their drink remade. 

Any time I come to this location, my drink is ALWAYS not full. It's a waste of money."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-06-25,1,Shitty service. Attitude and shitty music. Waste of a huge space. SBUX should be able to do more with it.
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-06-17,2,"Right inside the Port Authority !  But don't go here if you are in a hurry or Need to make your bus. 

People were nice but service is glacial. It should not take 15 minutes or so to get a drink made. And the place was not busy. 

Oh and as the person was giving me my beverage she said 'oh did you want that whipped cream' ?  I said 'yes' but I thought 'yes, that is why I asked for it'

So she took it back to add whipped cream. 

Don't go here if you are in a hurry."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-05-18,4,"I commute into the port authority every work day for the past 13 years and have been getting my morning tea from this location since the first day it opened. This week has been particularly challenging because I typically use the mobile app to order my breakfast tea however at the beginning of this week the royal English breakfast tea was out of stock and not able to be ordered. This continued into Tuesday so I stopped to inquire when that shipment would come in and I was told it had already come in. I explained that the mobile app was still indicating that it was out of stock and if they could please correct that so I may order my daily tea the following day. Much to my dismay, both Wednesday and Thursday morning I was still unable to order my tea because nobody ever adjusted the availability for the mobile app. On Thursday morning I spoke with Elon and he went into the system and adjusted the availability of the breakfast tea. When I arrived to pick up my mobile order this morning the cup was upside down indicating it was out of stock. I spoke with Elon again and he apologized for being out of stock again and despite the stock issue he was able to provide me the tea I had ordered via the mobile app. I cannot thank Elon enough for taking care of me this morning. It's the little things that people do that really start your morning off positively and Elon single-handedly started my Friday morning in a wonderful fashion. His customer service to me was exceptional and greatly appreciated. Thanks Elon!!!!!!"
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-03-14,1,"Second time here when I ordered green tea frappuccino and they just made it even though they knw they didn't have enough green tea powder. First time I let it go even taste wasnt right and today is the second time. And when I asked the employee guy that if the lady that making my tea get more powder coz i hv been waiting for awhile.  He said, he didnt make it and didnt knw where she is and gave me attitudes told me to go to register tho get refund. And i did.  Vvvvvvvvery disappointed!! But a lady at register was very nice!!"
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-03-04,3,"Definitely not my favorite Starbucks but it's conveniently located in port authority near all the greyhound buses. The line is always very long so expect a wait. I was there around 10am on a Saturday and it was very busy and took some time to get my order. Starbucks needs to invest in another shop in port authority, which could then lessen the congestion at this one."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-02-16,2,So of course this is an ideal location when you're on the go to get your coffee and a bite. Ideally since most people on the go frequent this spot you would think they would make the drinks faster and place the sandwiches in the oven for a couple minutes. I had an important meeting and came here with 30 minutes and had everything been ready since I was starvinggg and needed coffee I would have made my meeting on time. I waited 15+ minutes for a sandwich and finally spoke to someone and they never made the sandwich. Luckily one of the gentleman was kind enough as I told him I was in a hurry and gave me a refund . The frappe I ordered was awful tasted more like water with chocolate bits .
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2018-01-13,2,"This Starbucks, like the rest of Port Authority, is dismal. Homeless people taking up most of the seats, ho-hum employees. I'm always there Saturday morning and there's always one cashier, one barista and one person heating the food. That's it! The line is always long. One time I got there at 7:40am and ordered a croissant, didn't even ask for it to be warmed, and I had to bail or else I'd miss my 8am bus. The worst Starbucks ever"
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-12-20,5,Dominique is the best part about this place! We came here late after a show before our bus left and they were out of almost everything we wanted. She went out of her way to try and suggest things similar even though she was not our cashier.
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-12-01,1,"No chai tea- really starbucks? They don't even have he light chai tea latte. Makes sense, to have no healthy options. Only sugar laden beverages. Of course, they only tell me after I wait in a 10 minute line."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-11-28,2,Why is half of the staff so rude? I've see customers go out of their way to be kind and then be meet with such disdain. Why is it the customers job to lighten up the mood? I understand that working at the Port Authority must be tiring but the lack of professionalism is out of control.
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-10-28,1,I hate being delayed. I just waited 15 minutes for a coffee to be told they didn't have it. Thanks for the refund can you give me my time back please.
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-09-29,4,"Strange. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I had a great experience at the Port Authority Starbucks, so I thought it would be a good idea to post my positive experience to counter some of the poor reviews. It's my first time at this location, but I would try it again. It was about 8:30 AM on a Friday. I was a bit hesitant to try since there was a line. It moved quickly though and within no time, someone was taking my order, a bacon Gouda sandwich and a tall hot chocolate. I then expected to wait forever for my order because that has sometimes been the experience with really busy Starbucks locations. Surprisingly soon after my order was taken, my name was called for the hot chocolate and within a minute after, my breakfast sandwich was ready. There was also a barista who seemed to be dedicated to directing people and keeping the line moving. Top notch service here by organized, fast and friendly baristas. There could be more seats, but that's a drawback of the busy location and not the baristas, so one star off for the lack of seats."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-09-21,1,"I handed you a cup and asked for black coffee. You took my name, handed my cup to someone else to pour it; even though the tap was right behind you. I waited 10 minutes for you to pour coffee into a cup. That is absurd, and it happens every damn time I come here. Well this is certainly the last time I drink Starbucks. I'm not supporting a company that enacts a system that makes getting a simple cup of coffee a chore. You've lost your way."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-07-17,1,"I've come here a few times on weekends at different hours of the day and they always get my order right. 

Last week on Tuesday at around 3pm I ordered a Vanilla Cafe Frap with soy milk and no whipped cream. I'm lactose intolerant and I don't drink dairy. What I got was a Vanilla Bean Frap with whipped cream and dairy milk. 

When the barista with silver hair called my name, she was about to hand me my drink when she realized it said ""no whip"" and she blurted out, ""oh sh*t!"" Then removed the lid, scooped the whipped cream off with the lid, splashing me and my sister who was next to me, grabbed a flat lid and placed it on my drink. There was still traces of whipped cream and I couldn't drink it anymore. 

I was so shocked and angry and I wanted a refund but we were in a hurry and by now there was a longer line. 

So, not only did the cashier confuse Vanilla Cafe with Vanilla Bean, I got no caffeine, and a lot of dairy that I can't even ingest.

Next time, I will pass if I'm in town during the week. I feel that the weekend staff is much nicer and I've never had any complaints. On the contrary, I love coming here on weekends going back home to Jersey."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-07-15,1,"Soooo sloooooooow, one person making coffee, 2 at the register, long line everyone irritated.  How about paying one more employee the cost of a coffee?!  And maybe focus on the coffee instead of unhealthy sandwiches and day old pastries."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-07-12,3,"Pretty decent sized Starbucks.  

Inside the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Never had the coffee here. I Always seem to grab a vente iced green tea on the way home from a night out in the city. It never seems to make it thru the Lincoln Tunnel on the back to Jersey. Hits the spot on a warm evening.

Staff is efficient but the place could use a little bit of a cleaning , especially towards the end of the day. Good if you're a commuter and work in Midtown Manhattan . 5 or 6 tables along the wall plus a communal in the center.

What I like best is it's always open  late 12 or 1AM, 7 days a week."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-05-19,1,"Really dirty, food smeared across the floor, the bathroom was disgusting. The music was terrible too. The state of this place made it difficult to swollen my coffee and enjoy being there."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-05-03,3,"So I hate to downgrade but I had a pretty bad experience with the cashier today. I don't know if it was too loud in there or if I'm too softspoken but I basically asked for my drink to be made with coconut milk three times! I had assumed He heard me. He rang me up and just to make sure, I asked him if he had heard that I asked for coconut milk. He looked annoyed but at least he did ask the baristas to make mine with coconut milk instead without charging me extra...But geez...scared to go back. The guy who usually rings me up is super sweet and thorough though, so bummer :/"
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-04-27,1,Mocha is horrible here. It's second time when I'm drinking coffee in this Starbucks and it's second terrible coffee from here.
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-04-20,1,"I know it's a bad idea to write a review while fuming with unspeakable rage but here I am.

I've been coming to this Starbucks for years. I stopped for a while because it just became too hectic and drinks were taking upwards of 15 minutes to be ready. I recently started coming back because the weather is warming up and I wanted cold brew.

That brings me to this morning. I ordered a cold brew with soy milk, because I'm doing a vegan thing right now, but regardless of that I always drink soy or almond milk in my coffee because I'm lactose intolerant and dairy gives me a terrible reaction. Instead, they put real, probably whole milk in my coffee. I was already walking down the tunnel into the subway and there was no way I had the time or energy to turn and walk all the way back.

I cannot believe the carelessness of these employees to not make the drinks as specified. Like it's so hard to put some iced coffee and soy milk in a cup. 

I am going to keep this coffee that I spent $5 on and CAN'T DRINK next to me all day to keep this rage alive and I'm going to carry it all the way back to this location and ask that I be given a free coffee next time I'm on my way to work.

Edit: I brought my now warm, watery coffee back to this location on my way home. Asked for my money back. They agreed, without argument, and asked if I wanted the drink remade. I didn't because I wanted it at 9am not at 5pm. I don't drink coffee at night. However, I never received the refund they supposedly gave me. I keep checking my bank account and nothing. I've sworn this place off for good."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-04-15,2,"This is a big but chaotic Starbucks.

The good: Coffee is good. Cash register lineup is quick. Spacious and big environment.

The bad: People are just standing everywhere. Time between ordering and getting your coffee is long. Not the cleanest place. They left our coffee on the counter without calling it out, so we took a risk and look at the name on it to see if it was ours. Very busy place.

The place is very busy and I can understand the time of serving and such. But just dropping the coffee without calling it, and leaving it there when you see no one is picking it up is simply bad service."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-04-07,1,"I love starbucks and ive never had a problem, until i started going to this location in PABT. Understandably it is located in port authority, but the line is always so long and they have ONE cashier taking orders. And always, that ONE cashier is either talking and not paying attention or having to take care of pastry and food orders. I have never been to a starbucks (and that's just in a regular suburb area in nj) where theres not more than 2 cashiers, and someone doing the pastries and 2 people making coffees and specialty drinks. The barista is always standing there talking, and not making drinks!, while there is a long line..therefore should be asking the next persons order and getting ahead. Even the manager goofs off with the employees. I will not be getting my coffee for my commute from this location, as i will take my money and pay at dunkin donuts, where i can be in line and have my entire order within 3-4 minutes and now wait 20!! Absolutly ridiculous."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-03-18,1,"It took me all day to actually decided if I wanted to write this review, and I remind myself, this location wrecked my Saturday morning.

I asked for a small hot green tea with a scoop of matcha, booshy I know but super simple.  15 minutes of waiting I see the barista making a green tea latte.  She told me it's mine( keep in mind this chick also took my order at the register) I reminded her I asked for tea, not a latte.  The manager next to her then says put ice on it.   THE LATTE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A HOT TEA?!?!?  As I say a small prayer they then go make my drink, bring it back with 1 tea bag in a VENTI with no matcha.  Of course the staff of 10 chillin behind the counter is confused of-course. I get my drink and run for the hills.  Will never be back it's seriously the worse.  It's crazy I can get faster, more efficient AND friendlier service from McDonald's on 42nd, and that place is aSEA of confused tourist.  This whole thing took about 30 minutes.  Did I also forget to mention on another day my white mocha order came back as a cup of cold milk that tasted like vanilla?
Gerl Bye

Port authority Starbucks, get it together"
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-03-13,1,Worst starbucks in New York. There isn't a day I go there where my order isn't wrong. Today I got hot milk in a cup instead of a latte macchiato. Never going back.
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-02-28,1,I've being going to this store since they opened. Lately it's become a real zoo in the mornings. Their system is pathetic. They used to churn people through the store in record time. About 2 months ago they changed their system for serving coffee and it sucks. SUPER SLOW! Always tons of people standing around waiting for coffee (and not just the espresso drinks but regular coffee too). People everywhere and servers shouting names of customers or trying to move the line along. Not a great impression if you are new to NY. Come on Starbucks - fix this. Staff are nice though - friendly and try to get to know you if you are a regular.
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2017-01-14,1,Trash. I just had to throw my coffee away. Tasted like it was made with mop water. I'm not here often. But this is the second time I had to do this. Should of probably went to McDonald's.
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2016-12-17,1,"Ordered by mobile and the girl said they don't have a brown bag for my power lunch order. Really? People are always on the go here and you say you don't have it? And its freaking raining!!! That's BS. You didn't even check at the back. Then they didn't put banana in the little white bag they gave me so I went back and asked for it. The guy said get a banana motioning with his lips and turned his back. Really? So freaking rude. You can smile a bit, get it and hand it to me and all will be good. Why do you work here when you're all miserable? Stay at home instead!!! If this is all I get from Starbucks, then I'll just sayonara!!!"
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2016-12-14,3,This Starbucks is an a very convenient location and the baristas are moving! Despite that it took 15 minutes for my mobile order one latte and an oatmeal this morning. Risky mobile order during morning .
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2016-11-10,1,"Awful service. PSL I got was too sweet. Homeless people with mountains of bags taking up most of the seats. When I asked for a cup of water, the barista first told me to wait. I waited 20 minutes and she never addressed me again. I finally asked her again and she told me I had to get back in the super long line for it, which I know is just a lie. Save yourself some grief and go the the much friendlier Jamba Juice (next door) or Au Bon Pain (across the way) instead."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2016-10-02,1,"I work inside the terminal so having a starbucks in here its awesome,however i prefer to walk to the one outside the terminal just because this one has horrible service,always long slow lines employees always chatting and having there own party inside the counter ALL OF THEM ARE ALWAYS WITH A RUDE ATTITUDE,the ambient music its more like noise it is always way to loud for you to even hear your own thoughts so you have to scream your order out loud and not surprising 98% of the time its wrong obviously cause they cant hear you,and when you ask them to change it be ready for a dirty look and attitude."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2016-08-25,1,"Super Slow, Unsanitary(VERY Dirty).

Staff friendliness is ok but they are super slow and INEFFICIENT. They always seem to be joking around and talking amongst themselves even in the most busiest rush hours. 

DISCUSTING - Many little flies inside the food display cabinet. I always see at least one big fly inside with the food."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2016-06-27,3,"Here's the deal: it's the port authority! You are coming here because it's too early for any thing else to be open  or you're trying to catch a bus home and you're hungry and don't want to be ripped off $5 a slice for the Italian place across from this Starbucks. Look, it's Starbucks 
... it's somewhat consistent. You're not going to want to get to know your Barista! But you want him to notice you're a holding a sandwich that needs to be warmed up! You want him to get that coffee in 30 seconds or less before you swipe your card! They are good at that! Ask for basic things and it will be quick and you get your bus home or train to work. Ask for something complicated like a venti dirty chai latte misto with double shot of whatever....then you ought to be shot. They will do it, but it holds everyone else up. And they miss the bus. wtf! But yeah, if I worked a long evening, it need a hit for my stomach...yeah the coffee or panini sandwich....yum! Know your environment!"
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2016-04-27,5,"Hadsome nice guys, tasty good coffee and nice cinnamomo cakes, i enjoyed it all very much =^.^="
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2016-04-24,1,Terrible service in a convenient and high volume location. Gave me an iced grande instead of venti. When I asked he put it in a venti cup and filled the space with ice. #firstworldproblems
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2016-04-18,4,"-First Impression- Cute location inside of the PABT. Nicely lit, full displays. Every time I've been here it's been clean and well maintained.

-Food- Typical Starbucks food. Refrigerated items available as well as items normally displayed in the case. My drinks have always been prepared how I ask. 

-Service- The staff is pretty friendly for the most part. However I have noticed that there's is always ONE staffer who is always less than decent. On this particular trip, the barista who took my order was AMAZING! He was super nice, and even gave me a free cookie! Conversely, the girl who actually made my drink and gave it to me had a HUGE attitude and I could not wait to leave after encountering her!

-Price- It's Starbucks lol

-Did Not Like- This location is quite pretty small, but can we get like... two more chairs? Literally just two! And the aforementioned mean girl


-Recommended?- Yes! I always stop here when I pass through Port Authority"
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2016-04-12,4,"This is your typical Starbucks, which is now synonymous with coffee. It has the same coffee, tea, wall art and cups like all the rest. So way review it. Well this Starbucks is inside the Port Authority Bus Terminal, PABT, south wing at 40th street and 8th avenue which is Times Square period!

Which means that there is always a line and a bigger one if it's rush hour. The place is clean considering were it is and the traffic here. The staff is friendly, but there is always a big turnover due to stress and other factors. So don't expect to be flirting with same Barista or cashier after a week. 

The PABT has a lot of security, National Guard, FBI, Cops, under cover DT(s) and Jehovah's Witnesses. So are you safe?  NO!,

This is Times Square and you got crazies all over, and you got me too, so you better not step on my feet you hear. But feel comfortable in knowing that if you get punched in the face that your assailant will be pounce upon and stomp unconscious in 5 second or less. So get your Latte and zig zag around people like do to the nearest exit."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2016-01-21,1,"This is the first time in my Yelping that I've ever given one star. With that said, this has to be the worst Starbucks I've ever visited. The baristas have no regard for you. The pastry case is always empty. They are always out of something, without fail,  whenever I order. Tonight I walked up to the register and the barista was scrolling through his IG account, looking up bothered that I'd interrupted him. They were out of soy. I left empty-handed & went to the Starbucks on 39th & 8th, which, coincidentally had way better service. If you're shelling out $5 for a beverage, go to that one because port authority sbux employees don't value your dollar or your life."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2015-08-04,1,"We actually downgraded the rating for this place. The cashier Shauna is beyond pissy and has a huge attitude. Do us all a favor since you're not a people person and get a non customer service job. Starbucks corporate, stop hiring people that aren't capable of handling a simple miscommunication. I ordered a venti dark roast iced. She said OK rang me up for a hot. Then handed me a hot. I said I asked for it iced. She said no such thing. So I said fine give me a cold brew venti. She pitched a stink fit. What is her problem? She went to 2 other employees that assisted her with the change. The lady that refunded my card and recharged me accordingly was nice. She stopped sweeping to assist. Perhaps she should be serving the customers and Shauna be in the back sweeping. On top of that she walked away from her cashier after the transaction leaving a whole line of customers for one cashier... Seriously?!?"
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2015-06-04,2,"Not enough tables, and it seems like the chairs are being dragged from place to place. They need to up their game. I got about a teaspoon full of ice in my iced coffee and had to go back and ask for more. The Starbucks in East Rutherford can go through more traffic faster than this place does, and I was there on a weekend."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2014-12-21,1,"This one's for the evening crew, not the morning,  morning is chipper and fast. On a sunday I catch my bus at 6 pm, i was on line at 5:29 and when i realized there were at least 18 ppl who had already paid and were standing around just waiting for thier drinks to  be made, i decide to just get a cookie without the frappe i originally came in for.  Then finally at 5:52 it was my turn, I thought ill just get my cookie and run up, not possible.  The guy in front of me buys two bags of coffee to get a free $5gift card. For some reason the cashier doesn't know what he's talking about even though there are signs posted about this in every possible view.  I had already asked for my cookie and wanted to scan my app, but the cashier can't handle it, really?? Just hand me the damn cookie so i can go and not miss my bus.  So i had to leave, and as i left i noticed the sad sea of angry faces still waiting on thier holiday drinks."
47,starbucks-new-york-361,2014-07-09,2,"Where shall I start?  I think the Port Authority Starbucks location invented the phrase ""at a snail's pace"".  It has been open for months at this point, so I figured I would give it sometime to improve sadly it has not improved.  They finally added an order screener to improve the overall efficiency of the order/checkout process; however that is not doing the trick.  There are several Starbucks, which have insane lines, with less space and this process generally works well.  Quick ordering, quick check out and a quick order turnaround, however the Port Authority location is the worse.  Do not go here if you are on your way to work you might not make it there within the same day.  I keep my orders simple along the lines of black, no sugar, hot or iced coffee and there is no reason I should be waiting 10 minutes for a hot or iced coffee (this isn't some complicated 800 calorie drink order here).  I mean come on people you are not understaffed.  Could the issue be poor organization?  I give up!"
48,the-fashion-chef-new-york,2017-03-23,2,"I'm torn. This place was great for awhile. The staff was very attentive, the service was prompt,
the food was above average and the cashier was a joy.

What happened? They closed down for awhile  and reopened with a new staff and menu, each more sullen than the next. A meticulous ambiance-ectomy was successfully executed.

It's a pretty sure bet you'll be the only customer in the place at 12:15 and you will go unacknowledged until you wave smelling salts under the highly optioned nostrils of one of the hipster zombies whose ostensible job it is to serve you, but whose real mission is to drive you away. ""I'll have the lunch special"" (1/2 sandwich and soup or salad). ""Oh we don't have the soup right now. Or the salad. Or the 1/2 sandwich.""

Next time: ""I'll have the Black Forest ham sandwich"", which looked fantastic in the display case. So they take said sandwich into the ""back"", ostensibly to heat it up. I get periodic updates, every 15 minutes or so, that my sandwich will be ""right out"". It is grandly presented (if you call flinging it at me across the sticky counter ""grand"") in an ample cardboard container with a black plastic lid. I take same back to my desk, salivating as I unveil the deliciousness inside that... what is that? It's been subjected to some sort of miniaturizing/dessicating process. It's about the size, color and texture of an Oreo, though with an impeccable lack of flavor.

You might think I'd learned my lesson, but no, I went back one last time to find one of the display cases covered in what appeared to be a funeral shroud. I asked the poor, grimacing unfortunate with the emergency nasal relief vents, if they had any soup or sandwiches. ""Oh, we're just running a little late today"" (at 12:45 PM).

I have heard about places that deliberately fail for tax reasons or whatever. Not suggesting that's what's going on here. Just came to mind.

What the hell does their fashion look like?"
48,the-fashion-chef-new-york,2017-02-24,4,Tea was good. It comes from Harney & sons. I had a red velvet cupcake with chocolate ganache. Good flavor. I would have preferred the frosting to have been a bit creamier.
48,the-fashion-chef-new-york,2016-12-14,1,"I've worked at Industry City for the past year, and The Fashion Chef used to be a bright star in the culinary landscape of the place. They had super friendly staff, La Colombe coffee, delicious comfort food at reasonable prices, and a cute seating area. I would stop by almost daily, either for a morning latte or a soup and sandwich later in the day.

Then they closed down, and a few weeks later reopened under new management, and the current state of affairs is what's prompting me to write this review. The new Fashion Chef is a sad shadow of its former self. Well, they DO still have La Colombe coffee, so there's that. But pretty much everything else that made it a place worth going is now gone. The seating area inside has been removed, ruining the ""little café"" atmosphere. The friendly, chatty staff has been replaced with people who are indifferent at best and surly at worst. Some of the best menu items disappeared completely, and the fresh orange juice cups have shrunk 50% in size. And most ridiculously, while the soup prices stayed the same, they now fill the containers 2/3 of the way on a good day, and halfway on other days. Since I evidently need to spell this out for the management: filling a container halfway is a dishonest, shady practice. If you want to sell smaller containers, get new cups and price them accordingly. Don't deceive people into thinking they're getting a large container, and they discover that half its contents are missing after paying.
This has happened to me twice, and to 3 (yes, three) of my coworkers on separate occasions. When asked to fill the cup all the way, they responded with ""we don't usually do that"".

Uh, for real?

A quick note to the new management - just because the food choices in Industry City are limited, it doesn't mean you have a captive audience willing to put up with you. You lost 4 customers just from my company alone. Step up or make room for a better vendor."
48,the-fashion-chef-new-york,2015-09-25,4,"I happened to be in Industry City and looking for a nice spot to sit, do a little work, and charge my phone. That's how I stumbled upon The Fashion Chef, and boy am I glad I did!

It's a little café with 3 tables, but there's plenty more seating down the hall and outside. The ambiance is quite lovely. Pretty flowery wallpaper, soft music, comfy chairs, and very clean and neat appearance. I only had dessert there, but it was fantastic!! I got the molasses cookies salted caramel ice cream sandwich for $4.25, and it was more than worth it! Very fresh, well crafted, and the flavors blended very nicely. The young man behind the counter was also very welcoming and quick to help every customer that walked in. 

This was my only visit, but it was such a pleasant one that I'd definitely come back again if I'm ever in the area again."
48,the-fashion-chef-new-york,2015-07-15,5,"The best Patisserie you can find in the region, the cakes are top of the line, and the food they serve is delicious, it is amazing and the team is friendly."
48,the-fashion-chef-new-york,2015-07-09,4,"The worst part about The Fashion Chef is that they didn't have a Yelp page...until now.

I just finished devouring one of their glazed pecan rolls and I'm so angry at myself for only getting one! Fortunately, I also got their brie and fig on a cinnamon raisin bread which is absolutely heavenly.

The staff is super-friendly, the cakes are beyond real, they're more like works of art. and if they're as good as they look then they're worth every dollar ($$$). 

My only wish is that they had a larger gourmet sandwich selection. Otherwise, it's a must when you're at Industry City food hall."

waiting now for 20 minutes for one cold brew."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2020-02-20,3,Not the worst. High ceilings. Good amount of seating. Gets crowded. But nice baristas. Learned abt a sbux stars reward trick from one of them. Changed my life. Bathrooms don't always work. And not the best use of space. And gets super crowded. But I wouldn't mind coming here if I worked in the area.
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2020-01-02,1,"I've been here maybe 20 times. I have had an issue at least 15 times. It's right next to my work so it nice to be able to just run in. But there is an issue Every. Single. Time. The most simple of orders is an issue. And no one try's to help or fix it. I'm always very understanding, I served tables for 7 years I get it. But come on. I always think I'll try again but I'm definitely not going back anymore."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-12-27,1,"Horrible service and attitude never coming back here 
We ordered over $60 of food and drinks they messed up the order and got mad at us"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-12-17,1,Beautiful interior horrible costumer service. Very long wait time with zero help. There is no reason Corp should allow this location by Times Square to have so low expectations. Very crowded place that needs better management
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-11-30,2,"This location has a nice interior but is perpetually crowded and has really slow service. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and waited literally ten minutes for the bagel to get toasted, and it wasn't even good."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-10-13,1,"Clearly they don't have a sense of time: it says they open at 7am. Well it's 7:15am, we are standing outside, employees can see us and they said they're not open yet..what????"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-10-05,2,"Unfortunately this Starbucks is simply inconsistent in service. Sometimes you'll get a friendly barista and other times an impatient or inexperienced one who doesn't know how to ring you up. Also considering it's a high traffic location between Times Square and Herald Square, the wait here can be up to 20 minutes to get a drink, especially during afternoon happy hours when there's even more of a rush. They need to work on customer service and also efficiency of service--sometimes I walk further to a different Starbucks so I can get my drink faster."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-09-26,1,"Horrible Customer Service

A few people and I just saw and experienced an unbelievable horrific customer service at Starbucks that I feel this should be shared. The employee with a beard ""preparing the coffees"" was dragging himself at the most useless slow productive possible way, piling up orders and dropping coffees without calling names and just creating confusion. 

He clearly does not want to be there. Upon a few requests about orders, rude and disrespectfully he slurs some words to the people and me and did not take responsibility for his actions. People were disgusted. Those people and I won't be returning there for sure. This was not the first time there. 

A store on such location should properly evaluate their employees - AND CUSTOMERS. Of course, our coffees were made wrong and we wasted a long time there."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-09-06,1,"Horrible expereince in this store! Visited on Thu, Sep 5 2019 around 1:25pm. Purchased a cup of coffee. Asked a free brewed coffee refill. This small, heavy-makeup, black cashier girl (not many hair, straight low bun hairstyle) said you have to stay for two hours so you just can get one coffee refill. I was like what??(non-sense) Then she changed to say we dont offer coffee refill if you were not from here. Very rude and unprofessional!!"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-08-19,5,"This morning was unbearably hot, summer is in full swing. I decided to give this Starbucks location a try again, and glad I did! I ordered a venti iced coffee, and received it within minutes. The staff seem organized and the morning flow was effortless."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-08-12,1,This Starbucks is so slow. There is always a backlog regardless of the time of day. The employees have no sense of urgency and the music is always too loud.
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-08-11,2,Starbucks is Starbucks so there's not much to say about this location there than the fact that it's pretty big. The bar area is in a circular shape with a few espresso machines but for some reason they only run one each and every time I'm here which causes you to wait forever for a drink even if it's been ordered in advanced on the mobile app. What's going on guys?!
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-07-19,1,"I ordered a java chip frap and I never seen it look like this before. I did however order it to be extra thick which requires a little extra ice, but every time I order it like this at other Starbucks it comes out perfectly fine. I mentioned it to the guy who made it and he didn't even bother to correct it. I think he added vanilla pumps because I clearly saw him pump white fluid into the blender instead of the mocha pump, hence the white color. Waited 40 minutes only to have my drink wrong and given attitude. Don't go here. They're all over the place."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-06-14,1,"Honestly the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. The service is slow...and they have atleast 10 people working which makes no sense. EVerytime I have been here, either my drink is wrong or I have to wait 30 minutes for my drink. This is awful. This morning I waited for what seemd like forever. I got there at 8am and didnt get my drink and leave until 8:25 and I have to be at work at 8:30. Mind you, everyone who ordered AFTER me all left before. 
Never again will I come back here."

I am so aggravated, i never had so many issues at one starbucks before...Its bad enough  I HAVE TO ASK FOR THE DAM ALMOND milk because they are hiding it, but i have to speak really loudly when i ask, because nobody will hear me. Then yesterday instead of giving me the dam almond milk, the woman is holding it , wont give it t ok me, amd pours it into my coffee, I wasnt planning on stealing the dam carafe of friggin almond milk dammit. I  dont come in disheveled, i  come in with business clothes. What the hell will it take to be treated like the other customers, should i bust through on a dam Lamborghini.  What will it take from starbucks to hand me the dam almond milk so i can pour it myself, the way i want, the amount i want. Why is this a constant problem. Pret a manger does not do this to their customers!!!!! Stop it or i wont come back"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-05-16,1,"Went in yesterday around 3:15pm and walked out at 3:45pm. They are unbelievably slow and disorganized at this location. After 20 minutes of waiting (gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was busy), I told a barista I had been waiting for a long time. He asked what I ordered and said he'd make it in a few minutes. It's like they didn't even have a record of my order and of course they didn't give me a receipt so I had no proof. I will not be returning to this location."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-05-13,1,"Tried to order a green tea lemonade, no ice, but the cashier display said Matcha so I asked the barista if it's the same thing. The barista told me with full confidence matcha is just how they label green tea in the system. Ended up getting a real powdery matcha drink with lemonade, with ice. You can imagine how it tasted."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-05-03,3,"God, finally!!! They put a different barista called ""Jay"" today to handle the coffees and she killed it! Fast and efficient... Pleaaase keep her there!"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-04-30,3,"Employees are very noisy. Music is annoying and too loud. Wifi though connected, doesn't work.

Not much of a selection as other locations.
Door is God awful difficult to open. Needs new management.

On a positive note, it has a lovely view, is spacious and looks nice.
Has potential."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-04-04,4,"People need to calm down with their negative reviews about this location. It's Times Square! If you want fast service, order ahead on your mobile app or go somewhere else. There's a Starbucks on almost every block in NYC. No need to trash talk this place because they're swamped with so many customers. Coming from someone who's worked behind the counter at one point, here's my honest review of the place:

1. It's spacious. I love doing work here. You can set yourself up at the long tables by the window or sit on one of the couches. You can always rely on Starbucks Wifi. 

2. It's super clean! And that's really what counts and shows that the staff are fulfilling their responsibilities. The tables are clean. The floors are clean. And the countertop with the napkins/straws/milk is pristine. 

TIPS:

Yes, it gets crowded! So take advantage of the mobile app.

If you want to come here to do work, you're guaranteed a seat after 6 pm. Note: This is the only place to do work that is still open past 6 pm. Gregory's next door closes at 6 pm and Cafe Grumpy closes at 8 pm."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-03-14,2,"I l... l... l... loath Starbucks. I mean Stammerbucks.

This Sbux had closed down their bathrooms but I snuck in there anyway and convinced one of the employees to let me into the employee bathroom which was very nice of them.

They seemed annoyed to do it but they let me go and that's good because there was about to be a major tragedy of the soiled underwear variety.

People get a little bit inhuman when they're closed into sardine type spaces. It's a shame."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2019-03-08,2,"Please just organize your mobile ordering already!

I've been going to this location for almost two years and during the morning rush the mobile ordering is a disaster. There are frequently dozens of customers waiting for drinks and dozens for drinks just sitting there. I assume they belong together...

A few suggestions:

1. Clear separation of duties. Have someone be responsible for just distributing the drinks and have other people responsible for making the drinks. Right now, everyone is just running around doing whatever the most urgent thing is. 

2.  More staff. It doesn't have to be much, but adding just one or two more people dedicated to mobile order fulfillment would make a huge difference during the peak times. 

3. Consider just letting customers grab their own drinks like many other Starbucks instead of having an employee distribute them. 

4. This is a decent sized location, but everything is crammed into one tiny bottle necked section (mobile orders, regular orders, toppings, etc.). Spreading things out a bit might help with congestion."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-12-26,4,I was here in the morning and it was perfect!  5 people in line in front of me and I had my drink in my hand in less than 4 minutes.  I have waited 30 minutes in places like Orlando.  Staff was pleasant and smiled. Much more space than most of the Starbucks in NYC. Come try it out!
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-11-29,1,"Worst experience ever at a Starbucks anywhere!!  We arrived at 10:30 on a Sunday and found that one section of counter seating was closed as they were washing the floor.  Okay.  They don't close until 11, but whatever.  Ordered our drinks/food and found seats at the other counter section.  Five minutes later, the employee comes over and announces that our counter section was now closed and we had to move.  What??  There's nowhere else to sit, so we left and found a spot to sit outside, which wasn't ideal but at least it was a decent night.  Will NEVER return to this location. Terrible customer service."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-11-01,4,"I was recently surprised with the upgrade in customer service at this Starbucks location. Previously, I was very upset with the lack of customer service and regard the employees had, esp during the craziest hours. But recently i have noticed the increase in customer service and urgency. I even revived a gift card for a refund because my food was taking too long. Hopefully this keeps!"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-10-13,1,"I've never written a review for a Starbucks location. What could you possibly complain about? Customer service? Usually solid in my opinion. It's coffee. Shrugs. Quality of drinks? I stick to caramel frappes. I don't need 10 pumps of goat milk, 25 Equals, with 10 M&M's sprinkled on top. Wait time? It's Starbucks, you expect to wait a little BUT NOT ALMOST 40 MINUTES!!!

It was 6pm. Never in a million years was I thinking, I'm going to wait almost 40 minutes at a Starbucks for a TALL caramel frappucino at 6pm! 

First, the line was sort of long from the moment I walked in. I decided to stay. From experience, these lines will usually go quickly as they'll have more than 1 person behind the register. Not today. There was one girl moving at a beyond glacial pace on register duty and the other employees were barely working. They showed such little urgency. It was frustrating to watch. When I was finally called up to place the order, the girl said something like, ""Who's next? Step up to best!"" *rolls eyes*

When I got my drink, I bolted out of there! That was my grave mistake. I took a sip of my drink and it tasted like there was pure, ground coffee beans at the bottom. That and it appeared a block of ice was in the middle. It was the nastiest caramel frappe I'd ever had. I was on my way to a class and needed the caffeine. I didn't throw it away until the class was over and the ice was still there. It hadn't melted. I took one sip of the drink.

My experience was so bad, I felt compelled to CALL Starbucks customer service and wait 10 minutes to speak with someone. The agent offered me a refund ONLY if I'd paid with my sbux card. Of course, this was the one time I used my debit. She couldn't reimburse me. I wasted $5.39 on a drink I took one sip of. 

Never again with this location. It's a shame people who work around the area have to depend on this sbux for their daily fix. I could never."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-10-11,1,"Terrible staff - rude and lazy. Always mess up mobile orders and never, ever apologize or accommodate. Too bad because I like sbux coffee. One on 39th and 8th isn't much better. I wish there was more oversight on the staff."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-10-11,1,I wish I could give less than one star. They made me the most disgusting drink and when I told them that I didn't think it was the tea I asked for they told me it definitely was and wouldn't remake it. I told them it should just be peach tea with lemonade they rattled off a bunch of things that should be in it-told me they were all there-and said that what I tasted wasn't even a flavor there so I must be wrong. Now I'm stuck with an overpriced drink that I can't even have!
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-09-12,3,"Okay, I've had long wait times at this starbucks on occasion. Maybe 10-15 max. Doesn't happen every time. Would not recommend going during peak hours. Otherwise, the baristas are usually friendly, they move the ordering line quickly but it gets backed up making drinks. The drinks are as expected and I haven't had any particularly bad experiences here. There is a good amount of seating at this location. Menu as expected."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-08-03,1,"Every day since they've opened I order through the mobile app. Every day I go and the employees at the mobile area are yelling out the names on the cups in the slowest possible fashion instead of just asking the people in front of them what their names are. And then they get distracted. They call 2 names, get distracted. Call the names of new drinks coming in, get distracted. More and more drinks are coming, more and more people are waiting.... 

Literally all they have to do is ask the people waiting in front of them  ""What is your name?"" and bam, they get their drink and leave. I wait for a max of 5 minutes of them not asking me my name until I yell ""I SEE MY DRINKS CAN I JUST GRAB THEM PLEASE?!""  - and people do rudely just grab their own drinks - but how rude is it if they've been standing there forever and see their drinks and just want to get the f. out of Starbucks?"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-07-23,1,"This is a complaint about Julian, who was working as a barista on Monday the 23rd.  I ordered a cold brew, and after seeing people who ordered after me get their drink before me, I politely asked him if he could check on my drink for me.  He said no, there are too many drinks on order, and turned away from me.  Rude and obviously doesn't care about making Starbucks money."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-07-14,1,Terrible service.  Never have my mobile order ready after 10 mins.  Rude and even missing key orders.  Starbucks management should know how careless their employees are at this location!  Part of the appeal of Starbucks is knowing I will have a reliable product made to my specs.  Nothing that happens here!
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-07-03,1,"Let me preface this by saying I know this is Times Square.

We ordered 5 drinks and 2 cake pops
We ordered some regular menu items
ie caramel macchiato, caramel frapp, vanilla frapps.

I LEGIT waited and (no lie I counted)
23 people received their drinks before I did.

I spent 40+ minutes here waiting for the drinks.

I get that the volume is higher due to proximity, but I feel like if I ordered before 23 other people my drink should be top or higher priority.


Additionally, my wife needed to use the restroom (she's pregnant) 
Guy said no more people could go. He then proceeds to allow some dude through and another pregnant woman (further along)
My wife asked if she could go, the guys still said no. Only after she said she had seen him let people go through did he allow her to use the restroom.

We weren't asking for special treatment for being pregnant, just showing the culture in the store.

I would give zero stars if possible."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-07-01,1,"The worst, slowest service I've experienced at any Starbucks. Three guys on the floor and they are extremely slow, don't offer to help the customers right in front of them. Pick a different store."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-06-15,5,"Friendly and fast service mid-afternoon on a weekday is a rarity, but that's exactly what I got when I ordered from this location this past Monday."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-06-15,1,"Wow, if you want to deal with mentally disabled employees who are unable to take orders and don't know anything on there own menu this is the place to go. After screwing my order up 4 time in a row and in the end still giving me the wrong size I am amazed at how disabled these workers are. 

Had to convince the cashier that a venti is a largest size not the smallest"

May 29, the place is closing early for sensitivity training - kudos, but maybe you need to close early tomorrow for actual Starbucks employee training! Waiting 20 mins and nothing - they lost my order. Staff is rude, giving attitudes to anyone inquiring about orders or asking for their order correct. 

Domo specifically gave attitude to a woman who explained to her she asked for no foam. I think her exact words were ""ok so cappuccinos have foam"" and then responded with so you should have ordered a latte.....Ron was at least trying to remedy the mayhem. Starbucks..you make enough money, get it together!!!!"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-04-21,1,Awful.  Bathroom floor was covered in diapers and toilet paper.  Drinks took 15+ minutes to make.  Get it together people.

49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-03-20,1,"If I could give 0 stars I would. HORRIBLE SERVICE by far easily the worst service I have ever received at a Starbucks. First, there's like 10+ employees standing around doing nothing so I ask one of them behind the counter for some water; she said I had to wait in line. I wait in a long line, get to the front to order water and she shoves a cup in my face and walks away... and says pour it yourself over there. I had also ordered a latte with coconut milk, she gives me almond milk. I then ask her to remake it with coconut milk and they use real milk. I can taste the difference."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-03-19,1,"Great location.  Worst management and employees.    All low level min wage that look unhappy to be there and translate their bad attitude to the customers.   

The whole place has the 'I don't give a shit' vibe.   I'll try another place for my coffee."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-03-05,4,"Fast lines and lots of employees. Great location in the Garment District. Lots to do and see in this neighborhood for tourists. 
Table Counters were clean regardless of the fact it's busy in here. The condiments area needed to be cleaned but I just grabbed my stir stick, sweet and low, and was gone. 
Great relaxing music playing overhead. Coffee was delicious and tasted fresh. Hey! It's Starbucks what more can I say. I need my afternoon cup of Joe!"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-02-10,1,"You're better off finding a different location, you wait at least 15 minutes after placing a mobile order and the staff could care less. This location is so spacious and convenient but it's like staff purposely makes your drink wrong. Starbucks has their ""barista promise"" but if you ask to have your drink remade, it always results in an eye roll and huff by the barista."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-02-07,1,"conveniently next to subway but staff acts unprofessional and they are often on their phones when customers waiting for drinks. don't go here if you're in a hurry, at least 15 minute wait for them to make a drink after ordering.

update: still sh*tty location. ordered mobile took 20 minutes to make (i stood there for 15) 3 different employees asked what i was waiting for and none of them did anything. starbucks should clean house at this location including management."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-02-06,2,"Waited 30 minutes to get my drink. I finally got up when I noticed several ppl that came after me have gotten their drinks and when I complained I was greeted by an eye roll. I waited few more names get called so I asked again to which she replied ""I'm making it"" with another eye roll. No apologies, no pleasantry. 
30 minutes at Starbucks!?"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2018-01-09,5,"Busy location right off the subway, but the wait is no longer than any other Starbucks in midtown. Great place to wait and meet up with friends before you head out."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-12-29,1,I'm a Starbucks lover. Been to many in a few states & staff is always friendly. This location has the worst Starbucks experience ever!!! Staff is very rude. They need to learn how to talk to customers.
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-12-04,1,"Literally the worst sbux ever. Employees are extremely slow and waste time chit chatting while there are many people waiting for drinks. When you finally get your drink, it's wrong half the time. Don't go here."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-11-15,4,A hidden bucks! Lol but seriously with all the scafolding i didn't even realize there is one on the corner by duane reade and cvs. Well what can i say? It is a big and clean Starbucks with lots of seating and free water refill station. Love the interior with the rustic wood. This location is pretty new compare to the always crowded one 3 blocks away so if you don't like the crowd there then go to this one instead.
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-09-30,3,"Okay - I'm super glad to have a Starbucks near my job as having to travel a few blocks for one in Midtown is semi-insane. 

In the morning, this place is a complete madhouse and extremely chaotic. Long wait for orders, if you order via the app that can be an even longer wait. Also, I've seen employees talk I'll or mention how disgusting a customer drink is while they are making it. 

One plus- this interior is quite nice, and after the rush, this is the perfect place to enjoy tea."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-09-28,1,Workers (NOT!) here are the laziest. They have 15 customers lined up with 3 cashiers and 2 on the side separating the tips. Really? You can't do this after rush hour? Why does it take 10 mins to give me a Tall Pike? The coffee's already made. Just pour in the cup. They're the slowest in making drinks. There's no sense of urgency. Pumping the syrup takes so much effort you wonder if this is a coffee place because ALL of them look like they took a tranquilizer or a sedative. They do the bare minimum and where's the manager? You don't see your lazy crew? That's a reflection on you. So many bad reviews and nothing done! He/She should be FIRED! You're a disgrace to StarBucks! I love SB but your coffee isn't all that to waste my time. Too many places that serve coffee. Would love to give you my $ every morning but I have to get to work! Unlike the people you hire in this place I have work ethics.
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-09-28,1,"I have been at this Starbucks almost every morning since this location opened as I work upstairs. Understandably so in the middle of time square first thing in the morning during the rush I am expecting to wait 10-15 minutes maybe for my order. I am a patient person and this is understandable. Today I went at 10:05 am to find the place practically empty so I expected to be in and out. Instead I waited 35 MINUTES for 1 warmed blueberry muffin. After about 15 minutes I politely asked a staff member behind the bar if they could check on my order. She asked if I had ordered on the mobile app to which I said no and she therefore ignored me. I asked another staff member to check on my order and she then shouted over to the staff to make another blueberry muffin. After another 15 minutes I had absolutely had it and finally someone was attentive to me and warmed up a muffin and handed it directly to me, which took all of 90 seconds considering I was the only one even waiting for anything. My coworkers and I have spent hundreds of dollars here but they've officially lost my business. I'd rather starve then spend my money and deal with the staff here again"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-09-23,1,Shitest starbuck that I have ever been to in my fucking life they have the rudest fucking manager I have ever meet she was disrespectful as fuck I had a simple question and did not need a rude snotty ass response if this is how they treat their customers I hope the get shut down soon
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-09-14,1,"Been here ~5 times since it's a block away from work.  All times I waited 15+ minutes, 2 of those times my order was lost and I waited for 30+ minutes.  Understood that it's busy, but that's ridiculous."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-09-09,4,"New and super clean Bux with ample seating that's great for a mtg or to just take a break from the craziness of Times Square. Service is polite but your drink might take a smidgeon longer than other Bux due to sheer volume of customers. 

The decor is nice, which is fun and different. They have all the usual Bux items including the Nitro cold brew, which not every Bux offers. This place should get a million stars for offering a water fountain at milk station. So you can refill your bottle or cup of ice. I'm a big water fan.

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that you could even meet a first casual internet date here without judgement. I really like the island bar, it gives a sense of openness. Finally, the restroom has a code, which mitigates the grossness."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-09-02,1,"The people here are hella rude and the guys act like their job is so hard, they applied for it so they should appreciate it. They need to fix the attitudes"
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-08-07,1,Why does it take 10 mins to start making a drink and there are 10 people behind the counter? Very careless staff.
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-08-06,2,"The store opened about one month ago, and it's somewhat difficult to find due to the construction around it. However, The inside layout is phenomenal. There is a lot of space for a ground floor coffee shop, and many areas to work.

However, they kept on messing up the order. The barista's were trying to push off the fault of the cashiers, and were very defensive. However, they eventually remade my order.

The caps of the drinks were also consistently messy."
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-07-18,1,One star is still too much for their poor service. They don't know how to care customers. Every single order was wrong making. I will Never Never go there anymore. Rude. Not friendly. Mistakes.
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-07-15,2,Staffs don't know what they're doing. Too many mistakes with drink orders. Saw too many customers having issues with their drinks made wrong
49,starbucks-new-york-516,2017-07-12,3,"Seem to be on a Starbucks kick lately...

Just opened maybe 6 weeks ago. Very large store. In the area of Urban Eats. It looks like the newer Starbucks have that Nitro cold brew that I've had recently at another store. This time I grabbed a Grande nitro brew with sweet cream and yes, it is quite strong. Wifey had a teavana shaken tea. Iced Green tea with strawberry. Definitely wakes up The tastebuds. 

This place is kind of hard to find due to construction all around the block. As this Starbucks is under a scaffolding and is set back a little from the street. 

You can throw a stick and find many of these Starbucks in the Midtown Manhattan / Theater District. But that nitro is not available in others that I've visited recently."
50,pret-a-manger-new-york-94,2020-02-08,1,"Jack is a horrible cashier.
Horrible customer service.
Best way to come and record everything there. Disrespectful and uncultural.would not recommend"
50,pret-a-manger-new-york-94,2020-01-05,2,"Okay so this review isn't for this location specifically, it's just for all of them . I have a huge dislike for mayonnaise and I cannot stand that THEY PUT MAYO IN EVERY  SANDWICH !!! (Except for the balsamic chicken sandwich). It's either pure  mayo or a flavored mayo in every single thing . This place literally has like 384738 kinds of sandwiches and wraps, why do all of them need to have mayo ? Now I may be biased as a rare American who doesn't like mayo, but honestly even if I did like it, I wouldn't want it pre-dispensed on my sandwich because it makes it soggy , and different people have different preferences about how much mayo they want on a sandwich so why can't they just make it separate in little packets?!? ? I've asked before if they can make me a sandwich without it (instead of grabbing the ready made one) if I was willing to wait and they said they can't do it. And the thing is they put it on types of sandwiches that normally don't even go with mayo (like who puts it on a prosciutto sandwich? A grilled cheese ? A Mediterranean sandwich ? Like wtf ?) ok mayo rant over .  It's a shame because I otherwise really like this place considering the food is fresh, healthier than many other local places, and tastes good aside from the mayo issue,  and I love that it's ready to grab and go because I'm always in a rush for lunch. 2 stars given only because they have fast service and I still go there for oatmeal and tomato soup lol."
50,pret-a-manger-new-york-94,2019-08-24,5,While in NYC THIS is Your fast food go to! This location has kind employees that meet your needs without question. They have a vast array of choices. I picked the Lobster Salad. It was amazing. Almost amazing enough to head from NJ to NY just to have salad. With healthy choices and fast food THIS is your go to spot.
50,pret-a-manger-new-york-94,2019-08-04,4,"A great experience the sandwich was great and the staff was really nice, the place is all good and clean, the only thing which is little offsetting are the bathrooms."
50,pret-a-manger-new-york-94,2019-05-22,4,"This is a convenient spot to grab a healthy meal/snack, or treat right near Port Authority. I am in this area a lot and love stopping in here. There coffee is pretty good. I have had their regular coffee and espresso here. Personally, I prefer Starbucks, but it is still good coffee! Their pastries here are good and they have a very large selection of pre-made meals. I like the variety of hot and cold options. I have had their salads and wraps and both are a perfect size! I always leave satisfied but not too full.

A lot of quick service type restaurants in this area do not have a ton of seating. I am happy to report that there are a lot of tables here! I have never had a hard time finding a seat. The design of the restaurant is new and modern and it has always been clean when I have been there. Today, I had an iced latte and one of their yogurt parfaits! I highly recommend the yogurt parfait with apples, granola, greek yogurt, and brown sugar syrup at the bottom. It was a great afternoon snack!! Overall, this is a good place to grab a quick and yummy meal or snack if you are in the midtown area."
50,pret-a-manger-new-york-94,2019-04-08,3,"I wanted a salad and this was steps from our hotel. I would say Pret is like a fancier Panera. There were slim picking when we popped in but they had what we wanted; chefs salad for me and a mini cheese and ham sandwich and turkey chili for mom. The salad was okay, the best part was the cherry tomatoes and turkey, the tomatoes were super sweet and the turkey salty, created a nice juxtaposition. The egg tasted like one of those hard boiled ones you buy in the grocery store, little too much mixed greens for me but it was edible. Not bad but Panera definitely has them beat for salad. My mom liked the sandwich; simple and good. The chili wasn't bad either, I thought it was nice, the flavors weren't competing with each other, they balanced each other out well. I think the highlight was the brownie, it was fudge and decadent. For 1.79, you can't beat it."
50,pret-a-manger-new-york-94,2019-03-27,5,My favorite Pret. They always have fun games to play like a spinning wheel or pick a cup. Panda and the rest of the staff are courteous. I go to this one daily now of all the Prets in the city because the staff are so nice and the place is so clean.
50,pret-a-manger-new-york-94,2019-02-27,3,The ice coffee was decent but u have to put your own cream and sugar and milk over at the bar.
51,natura-cafè-new-york-2,2020-02-22,4,"We stopped in for a late lunch before heading up to our room on Friday. The two individuals working were so friendly. We had the strawberry salad , avocado toast and the burrito bowl. I felt it was normal pricing for each item. Our friend loved the burrito bowl and it was a decent portion. The avocado toast had a generous amount of avocado on it. The toppings added gave it a lot of flavor. The toast was veryyy hard on the crust. I ended up throwing out some of it because I couldn't bite into it. The salad was good and did taste fresh. They had complimentary fruit water which was yummy. They give real utensils and do bring the food out to you which is nice. Place was pretty clean and had a pretty big list of options."
51,natura-cafè-new-york-2,2019-11-17,2,"Overall everything is just ""ok"" - ok food, a bit pricey for the portion size, ok service.

This cafe is located inside the Dream Downtown hotel so I came here to get lunch while waiting for my room to be ready. It was a good space to work since there were plenty of outlets, good lighting, and ample table space. However, the experience as a place to eat wasn't great.

I ordered a 3 egg omelette and a vanilla latte. The 3 egg omelette covered less than half of the plate and the latte was a standard size. They weren't particularly fancy or delicious, and I don't believe the setting is special. The two things cost me almost $25 total (including tax and 15% tip)!

You order at the counter and then take your numbers to any available table. The staff serve the food to your table. My latte was forgotten so I had to remind them about it. I wouldn't have minded so much if the staff members were trying their best or the place was super busy, but the staff members were chatting with each other a lot of the time and clearly not attentive to the patrons. The place wasn't busy at all.

Natura was a convenient place to chill near the hotel, but I wouldn't really consider coming back unless I saw a change in attitude of the staff."
51,natura-cafè-new-york-2,2019-10-13,2,This place has a fairly decent design. But that's pretty much the only positive thing I could say about it. The staff looks half asleep. The music is too loud. And the food is just meh and overpriced.
51,natura-cafè-new-york-2,2019-06-30,1,Spent $20+ on avocado toast and a small drip coffee and they offer no refills. Should have gone to Starbucks instead.
51,natura-cafè-new-york-2,2019-06-18,2,"The pancakes were great, but the coffee was really awful. Not sure if I just came on a bad day, but it tastes pretty acidic and a bit burnt."
51,natura-cafè-new-york-2,2019-03-16,2,"Natura Having a bad day or just too cool
For school? Popped in for a burger. It arrived 20mins after ordering - raw, as did the couple next to me's burgers. They got a refund and left. I stayed and gave them another shot. 2nd time lucky but the staff were too interested in looking fabulous and making sure the right songs were playing that no one apologised or offered any compensation. Food 4/10 Service 1/10
Give it a miss."
51,natura-cafè-new-york-2,2019-03-15,3,Pretty similar experience to the second and previous reviewer. Very good food and good experience but indifferent at best service. The young woman behind the counter was obviously overworked and a little stressed because the manager was too busy standing two feet away adjusting his man bun and talking on the phone. I was here three months ago- same experience.
51,natura-cafè-new-york-2,2018-10-24,2,Great food. Incredibly rude girl at the counter two days in a row. Manager didn't seem concerned about the way she treated customers. Would give 5 stars for the food if they worked on treating customers with respect.
51,natura-cafè-new-york-2,2018-10-16,5,"Natura Cafe is a great new heathy addition to the neighborhood! They have a tons of delicious, healthy options. I ordered the avocado toast and it did not disappoint. Definitely walk in and try this place out. You'll be happy you did!!"
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2020-03-05,4,"Though this location has poor ratings, the staff is very good, is specially with the situations they have to deal with. Think about the constant barrage of tourists being rude, indigent peoples crowding the tables and benches away from regular customers/commuters,  every single day. My order is always correct and the one time it wasn't it was fixed immediately.  One day I came in super thirsty and the barista/cashier suggested I try 1 of their new iced tea lemonades, I think it was guava. As a devout iced coffee drinker I went out on a limb and it was amazing. If you can block out a lot of the confusion that may surround this little location, you can get a decent drink or bite to eat here."
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2020-03-02,1,Workers talk to each and forget what they have to do. Order my drink and croissant through the app my drink was ready but my croissant wasn't because of TALKING TO EACH OTHER so I had to wait. This is every time I order.
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2020-02-02,1,"Ordered a Matcha Green Tea Latte -- the girl made the completely wrong drink the first time and it was brown and yellow. She apologized and said she will make it right -- she comes back with a watery, dark green drink that has massive clumps of Matcha dispersed throughout the drink. I have had this drink at many Starbucks before, and this was literally so far from correct I had to laugh. I'm not one to complain but this was the worst effort I've ever seen from a staff and you'll do yourself a favor staying far away from here. The employees will  be happy too cause they have absolutely no interest in working."
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-12-15,3,Located inside PENN station  2 sides with one from inside Amtrak seating . Not as busy as you would expect on a Sunday morning and the new cashier had no idea on a London Fog until Ruby who seemed to run everything told her what it was after she herself said no. Ruby seems to have a bit of an attitude but with the other staff milking around all asking questions maybe she neeeded to. Took longer than my Reston Va  location which is busier . Everyone needs a training class
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-11-27,1,Rude employees who made my drink wrong and when I corrected them and asked them nicely to remake it they both attacked me for saying I never ordered that when I had a receipt. Extremely rude and not professional. Bad attitude and bad service.
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-10-03,1,Slowest service ever!!! They never make your drink right then get an attitude when you ask them to remake your drink!! It's just disgusting
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-09-23,2,Horrible service. Crowds.  Long waits. Overworked staff.  My drink is never good here.   I gotta start grabbing coffee before I get to Penn station. Blargh.
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-08-20,5,Going to this Starbucks before jumping on my train to work honestly is a great way to start off my day! They have the friendliest staff that truly cares about their customers orders! It is busy all of the time but they work so hard and get orders out quick!
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-08-12,1,"This Starbucks is perfect for Penn station because, like the station itself, it is absolute sh-t. Literally 8 people working and only two were making drinks, the others were standing around chatting. Starbucks is always quick at other locations, and this one does the company disservice. Today was the second time I almost missed my train because ordering 20 minutes in advance wasn't long enough. Will not visit again."
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-08-04,1,"I've been to this Starbucks enough times and the employees are friendly. However, they always forget my order. I always order a spinach feta wrap. 15 minutes later, everyone else who've ordered after me have gotten what they paid for except me. I then proceed to ask them about my order and the employees are all asking around and looking at one another to see if anyone knows what I'm talking about. One of them then tells me they are working on it and I see one of the employees grab it from the fridge and place it into the microwave. This has happened 5 times up until this review. There seems to be a clear breakdown in communication and lack of efficient workflow. Also, this last time, the bag they put my wrap in ripped and it fell on the floor. I nearly missed my train waiting for them to figure out how to put a wrap in the microwave, so I couldn't go back to ask them to replace. I'm by all means not a bad customer, so I can't imagine that's why my orders are never ready. I always say please and thank you."
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-07-26,1,It took 17 minutes to make my grande flat white. One barista made the drink while three others chatted with her. I almost missed my train.
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-07-20,4,"I travel through penn station a lot and been waiting for one of these massive Starbucks to pop up on the main floor. I see them in Europe all the time and was shocked where the other location mostly focus on the LIRR passengers. Now NJT and Amtrak passengers can have a breather. 
The coffee is typical SB but somehow just a little better than the brew downstairs.

The egg sandwich seems better than Pret."
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-07-08,5,"Honestly, these were the nicest, friendliest starbucks employees I've encountered in a long time. Daniel took our order, and he was incredibly polite and kind. Could be a tiny bit tidier, but honestly, considering it's in the middle of Penn Station and is probably inundated with people at all hours, it wasn't bad."
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-07-02,1,"Employees grab the  lids bare handed where you put your mouth, and have the worst attitude I've ever experienced in any coffee shop
""Yoyoyo, Heeeeey, take it!"" Is one of the ways they will address you
If your job involves interacting with customers rude attitude and hating  people/your job is one thing but  unsanitary conditions are unacceptable
I will place a complaint in writing to the Department of Health"
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-06-16,1,"Just had the worse experience with the employees here. Was running late to the train and just asked them nicely to check on the status but got attitude from this one girl instead. She told me to wait and turned her back on me. Then, like one minute later, I saw my order come out and had asked another lady if she could please check the order for me and she also gave me a hard time, which by the way did end up being my order. What's so hard about responding to a simple question politely? To management: please hire competent employees who don't just huddle around like a bunch of lost kids and don't know how to deal with customers. To customers: If you can, try to do mobile order so that you don't have to deal with these kinds of people, save yourself the attitude.

On another note, how hard is it to warm up a bagel? I know a manager who has worked at Starbucks for several years and told me that it takes 15 seconds to warm up a bagel, I really don't understand how it took 20 minutes for me to receive my order?... 5-10 minutes is acceptable but 20 minutes, really?"
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-04-20,1,Very rude staff. One cash register was down and we were told to walk around to the other side and get on line there instead of the counterin thempassenher waiting area. Skip this place!
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-03-24,3,"Good service for the most part and really friendly staff, but they messed up my partner's drink two days in a row. There was not a lot of people in line, especially considering this was in Penn Station, yet it seems like it took them so long to fix her drink. Despite having plenty of staff this is just annoying. There are many Starbucks in NYC, so unless I am already at Penn Station I will go somewhere else for a drink."
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-02-26,3,"They never have anything. All of the specialty drinks and everything they serve they're just always out of everything. And they need to update their menu. Besides that, the staff is always very friendly and pleasant."
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-02-23,4,Fast and friendly although cashier was yelling at fellow staff. Great coffee. Cant ask for more before catching a train.
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-02-14,3,"while waiting for my buddy whos doing the amtrak journey from d.c to penn station i decided to waste some time at the nearby starbucks near the waiting area and from the crowds inside i aint the only one but at least i am purchasing a cappy and muffin while others dont buy a damn thing . its fairly spacious inside with plenty of seating but who really wants to hang out at starbucks in penn station unless your waiting for a train or waiting for someone arriving at penn station . they have the full drink and munch items you can find at any starbucks and the folks who work here are ok and keep the place clean from what i can see . the review is over , my buddy has just arrived ."
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-01-15,3,"Another Starbucks where you can buy a cup of coffee in all kinds of flavors before you run off to the job. 

This Starbucks is fairly large and has plenty of room to sit and enjoy your beverage while reading  your emails or texts."
52,starbucks-new-york-573,2019-01-10,3,"Just okay- it's the standard.

- Menu: They have pretty much the same items as any other Starbucks.

- Service: I came in around 6pm on a weekday, and there weren't many people in line; therefore, service was also pretty fast. But, I did see a decent amount of people waiting for their orders during morning rush hour before work.

- Ordering/Payment: They take the app! You can order from two sides (General Penn Station open area & Amtrak waiting area).

- Other: This location just recently opened. There aren't any seats because it's a simple stand within NYP. If you want some seating, go to the Starbucks downstairs, or find a seat in the Amtrak and NJT waiting areas."
53,joes-coffee-new-york,2019-03-03,4,"I really like Joes always tasty bake goods and hot yummy coffee. I'd highly recommend Joe's best simple black coffee in town. Nice place, nice atmosphere to meet up with your friends, clubs, book clubs .."
53,joes-coffee-new-york,2019-02-17,1,Horrible shop no plugs no WiFi. Bad attitudes and overly priced coffee. What a waste of time. I wish I picked somewhere else to go on my lunch break
53,joes-coffee-new-york,2018-08-17,5,Probably my favorite coffee in the city. The regular and iced coffee are good and their expresso drinks are fancy and excellent. The staff is friendly and efficient.
53,joes-coffee-new-york,2015-05-16,3,"Joe's Coffee cart is the neighborhood coffee cart by my office in NoMad (hate, hate, hate the term NoMad, sounds so yuppie!). They brew a solid cup of $1.00 coffee and an even better Iced Coffee (for for the $2.00 large, you won't regret it!) that goes nicely with one of their yummy looking morning pastries or a breakfast sandwich.

This cart is still packing a punch with the lunch crowd as they switch on over to halal food and street meat. Unless the grill is off at 1pm as has happened to me on 2 different weekdays now...so perhaps the street meat part has a, not clearly defined, schedule. I dropped a Yelp star off for this. Derp, derp, derp.

All I've ordered from here has been their regular coffee, their iced coffee, 1 egg and cheese sandwich on a roll and a singular roll with butter. All of these things were executed with with grace, finesse and were cheapsies. Thanks Joe!"
53,joes-coffee-new-york,2014-03-26,4,"So this food truck has been here for some time now. I don't always come here but whenever I do it's almost reuniting with an old friend. These guys are super friendly and jovial, and this is really the only reason they get 4 stars. The food is the same as the average halal food truck, although they will toast your bagels (not all of them do that). When you taste the food here you won't be amazed, but the reason to come back is that you get excellent service with a smile. I guess I prefer giving my money to happy people who actually remember you and your usual order."
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2020-01-24,3,It's just so dirty in here. The guy picked up my donut with the paper but stuck his thumb in it. Yuck.
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2019-07-04,1,"I go to this DD because it's the closest to my apt.  But after today...never again.  Now the ""BEST Duncan Donuts"" in Chelsea, is 31st between 8th & 9th Avenues.  The one on 25 and 9th failed to give me what I ordered.  3 large hot Lattes, no sugar...no foam.  What I got was 3 large lattes but 1/2 the cup was foam! I'm paying for it, so I should get what I ask for!

So now I'll walk out of my way to get my Lattes now.  Thanks, for nothing lady"
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2019-04-10,1,"This used to go to this DD location very often and never had a week to have any trouble. However this morning I stopped by and got myself a latte and a croissant toasted with butter. The drink order was wrong already, they ask if I wanted wipe cream and i respond yes, when my drink came out there wasn't any. So I just left it at that since it's no big deal. I trust the employee to give me the right order, however when when the croissant wasn't even toasted it was just heated up and there wasn't even butter on it or on the side. The croissant aren't fresh. Even the deli or 7/11 croissant are better than the one I've received."
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2017-12-29,1,Went in to buy a smoothie and was denied because he didn't feel like it mind you it was around 8 and that location is open to 11. Let's not even mention how rude he was because apparently I was a disturbance to him as a paying customer.
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2017-08-15,3,"Nothing special, but not bad either. You get what you need when you need it. Order on the go via the app some of the time."
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2017-03-09,4,This is probably my favorite dunkins..i work nearby...its close and convenient...the gal knows my coffee and makes it to perfection...thanks for making my morning amazing...
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2017-01-21,1,"Just saw the cashier scratch his back under the shirt with their cleaning brush. 

He tried to play it off as nothing  but now I know why they are hiding their b rating."
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2016-10-19,1,"Coffee and donuts taste old. I'm sure a lot of people probably get food poisoning here. They keep cleaning supplies and mop buckets next to food and drinks, they also have donuts sitting over the garbage. I home the Dept of health sees this and the picture I've attached."
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2015-05-31,4,"This is exactly what you'd expect from a dunkin donuts. Fresh donuts, quick and pleasant service, and a clean but small place. Come in, get your stuff, and get on your way. It also helps when they have the midday latte special."
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2014-03-21,4,"I've got a soft spot for the people that work here as they cop a lot of bad behaviour from homeless and the local projects.
It's small but has the basics covered. Service is always pleasant. I think their coffee is often tastier than the more expensive options nearby.
They also sell K-Cups for home and ready ground coffee.
There is a ATM machine in store as well."
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2013-10-16,2,"This section of Chelsea is weird.  It's partly expensive, filled with nice restaurants and bars.  Then you cross the street and it's government housing with some shady characters skulking about.  In the daytime it's not a big deal, but at night the less desirable elements make their presence known - even at Dunkin' Donuts.

I stopped by this DD to get a cup of coffee before a late night drive.  Service was good, all seemed quiet as I sat down and had a few sips of coffee.  I looked up and found some dude who seemed drunk, literally swaying side to side come in.  He stood on line as the guy in front of him was having his order taken.  Then at some point (I looked away for a moment) he grabbed a couple bags of coffee he had no intention of paying for and put them in his bag.  The guy who had been restocking chased him and they had a loud confrontation outside.  The clerk recovered the coffee and the guy took off.

So...not the most positive experience, but it's the nature of the area.  But hey, at least the coffee was good!"
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2013-01-06,2,"Ugh seriously, I do not need that nasty attitude early in the morning! The employees in this DD location need some proper training and customer service adjustments. C'mon crack a smile on that face, it's a sunny day!! Sheeshh!!

I already feel generous giving them two stars -- first for the consistency of the coffee (but they really can't screw up on a medium black), and second for the close proximity to my home and being on the way to my train station. In other words, this DD does not have a legitimate reason based on their food/service to earn my stars..."
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2011-07-04,3,"I''ve gotten coffee here a few times.  Staff is friendly, but it starts to get creepy when the older gentlemen remains eye contact for a little bit too long...know what I mean?

While the place has an A, I believe it's the yellow tinged lighting that gives the place a bit of a dirty feel.  That and the fact that Grand Schezuan is right there and I know they have less than an A!"
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2011-03-04,2,"It would be better if the mice didn't come out and greet the customers.
One of em tried to ""get AT me"" son...
That is all."
54,dunkin-new-york-97,2010-09-26,3,I stopped here today and ordered an ice coffee for myself and a coffee coolatta for the bf. Service was quick and the lady at the register was accommodating. I asked for the milk on the side and she poured it in a small espresso cup. They didn't have any spoons which was weird!
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2020-01-30,4,"when i make my starbucks run during the morning rush or after lunch coffee break i always order a moca ice drink regardless if its summer or winter or fall and today its no different . typical buckys setup and the typical crowded space with folks overstaying while soaking up the free wifi and charging . so far no mistakes whenever i order at this location and staff are always friendly and move around fast getting your hot and cold beverages to you in a reasonable manner. still like the lemon frosted pound cake the most when ordering sweets . time to leave as the tony bennett song is putting me to sleep. on 34th St and 5th Ave and the order , pay and pickup setup is the system every Starbucks should follow ."
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2019-09-25,4,The waiting and the line area was a bit confusing . The staffs were really friendly and welcoming. Great smiles. Coffee is nice and strong. Perfect for the morning to wake me up.
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2018-11-29,5,"LESHAY is all I have to say!! I've been at this location twice and both times this barista has made my holidays a little brighter. 

Keep that incredible spirit you have girl, it shines bright. 

:: 

This is the type of pop- in Starbucks, you wouldn't sit down and read a book here (no seating) but the service is great and I've never been dissatisfied with my drinks here."
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2018-08-09,1,Morning rush is a disaster. There is no order to anything they do here. Chaos and poor customer service. Avoid going there if possible.
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2018-04-07,1,Omg moldy egg bites I couldn't even imagine eating this is insane who serves this?! It is sooooo gross!!
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2018-04-01,5,"Small but friendly store that is closed on weekends. I strongly prefer this store to the main ESB location at the corner of 34th and 7th. The staff was extremely courteous and efficient.

With this being a Starbucks Express store, they do not stock all flavors of syrups, such as the raspberry that I usually add to my Caffe Mocha. However, they did have cherry syrup left over from the Starbucks Valentine's Day promotion and it tasted great in my Mocha!

This store does not have seating, but they did let me sit by the window sill to use the wi-fi and power outlet for a few minutes."
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2018-03-22,1,"I will never walk into this Starbucks again! I will be writing a formal letter of complaint to the head office. Never have I been mistreated as a Customer. The only saving grace is that I got my money back, but the manager was extremely incompetent."
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2017-09-15,1,This is genuinely the worst Starbucks I have ever been to and I have given it multiple chances. The drinks are almost always wrong. And I end up waiting for 25 minutes just to eventually have the staff ask me what I had ordered. It has happened at least 8 times to me and I've seen it happen to others while I am there. They are unorganized. And people get so tired of waiting for their drinks that they end up taking any others that are put down and unclaimed. They could potentially solve that issue just by writing the persons name on the cup like all of the other Starbucks do.
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2017-08-24,1,"I walked in, two people working, no one even acknowledged my presence.  One drink being made, at least say hi, tell me it will be a bit...no?  Okay.  Standing around waiting, still nothing.  I'm out, there's another two blocks away."
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2017-05-05,3,"The green tea latte was good, but customer service was alright, not the best, and not the worst. I ask myself why I even continue going to starbucks when there are other local coffee shops around that need support."
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2016-12-21,2,Not sugar free mocha and they don't make fraps here! Very disappointing. Only reason they get a two is because the cashier/barista was nice.
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2016-09-15,2,"Situation: Dropped by this location because it was conveniently en route to work. Was unpleasantly surprised to discover that they weren't able to make a green tea latte like any of the other Starbucks locations because they operated on a limited menu. It was made so much worse simply because the cashier who told me this news was extremely rude and standoffish about it.

PROS
-It's a smaller location, no seating or anything, so the queue tends to be shorter and less of a wait. 

CONS
-The limited menu. This fact should definitely be more prominently displayed so that customers don't have to waste time going in, being rudely told that they can't make their drink, and then leaving in a bad mood.
-Poor service. For an ""express"" location, they have an awful lot of people, who don't seem particularly friendly. Perhaps because they're all crammed into that tiny space. 

In a nutshell...
Only go to this location if you're desperate. The service overall has been horrendous, a general trend that I've been noticing at several Starbucks recently e.g. rude service, sluggish, employees are too busy socialising, etc. Perhaps the corporation believes that they are so popular and widespread that they can afford to offer poor service and lose customers, so they have not enforced high standards, but over time, I think they will find they are mistaken. With the rise of other formidable coffee alternatives such as Dunkin' and rising independent coffee shops, Starbucks better shape up or watch out. Customers can change their preferences almost overnight: in the words of Heidi Klum, ""One day you're in, the next day you're out""."
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2016-08-12,1,This starbucks location is never busy ywt they take good long amount of time to get your stuff ready.. And when they ask to repeat the order they pretend they don't understand what i m saying. So next time i will write a better review if i get better service. Its just ready made coffee and pastry how hard is it
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2016-07-27,2,"The employees at this Starbucks are lazy. Two examples:

--Ordered a venti cold brew with coconut milk. First employee mistakenly made it in a grande cup and when the second employee noticed the mistake, she poured it into a venti cup and instead of adding more coffee, (coffee that costs $4 by the way) she added more ice and coconut milk and handed it to me.
--Every time I order I specify iced coffee with coconut milk and every time they forget to add it and I have to ask for it at the bar, and the employee acts like it's a hassle.

Sorry for wanting my order right when I'm paying almost $5 for your coffee...?

Bottom line this is an efficient location because of the host at the front of the store but at this point I'll be taking my business somewhere else where I'll get what I'm paying for."
55,starbucks-new-york-459,2016-02-22,4,"this is the most efficient Sb I have been to so far. They have a host right by the door to take your order right away when u r in. So your order really comes faster than the other regular stores. If u r not far from this Sb and buy coffee at peak time everyday like I do, go there!"

The restroom needed some love but it's to be expected in NYC. 

However I loved their meeting room option! In this location I would have never expected to see a meeting area that was closed off by glass doors! How completely amazing! Every Starbucks should have one!!! 

Great job Starbucks!"
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2019-06-19,1,"First off we are in rare Starbucks dead zone at Hudson Yards where we don't have the usual choice of a Starbucks on every corner, this is the only one nearby.  I've been going here for 5 weeks and wanted to reserve my judgement hoping things would approve but alas that has not been the case.  Half the time they don't have my mobile order as their system seems to always be having problems.  The staff is very friendly but seems to be lacking some leadership/oversight.  Today the bins were overflowing with trash and the area where you fix your drink looked like a hurricane hit it with spilled coffee, wet napkins and sugar all over.  Meanwhile there were 5 employees standing around behind the counter and very few customers.  Someone needs to run things better here as it's a large and new Starbucks but seriously lacking in the service and quality you expect from Starbucks.  I hope things get better as I have no choice but to use this one until more open in the area.  Another visit today and another mobile order screwed up- sandwich waiting but not my coffee- they need to get their shit together ASAP!!!"
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2019-05-02,1,"Extremely slow! I ordered my coffee on the app multiple times from 10-40 min before I've picked it up and it's never ready. Today I ordered my coffee (black coffee) while I was on my way to work, 30 minutes before I arrived at the store. Had to then wait another 15 minutes. Not worth the horrible wait for sub par coffee. Many better places across the street in Hudson yards."
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2019-04-03,1,Be prepared to order 20 min ahead and still ask where your order is twice. There are multiple cashiers and baristas standing around not doing much while there is a big crowd of frustrated customers waiting for their order.
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2019-03-06,1,"I am here a lot as I work in the area and finally has to write a review because it's so consistently and unbelievably slow. Despite 8 people behind the counter this morning, they forgot four people's drip coffees (including mine) because the person at the register couldn't be bothers to fill them herself. It's the easiest thing at Starbucks! Another time they served me a hot tea but the water was lukewarm. I got attitude when I asked for hot water. And that's just two recent occasions. ... Please do better."
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2019-02-26,1,"This Starbucks location started off OK, with time it just got worst. Do not go in the morning if you don't have 25 minutes to spare because the wait is ridiculous. And  if you complain the staff gives you an attitude and tells you there's nothing they can do. 
Today I ordered my coffee at 8:44am and did not get it until 9:15am, I was late to my meeting and then realized they had handed me the wrong coffee. When I went back to get the right one, they were extremely rude and made me wait AGAIN for the right coffee. I can't go back to that hot mess store. Management and staff needs to be retrained!"
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2019-02-22,1,"Service is the WORST. You can wait a good 10 minutes on line, then another 15 between ordering and getting your order. Because of this, everyone does mobile orders now (which they encourage), but you have to be strategic because you can expect to wait at least half an hour from the time you place it -- and even then, half the time they get it wrong or forget something, which then takes another 15. Seems like they have different workers every week, which I have to assume is because people quit after a few days of having to deal with non-stop complaints and angry customers all day. They stay in business because of their location -- it's in a high-population office building and it's the only decent coffee anywhere nearby -- and that's the only reason you'd ever want to come here."
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2019-01-17,2,"The employees are nice and they seem to try to get things out, but they are overwhelmed. I have not been back in some time. I gave it a shot this morning and was disappointed yet again. They were nice enough to give me a gift card while I waited and waited. Even after the gift card, I had to wait some more. The frustrating part is having everyone else get their order (the same item I ordered) time and time again while I am told my order is on its way. I gave up and requested a refund. I at least received my drink right away. I will go back to getting breakfast from the coffee trucks."
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2018-11-08,1,Mobile orders are never on time. I've waited up to 25 min for an order. To cancel you have to wait in line which is always long!
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2018-10-26,1,"This Starbucks is just horrible. This is the third time they've ""lost"" my mobile order. And when you ask them the status they look around but don't say anything and you end up waiting longer. Literally the s**ttiest service you could think of. And when they do actually get your order right you still end up having to wait for your drinks. Horrible horrible horrible customer service."
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2018-10-26,2,"Looks like they have completely fallen again on service and it's very frustrating. It's hilarious they have a sign saying order ahead and don't be late but yet that makes no difference!

This location doesn't get any tourists so there is no excuse why they are so extremely slow and forgetful here. Maybe they need a new set of employees, since every morning waiting extra ten minutes here for coffee and food to be warmed up. 

That's twenty minutes for incompetence at this location. It's very frustrating since you do a mobile order way ahead of time only to wait the same time in the store"
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2018-10-04,5,"This location is in the lobby of an office building. It has a good amount of space for seating and is generally clean. I was able to do some work here for about 1-2 hrs. The bathrooms are relatively clean as well. 
The only issue was my mobile orders were not there and I had to ask for my orders. The staff was quick to get my order ready asap so it wasn't much of a problem."

What sets this place apart is the staff. They are probably in the top 1% of the baristas I've ever dealt with. They are nice, cordial, and are known to remedy any mistake with a smile and an adjustment to your order."
56,starbucks-new-york-540,2013-10-13,2,"Drinks were up to par, service was good, but the bathroom was one of the most disgusting I have EVER seen. Needs a serious renovation to bring it up to even a moderate standard."

57,dunkin-new-york-170,2017-09-14,1,I use this DD to get coffee for work quite often but I am going to avoid it for something other than the coffee.  There is frequently a young man standing at the front door opening it expecting a handout.  I don't want anyone opening a door for me expecting anything.  I asked him not to and this started a stream of racist epithets from this young man calling me white trash and this week he told me to say good morning to the KKK!  This kid is a racist punk and I am done with this DD.  There's a million of them in Chelsea that I don't need to put up with this abuse.  I hope the management of this particular DD reads this review because I have spent hundreds of dollars here but that's over.  They should police what is going on at this location better than they are.
57,dunkin-new-york-170,2017-08-10,4,"I come here a few times a week on my break. Staff is pleasant, they know how to make your coffee and it is relatively clean for a DD. Room for improvement would be to not let ppl sit here all day- you have a sign on the wall saying you have a 20min per customer so time but don't enforce it some ppl don't even buy anything and take up an entire table. Also the food could be cooked slightly quicker."
57,dunkin-new-york-170,2017-02-23,1,"Horrible place! They are always short in staff, never have any napkins, super dirty floors and tables coffee spilled everywhere! 

Management do something."
57,dunkin-new-york-170,2016-05-06,3,"Weird - I thought this would be a better Dunkin Donuts than the other one nearby. It didn't even feel like a regular American DD because the music that was being played sounded Arabic. I thought that was interesting and different. Anyways, the iced coffee I ordered had a bitter aftertaste, kinda like 'yuck'. Not sure why it was so different... maybe just a bad batch.
Also, when ordering make sure to describe exactly how you want your drink or food because the crew will otherwise ask you just to make sure you'll get what you want."
57,dunkin-new-york-170,2015-09-25,4,My local DD from work. Haven't yet disliked anything I have tried. My husband and I are in love with their caramel latte ( beware you will gain weight if you have it everyday tip from me gained 20 pounds from having it everyday). Love the wake up wraps. Staff are amazing currently they have changed the staff but getting to know the new staff. Cleanliness not bad but need some help reason for the lost stars. Service is good speed ok it is a busy store
57,dunkin-new-york-170,2015-06-14,4,Very good coffee. It was very fresh. Definitely will be coming back here for breakfast and more coffee.
57,dunkin-new-york-170,2015-03-18,5,"This is the best Dunkin' Donuts in all of Manhattan (that I've sampled). The layout is small but orderly (one line for two registers and a lone order pick-up area). The employees are friendly and will make up for any mistakes they may make (I've been charged for two coffees before then given a ""free"" one during my next visit). The older gentleman usually working the food orders in the back is top notch and very, very quick. And the manager is a Devils fan which is rare in the city. All around a great place to grab a coffee and breakfast in the morning."
57,dunkin-new-york-170,2013-01-11,1,"I wasn't going to do this...but some senseless female employee got on my last nerve.

Senseless female employee: How may I help you?
Me: Can I get a large decaf coffee?
SFE: Milk and sugar?
Me: ...uh, the regular kind. 
SFE: $3.15.
Me: This is decaf, right?
SFE: You are asking for decaf?

This fool just pours the ""regular coffee"" she thought I asked for, and pours the decaf into the same cup. Whatever...I'm hoping my boss wouldn't mind a little sugar in her coffee.

I bring back the coffee to work and a few minutes later, my boss spits the coffee out and says she doesn't drink anything with sugar in it. I told her I'll go back and yell at the woman who charged me.

I go back and it's a male employee.

Me: Hi, I just ordered this decaf coffee from her (pointing to the SFE)...and...
SFE: YOU ASKED FOR MILK AND SUGAR.
Me: I didn't ASK for milk and sugar. I asked for a decaf coffee, but for some reason, you thought milk and sugar went inside a decaf.
SFE: You said the regular.
Me: I meant how people regularly order a decaf...without milk and sugar, obviously. I just want a decaf coffee...with nothing in it. Can I please get that?
 
After being offered sugar AGAIN (really tho?), I finally got them to just close the top and hand me my decaf. Holy balls."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2019-03-25,2,"Horrible customer service at this Nespresso location. I usually get my capsule refills at the Bloomie's or at the Soho boutiques (both with exceptional customer service) but I was shopping at Macy's and happened to see new flavors being advertised, so I asked a sales associate if I could try the Costa Rica flavor. He replied that it's $20 a sleeve and asked if I'm SURE I want to try it. I'm not even sure what that means. I usually try new flavors before I buy them and never had a problem getting samples before. But he made it sound like I'm a cheapo who just wanted free samples and didnt have $20. In the end, I didn't get to try any coffee but I did buy other flavors I'm familiar with since I am running low on them. When my transaction went through, the sales asked me to put my sleeves in my handbag instead of giving me a bag. He must be the cheapest salesperson ever.  First he didn't want to let me try the new flavors they're advertising because ""it's $20 a sleeve"". Next, he didn't want to give me a bag. I have never encountered this type of behavior from Nespresso before. I know I am definitely staying away from this Macy's location."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2019-02-10,1,"This Nespresso boutique has pretty much all the coffee/ espresso pods and deals as you would get online as well as the online promotion.

Customer service here sucks... if you are inquiring about coffee or want to do a coffee tasting, you have to wait 30 minutes for someone to help you... and the lady who told me to wait didn't even acknowledge me after that as she was just chit chatting with someone else... which BTW didn't even buy anything. I just wanted to try a particular brand of expresso before buying it.

Don't waste your time here and just order online. Save yourself from the rudeness"
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2018-11-09,5,"I had the best experience I've ever had at nespresso TODAY.
Greeted by Brandon and served coffee by him as well. Informed, and professional, and just started only 2 months ago! He was delightful. He needs to head out to the Madison or soho stores, ASAP 
Scott is the manager at this location, I can see how Brandon is so good at his job, Scott is a pro as well. Charming and as kind as Brandon.They also introduced me to the new Paris line, yummy and strong.
I know it's just coffee, but every wonderful retail experience counts, and it makes my day better. Tky Brandon and Scott."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2018-09-12,1,Im a regular in nespresso! Have a machine. But i hate their new policy. They are no longer honoring their promise of complimentary coffee when ever you visit their boutique. It is now only with a purchase. Or if you listen to their presentation. It use to be whenever you visit the store. Its a shame cuz the actual team is really good. But will have to reconsider how i buy coffee.
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2018-09-05,1,"Honestly I don't understand why are the rating so high at this location, or maybe it's just the nightclub bouncer look-like sale who thinks he's on his night shift both times I visited. I wonder if he likes to take some time to grieve at work, despises customers who don't learn the names for every coffee on the shelve, or it's just nespresso explicitly told him to never smile to the customers. 
But why would the company cares about what one customer says right?"
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2018-04-27,5,"I love this nespresso shop. I always get the best service and they always have everything! I received the best service in the world today from Daniel, everyone else is great too!!!!!"
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2017-12-15,4,"If you're a fan of Nespresso and don't feel like waiting for the shipment of your pods to arrive. Definitely, ​stop by this Macy's and do a little shopping at this Nespresso Boutique on the 8th floor. The staff here are very helpful and recommend capsules that best fit your everyday coffee needs. They also brew some of the capsules on the spot for you to try, which is a nice touch. Instead of ​ committing to 10-40 pods you can try them before you buy. 

The first purchase of your Nespresso​ machine comes with a $10 off coupon for your first Nespresso capsule purchase online. Which is a nice incentive. 

Happy brewing!"
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2017-08-28,5,My husband and I went to Barcelona and he fell in love with the Nespresso machine and coffee.   For his birthday I purchased a machine.   I realized that i didn't have a nespresso boutique near me.  So while in NY I stopped over to the Macy's Nespresso Boutique.   This was my first buy and I was so impressed by the service and the lovely set up.   The manager and a new trainee walked me through the Nespresso line and gave me such wonderful recommendations.   Everyone was helpful and friendly.    My transaction went very smoothly.   Nespresso you have a customer for life... well for the life of my Nespresso machine!!   Not to mention I'll be back shopping at the Macy's location very soon!   Kudos to the wonderful customer service folks.  I don't recall the name of the trainee but the manager Larry was super awesome and understanding of my newness to the brand.  Ankit and Kathleen were very friendly And welcoming!   Once again a great team and super awesome customer service.  Thank you !!
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2017-06-26,5,If you love Nespresso this is a great place to sample a few new flavors or to purchase pods for your home machine. Great friendly service and lots of Nespresso to choose from.
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2017-03-29,5,"I love Nespresso and think the crew at Macy's is great.  I needed some coffee and went in on a day in mid March when almost everything was closed due to a snow storm.  I happened to be working that day and Macy's is close.  I usually see Clinton, but Kathleen was the only one in that day.  Kathleen was kind and friendly and professional in taking care of me.  Great little shop in the normal chaos of Macy's."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2017-03-11,4,"The location is a pain obviously. 
It's on the 8th floor of the Herald Square Macy's. It's a maze. 

The Nespresso staff was one of the most pleasant in-store as a whole. Welcoming and helpful. They seem to enjoy their jobs and are happy to make recommendations. The staff was sincerely great unlike the staff at the Soho location. They were professional and happy to help. 

I was happy to find that the Selection Vintage 2014 is still well stocked here since it's sold out online. I even took the time to buy some capsules for my boss and got to try flavors that are only available for the Original Line. Great job."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2017-02-25,5,"young kriss the most helpful energetic enthusiastic, great patience, knows and loves his product so well!!! i'm sorry that i only needed one machine 'cause he could have sold me them all - a genuinely lovely oasis, amidst a sea of turmoil, to shop

visiting two months later and kriss there as exhuberant, knowledgeable and pleasant as he was in december - his colleagues are all charming as well - check them out!!!"
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2017-02-21,5,"Am an 83 years old Prof who loves NYC's fun places. Among my favorite is 34th street MACY's Nespresso Boutique on the 8th Floor. Members of the staff, especially Christopher, are extremely pleasant, graceful, and ""go beyond the call of duty,"" with much compassion to assist the visitor -it is a home away from home- please visit it and get the best of all possible coffees and the very best of the Big Apple!"
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2017-01-15,5,"We visited the Nespresso boutique on the 8th floor of the Macy's building.  The shop had a few elegant display stands of their Virtuoline and original coffee makers and a wall full of capsule sleeves, but what impressed us the most was their free coffee and espresso sample booth!  I'd definitely come back, even if it's just for a free Nespresso coffee!"
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-12-29,5,"Clinton was absolutely hands down the best sales associate here! We made great conversation and he was more than knowledgeable about the products! A Nespresso expert does not even do him justice! Thank you for the help today Clinton! And if you ever find yourself in Atlanta, let us know!"
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-12-22,1,"I was shopping in Macy's for Christmas gifts on 12/21/16. I like the idea that customers can try products before their purchases.  However, the sales reps at the counter were rude.  The counter was quiet on a weekday.  A sales rep told me that I cannot try any coffee samples unless I'm their club member (which means I already own a coffee machine) or I consider buying their coffee makers that day. Their sales reps have an attitude and judge people in their own way (""hey no free samples!!""). I feel that I was being discriminated. There are many coffee machine brands in the market, why I would consider one company with bad attitude and bad customer services?!"
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-12-07,5,I can not say enough about how wonderful this  shopping experience was. I want to single out Hector for customer service above and beyond the call of duty. He was attentive and focused on helping us figure out exactly what is right for us and getting us the best deal possible! If I could give ten stars I would. Highly recommend!!!
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-11-05,5,They are the nicest people that work here. They are very helpful and very knowledgeable about the different nuances of each particular coffee. I'm here at least 3 times a week buying coffee for my machine. This is really the only place I go to to buy the Nespresso pods.
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-06-03,5,"So I have got to give it up to nespresso 34st coffee girl Sanefia, she was amazing. I stopped by today to purchase coffee and see what's new. When I got to nespresso I saw one sales rep Sanefia one the floor alone with 5 people at the bar waiting for coffee and 6 people on the line waiting to be ring up including me, with Macys music so loud I cant hear myself think. Its frecking zoo. I felt so bad for her. There was no one I mean no one on the floor but this poor girl. She was running from the bar to make coffee and back to the cash-strap back and forth until she got to me, she sincerely apologize for my 15 minute wait. I told her I completely understand I see that you're the only one here. I really wanted to help this girl. Where is the rest of the people ? where are the manager? Why is Nespresso having this girl on the floor by herself? And why is Macy's having a party i can't hear myself, I felt like I was shouting my order so loud. It was ridiculous. This girl customer service is beyond words, from a scale 1 to 10 I'm giving her a full 20."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-05-17,4,"I visited the Nespresso store and was ""greeted"" by a girl named Stefana or Stephanie, couldn't quite catch the name. It wasn't much of a greeting due to the fact that she was EXTREMELY rude. I wasn't sure if this is the kind of business Nespresso is running until she rolled her eyes and handed me off to another gentleman I believed was named Hector. He assured me with his service and kindness that the woman was just intentionally being rude. The only reason this is receiving a 4 is due to his recovery of the conversation as well giving me all the information needed in my future purchase of this machine."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-04-19,5,"I became a Nespresso fan a couple of years ago and decided to invest. Mr. C* (best rep ever) walked me through the process and I selected the vertuoline (because I love coffee and my husband loves expresso). That was two years ago and Mr. C has been my guy ever since. Such a pleasure to work with and extremely knowledgeable of the products and product line. I brought my husband in for the first time yesterday and Mr. C remembered everything I'd told him about my husband's expresso preferences. I would battle the Macys crowd any day to work with him. Even when he's not around, I still get the Nespresso treatment. Plus, from the basement to the top floor - I love the new setup. 

* I didn't use Mr. C's real name because I didn't get permission to put him on blasts. Great guy."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-04-11,5,"I travel to NYC often and, if in need of capsules, will stop in at the nearest boutique to grab some. My partner and I were here this weekend and it was a great experience overall. Clinton at the Nespresso counter was delightful. He was friendly and informative. We would go back to this location over the flagship Madison Ave location any day. Go and ask for Clinton - he'll take care of you.

The only drawback to shopping there this weekend was that Macy's was having some food event and the music was uncomfortably loud."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-03-28,5,I have been here several times and have always been helped with a smile. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly and always offer me samples.
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-03-23,4,I'm new to Nespresso and I have made my last two purchases at this location since it's right next to my office. Both times I was in and out in 5 mins.  The sales associates came right up to me and asked me if I needed help. Since I wasn't sure what I wanted they offered me samples. Their suggestions were great. I will continue to purchase from here.
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-03-22,1,"Nespresso at macys is bad for business and it's  staff are disillusioned  with to much attitude for shop servants.. the clerks are a disgrace to the macys Brand.Very rude clueless  . next time i go to this store and a nespresso staff  associate  is rude there gonna get a vertuoline machine  smashed over there head!


Macy's  should be trained by   Bloomingdale's  staff  that  sets the bar for  excellence 
in customer service..... they also save me the headache  and time from smashing a  nespresso  machine of the head of the next rude  coffee clerk that gives me attitude"
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-03-12,2,"I must agree customer service here is terrible. I come to this location bc it's the closest to where I live.  I usually buy my coffee in bulk so I've only had to come here three times but all 3 times I was barely greeted. 

The first time the sales associate looked at me like I was crazy for selecting 10 different flavors and was generally unfriendly. Also others were being offered samples and I was not. 

The second time I came to the counter and 3 people standing behind it just stared at me. I asked one of them to replicate my last order and again it was as if I was speaking a different language. Again others being offered samples and I was not. 

Third time the person helping me was slightly more friendly and she did offer a sample. As I was waiting for her to ring me up I started looking around and just observing new coffees and such. One of the other sales associates came over and asked her if everything was ok and he gave me a weird look and lowered his voice and said something to her. She said no everything was fine. Bc it was. Strange, awkward and slightly rude if you ask me. How about minding your damn business and focus on adjusting the attitude of your other sales staff instead of worrying about me. 

I think for the price of this product the service at this location is beyond sub par. I don't know that I will continue to come here. Might just try going to the boutique locations or bloomies. The reviews on yelp seem to indicate a much more pleasant experience."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2016-01-27,5,Some sharp people working here. Elias was a wizard at explaining my machine to me and painting a very clear picture about the different coffees and having me understand the different coffee types. Came in for a first time in store coffee purchase and left very confident in the product and coffee knowledge. Highly recommend.
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2015-12-29,5,"I had a great experience at the Nespresso at Macy's on 34th street yesterday. The salesman Christopher was extremely helpful. I was just about to leave when he figured out that I spent enough to get a free gift. He went back in and redid the receipt, and I left with a de-scaler and an extra sleeve of my favorite flavor. He went out of his way. It was a nice touch. I keep going back to that store, because I find that the sales staff is attentive and friendly."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2015-12-26,5,Awesome service. Staff is always showing us their newest products and are willing to help us learn about our mashing. 8th floor... Don't leave without visiting.
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2015-12-15,3,"They moved to 8th floor due to renovation. 

I found out that they do not carry full selection compared to Soho location or Madison Ave Location. It means they still have all coffee selection, but they don't have some accessories, chocolates, and etc..

Avg. customer service."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2015-10-01,1,I've never had such terrible customer service. The 3 girls working there were fighting with each other while we waited and waited to be helped ... There was no one else there. They were also very rude to us. They also were out of quite a few different pods and never once offered us samples. Go to the soho location.
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2015-04-27,4,"BE CAREFUL, DUE TO RENOVATION AT MACY'S, Store moved to 7 floor.

Good service everytime I go, pretty busy as usual, but not as much as the one in Soho.
I loved the place when it was downstairs and easy to access. The new location made it longer to access."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2015-03-23,5,"I have to disagree with the other yelpers on this one. I go here once a month or so and every time I go I am treated like gold. Everything is always in stock, I'm always offered a free coffee, staff is super polite and they are, well, elegant is the first word that comes to mind."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2015-03-21,1,"I've been to this one a few times, not a big fan. The workers are not that nice, and they're stingy with the samples which is disappointing, considering that I like to try new flavors and buy in bulk. The one in soho is so much better, super friendly and they aren't stingy with samples."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2014-12-12,2,"One star because they are disorganized. There were 4 sales reps, but only one person at the register. I waited 15+ minutes and I was still not getting my capsules so I left the store. The store in Soho is much better I'm giving 2 stars because they serve free coffee samples. I will not go back."
58,nespresso-boutique-at-macys-new-york,2014-06-20,5,"Just discovered a new branch of Nespresso inside of Macy's at Herald Sq.
It's in basement level near escalator, it has nice sized section of Nespresso.
The staffs were very nice and informational, and asked to try some new selection of coffee.
Of course, Nespresso has good coffee selections among espresso brands.

When you need coffee break while you shop around, this is the spot you need to stop by. Free trial does not hurt you."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2019-08-30,1,"I don't know what's up with this Starbucks but even with a mobile order (placed 15 mins before I arrived), I still have to wait 20-30 mins for my drink to be ready. 

Also, it is very inconvenient for the staff to move the straws to the bar area. I don't know why customers have to navigate thru 10-15 non-caffeinated grumpy people to get a straw."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2019-04-23,4,i usually dont do starbucks after work but as i was walking to grand central terminal the strange craving for a mocha frappe was to strong not to enter this buckys on madison and 42nd st . damn its crowded and place is not spacious with limited seating but i am doing take out so its not a problem . the usually starbucks brand crammed inside with the typical offerings but its just a beverage i want and thats what the girl handed me after removing almost 7 bucks from my wallet. the simple rule to follow when getting something to munch on at starbucks is early morning is the best time as its at its freshest especially the pastries . before leaving i used some of the free wifi for a bit and so was everyone else . a sweet cold drink while i make my way to white plains and if history repeats itself my tummy will rumble like a jungle in a few hours .
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2019-03-26,3,Small but ok to pick up and go. Less crowded at rush hour than other Starbucks in midtown. Friendly workers. Not sure why the low rating. Very courteous people working there. Upbeat- music just loud for the size but not crazy loud.
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2019-01-05,4,"No wait, friendly staff. Could be cleaner as there was just garbage sitting on the hi-top tables, and employees were walking past several times and the garbage was never cleared, even up until I left."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2018-07-17,1,"I have a business account near this location and stopped in this morning around 10:20 am to pick up some items. It was clear that I was an inconvenience to the woman behind the register who continued to have a conversation with the baristas, laughing out loud, looking backwards and eating a banana all while I was standing at the register. I waited until she was ready for me to complete my order as I was clearly interrupting her lack of customer service. Once I placed my final order, she put in the wrong food and completely missed one of the drinks. I will never use this location again. I plan on calling corporate about it, which I never do."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2018-07-06,1,I ordered a serious strawberry drink with a banana added and the first time it had no strawberry. I asked the barista if it was missing strawberry and he said no. It was though. So he made it again and again... no strawberry!!?? Next time if I want strawberry I'll just order a coffee!
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2018-06-26,5,"It was my birthday and statbucks didn't send my free voucher. I spoke to Monica (your cashier) and she was wonderful!!! She accommodated me with a smile and joy! Josh was her right hand man, comforting me things like that happen! I tried to show proof it was my birthday but they believed me... GIVE THEM BOTH A RAISE!!!!!! Yes!!!"
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2018-06-08,1,"This is probably the worst Starbucks that I been. 
The staff here is totally rude, rolling their eyes and raise their voice when they talk to the guest. Serious. Not recommend to everyone if you are in the area. Try to get the Mac Donald cafe or something else. Sorry . I love Starbucks. But not this one."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2018-04-01,2,"While I love Starbucks, this has to be one of my least favorite locations, and I've been to Starbucks all over the world. Unfortunately, this location is right across my office so I'm always here. The staff is just so incredibly rude and they have no sense of patience or care for their customers.

In my years of visits here, I have seen employees roll their eyes at customers, raise their voices at customers, make drinks out of order, whisper to each other about other customers...just to name a few mishaps. Every time I visit, there is at least one disgruntled customer because of the lack of customer service at this Starbucks, and I don't blame them. 

To attempt to keep my contact with the employees at a minimum, I've tried mobile ordering. However, each time I've done it, I've ended up waiting just as long if not longer than if I were to stay in line. More often than not, my order is also messed up.

Even though experiences like this would normally steer me away from businesses like this, I have to put up with it since it's the closest Starbucks to my office. For such a busy Starbucks, in the heart of Midtown East and across Grand Central, this particular location really disappoints. It needs a complete overall and re-training of their employees."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2018-03-23,1,"This location is super convenient for grabbing something before work, which is the only reason i still come here. My mobile order takes nearly 20 minutes, and often times I have to ask about it before they'll even start it. Today I had to ask twice and the prove that I ordered it because he didn't believe me. Going to start going to a less convenient location."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2018-03-16,2,This location has the worst service. I often find my Mobile orders either it's not there yet after 20 mins or they mess up n turn my order to something I did not order. No apology n no sign of feeling bad for their customers. Wish I don't have to come here. May be I will walk extra blocks for someone else.
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2018-02-09,1,"I guess I'm too ""west Coast"" for NY! I walked in to this place because it was near the hotel. They had the music extremely loud! I couldn't hear anything at all! I didn't understand what the guy was saying either. It was a terrible experience."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2018-02-04,4,"Really close to grand central. Service was very efficient! I order a caramel machiatto with extra caramel and almond milk which is my standard and is beyond amazing! 

I ordered a hot Carmel macchiato by accident and they were more than willing to make it iced no problem and no questions asked. 

Small interior... so limited seating. Staff is very sweet but there's is homeless people soliciting you to buy them coffee which is annoying."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2017-11-23,2,My caramel macchiato tastes like espresso. There was a lot of people waiting for their drinks and the starbucks team was in a hurry to prepare everything on time.
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2017-11-15,3,"Small Starbucks conveniently located near Grand Central. There is a bathroom, but not a lot of seating so this is not the best place to linger. The people working here were efficient but not overly friendly."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2017-11-01,1,"Ordered 2 drinks, waited 15 minutes, 2nd drink never came.  Asked about it, barista said it would come right up.  5 minutes later, no drink.  Had to leave and go to a meeting.  Also, Starbucks used to play soothing cafe music, now they play club music and it's loud, so no one can hear anything when they call out the names.  I've been to this place 5 times now and they have messed up my order 2 times.  I don't order anything complicated, just what's on the menu.  In short, if you need a coffee or want the holiday drink, try someplace else."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2017-07-23,1,"You would think there are standards in business practices of Starbucks!  But think again.  If you want average drink but nasty attitude go to this store.  We asked for the bagels to be toasted, instead he warmed it up and by the time we left we realized he has not even split the to toast them, rather warmed them and they were soggy as hell.  Definitely not recommend this store."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2017-03-24,1,Bad service. I drink Starbucks every day and have never seen service this slow (and wrong). My drink was wrong and I ended up walking out (and leaving the coffee) after the barista started arguing with me. Sticker machine apparently broken and the cashier apparently couldn't tell him my order or write it on a cup (although she did know how to charge me for it). Don't know his name but young guy working around 5pm. $5 for nothing. Waste of 15 minutes. Horrible.
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2017-02-03,1,"By far the worst Starbucks location I have ever been to. I'm not sure why I have been more than once. I work across the street, and my co-workers talk about how terrible this location is. Today I went in, there was no line. I waited to place my order because the worker was talking to the other employees rather than waiting on the customers. Then the person making my drink literally walked away half way through to talk to the other employees. The other barista (if they deserve that title) walked away halfway through making my drink, I guess it was their break, to talk to other employees as well. All of which would be forgiven if the employees were friendly to being with."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2016-07-07,1,"Several Starbucks within a few block radius, and I had the misfortune to walk into this location. Having flown into town early that morning from Texas, I needed a caffeine boost. I was so tired that I dozed off after ordering and sitting down. My wife woke me 10 minutes later to complain that our order was still not ready, and that people who came in after us had gotten their orders. When I raised the issue, I was informed that the little sticker for my order never printed, so the barista didn't make my drink. No problem, mistakes happen. Amazingly, the staff compounded the problem by not immediately making my drink but rather continuing to make other orders. After waiting a couple more minutes with still no drink, I got fed up and requested a refund. The cashier issued the refund, offered nothing else for my lousy experience, and we left. Definitely not the usual exceptional customer service that I've come to expect from Starbucks."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2015-10-22,4,"With 5 Starbucks a hop, skip and a jump from my office (there is even one in my office) this is by far my favorite. The baristas are friendly and efficient. My go to drink: Pumpkin Spice Latte (basic!)"
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2015-10-15,2,"I needed to stay at a place with a wi-fi until 9:30 pm. All other Starbucks closed before then, so it was nice that this store remained open until 10 pm. On the downside, it's a pretty small store and I was disappointed to find so little seating area - I guess it's not really a place for working compared to other bigger Starbucks. The place was also very cold, so I hope they turn up the temperature in the future...winter is coming."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2015-08-16,3,"A Starbucks is a Starbucks. Nothing changes from one another. I had great service when I went, however they didn't have many choices for food. They were out of many things like their bagels. We found place to eat but it's not big. There's no electric outlets if you wanna work there with your computer. 
The employees were nice and helping."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2014-10-30,3,"Tiny location.  There was goofing off chit-chat in the evening when I came in so it wasn't as bad as it might be at other times.  Staff was friendly enough, no issues here though I'd prefer a larger location for my hanging out needs."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2014-08-21,5,"Love the atmosphere.  Even it's a very busy location you don't feel any fuss there. Stuff is friendly, coffee good as usual: )"
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2014-07-17,1,"The worst starbucks I've ever been to. At $6 a drink and customers coming in twice a day, you'd think they'd train their baristas to be polite and courteous, or at the very least to not be rude. The guy who took my order today completely ruined my morning with his terrible attitude and sassy tone. I will never come to this Starbucks again and I'll make sure no one else in my office does either. 

To top it all off there were SEVERAL flies in the pastry counter. A fly was on a chocolate croissant and I told another barista about it and she just shrugged it off. I can't believe a Starbucks can run like this, its absolutely appalling!"
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2014-01-19,3,"Came here in the evening. There was only one person in front of me. Coffee was as can be expected at Starbucks. The place s a bit on the smaller side for a starbucks. I am not sure how it is during rush hour, but I agree with the other reviews that the service was nice."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2013-02-20,1,"i'm extremely disappointed in the staff at this location today. my team will get what we call 'dopio time' pretty much every day, same order alternating between this starbucks and the one around the corner. 

today, we went in and someone rudely explained to us how our order was wrong and we were charged more today because we use 'too much milk'. let me reiterate, we buy 4 drinks everyday same order roughly the same time between two starbucks for at least the past 3 months. 

not only is this starbucks not going to get any more of our orders but we will definitely rethink our coffee destination of choice. just tried calling the store, and there is no answer"
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2013-01-31,3,"I mean, it's a Starbucks.

Not many other coffee options in the immediate area."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2012-11-22,1,Slow staff and no personality. Horrible service I ever encountered in a Starbucks
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2011-05-14,3,"Grabbed a soy peppermint hot chocolate as I was passing by the hood. Quick friendly service, just what I needed."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2010-07-24,2,"Slow, cramped, and not the friendliest bunch I've ever encountered.  Maybe it was the particular day i went, but my drink too WAY too long to make given the number if customers, and the damn cashier was having a full conversation in some foreign language (now just because we can't understand doesn't make it acceptable) with her friend who was not in line. Rude!
Not a good time."
59,starbucks-new-york-105,2010-05-11,3,"Friendly but cramped.

WiFi is always in working order and speedy, but don't come here if you're looking for a spot to ""settle in"". Because it is so close to the ""Airport bus"" shuttles, invariably there are a couple of people in here with their suitcases, jamming up the operation.

Maybe that's the reason there is never a long line in here.

Otherwise decent service, and usually quick."
60,paris-baguette-new-york-30,2020-01-31,1,"Food is perfectly fine, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. When I was being rung up, the cashier quickly tapped the highest possible tip option before having me sign off on the purchase. 

I understand the need for tips, but this seemed incredibly shady. It seems like an ideal thing to do to unsuspecting tourists who don't know any better. 

Be mindful when signing off on your purchase."
60,paris-baguette-new-york-30,2020-01-29,2,"TLDR: Very convenient location of Paris Baguette, right outside of MSG/Penn.

I've been going to Paris Baguette since they first opened up in New York in Flushing so many years ago. So when I spotted the signage they were coming to the Penn Station area, I was very excited.

They opened up in December of last year. It's a very nicely designed, more spacious than some of the other locations. They have soup available, a good variety of sandwiches, grab-n-go salad/sandwich/yogurt plus coffee and their famous cakes. There's a good amount of seating too, so it's convenient for a meeting or a meetup.

I've never had an issue with the quality of PB's product, here is no exception. I've tried the pastries at this location, the sandwiches and soups. They'e all great. So my problem is with the service.

Since they've opened I've visited about 6 or 7 times. It's convenient for me to grab a quick coffee or a small bite. I've only actually ended up getting something about half the time, every time it's a pain to flag someone down to help. I understand if I'm grabbing pastries/coffee, I'll end up at the register anyway. When you have sandwiches/soups on display though, there should be someone there to greet you. At the very minimum, I'd expect a team member to ask if I wanted to order anything.

So while the sandwiches, etc. here are great, I have to constantly wave at the end of the bar for someone to stop playing with their phone or chatting to help. Even when I've gone to the front of the register to have someone help me on the other side of the store, it takes effort to get the attention of either the cashiers or even the managers. 

Honestly, just tired of it. So will I pop in here occasionally? Sure, when I want a change from Pret (closer to me) or Starbucks (same distance). If I'm craving PB specifically, I might as well go to the K-Town location. The time it'll take me to walk there is probably when someone might ask me if I need anything.

Maybe management will change things in the future."
60,paris-baguette-new-york-30,2020-01-24,3,Tried for the first time this morning - nice place and very friendly staff. The coffee is great but sandwich was just ok. Paid $9 for med coffee & sandwich - too $$ for every day
60,paris-baguette-new-york-30,2020-01-17,4,"Large corner shop conveniently located 
across the street from the Penn Station. Pretty decent amount of seatings throughout. 

It has a variety of cakes and bakery items along with sandwiches and coffee. Was there to grab some light dinner around 6:30pm on a Friday evening and was pleasantly surprised to see that they were still bringing out freshly baked food. Turned out that the store opens until 11pm. 

Got the bacon turkey melt and prosciutto focaccia sandwich toasted to go along with a croissant. Very tasty and fresh. Loved how each item has label on calorie so you can make an educated decision. Turned out some savory items aren't that bad in terms of calorie count.

Glad to have another good option for a quick bite in the area. Service was quick and staff was friendly."
60,paris-baguette-new-york-30,2019-12-29,5,"We came here for breakfast, the croissants and other pastries were very fresh and delicious. The place was organized and tidy, great for a quick bite!"
60,paris-baguette-new-york-30,2019-12-28,5,"Wonderful croissants, sandwiches and coffee! Highly recommend this place for a quick breakfast if you're staying in any of the Chelsea hotels."
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-12-30,3,"Coffee is pretty good. The only drawback is that its so expensive, as are the pastry items they offer."
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-12-05,5,"Great service. I love the cheerful and energetic assistance provided by the employees.
Nice coffee and tea.. salted caramel is epic !"
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-11-10,5,My husband loves this place! He works in the building and goes here all the time. I've been to other locations and also think the coffee tastes amazing. Definitely a great place either for just regular coffee or more fancy drinks if that's what you want.
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-11-08,5,"Great coffee and toasts!! Excellent service, very friendly staff! Highly recommend this place!"
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-11-07,5,"Work in this building and go here regularly. Michaela makes me an awesome oat chai always and remembers to not make it too sweet like a lot of other coffee shops do. Everyone else is super nice there too, and they really run through orders quickly during rush times which is super appreciated when you have to run back to
The office!"
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-11-07,5,I get coffee from this location every morning and it never disappoints.  Eric and Gina are the best!
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-11-06,5,"One of my favorite shops to get coffee at! Always quick and friendly service. The cappuccinos are always perfect had to take a picture. I normally get an almond milk cappuccino and a croissant, but today I decided to switch it up and get their apple cider bundt. IT WAS AMAZING. These baristas really know how to make someone's day. Will always be coming back."
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-11-06,5,"Super convenient coffee shop where everyone is super friendly! Eric, Gina, and Cynthia all make the effort to remember you name and order! And they get it right every time. I always enjoy a nice latte and pastry when ever I can."
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-11-06,5,"Honestly, I only ever order iced tea and croissants, but the service is so great that it keeps me coming back! Eric and Gina are really friendly and wonderfully quick with orders!"
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-11-05,5,"Stop by this location today, since I was on the Flatiron location. Hiding spot inside the 11 Madison building, amazed by the lay out and service given at this location. Love all the plants, and decorations on this place, the amount of detail is spectacular.
Great team and coffee"
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-10-16,1,"The red-haired barista at the 28th Street location was absolutely awful. She was rude and condescending right off the bat despite being approached very politely by my partner and myself. Firstly, she spoke over my partner when he tried to order, wrongly assuming that he wanted the same drink as myself - twice. I ordered an ""Aussie iced latte"" with oat milk as I can't tolerate dairy, and she failed to inform me that the drink came with whipped cream in it. I'm pretty sure it's standard practice when taking an order where someone has requested an alternative to dairy milk to warn them if the drink comes with whipped dairy cream. When I received the drink, my partner apologised as we weren't aware of this and that I could not have dairy, to which she replied with ""you ordered an Aussie iced latte and you KNOW that comes whipped cream."" Firstly, this was stated NOWHERE on the menu. Secondly, she failed to inform me when I was ordering. Thirdly, I AM an Aussie and a standard iced latte in Australia does not contain whipped cream. She huffily said ""fine, I'll make you another one."" Her attitude was so appalling throughout our exchange that I was almost expecting her to secretly put dairy into the new drink (luckily my partner kept an eye on her and made sure she didn't). Honestly, nothing - not even a bad day - excuses such terrible customer service. The coffee tasted fine but we'll never be going back. It's unacceptable to speak to customers so aggressively - she's an absolute disgrace."
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-07-06,2,"Service wasn't good, coffee tasted sour, and it was expensive. It was my first time at this location and I didn't know they didn't take cash, and the cashier wasn't nice when I tried to give my cash. The large coffee was still a small cup and not worth the price. It had a sour taste to it. Not coming back. I walked out with literally and figuratively a sour taste in my mouth."
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-06-12,5,"A quick grab and go kiosk with friendly service and a smile. It has pretty much everything you could want that the full-service stores do. Recommend popping in if you just need a quick spot of coffee.

If you are in need of seating you are right across the street from the park so there is plenty of benches right there for you to hang out on."
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-05-06,3,"Awesome location and great coffee. But guy at register with 20 little pigtails is a little off putting, he kept touching his face and his nose then wanted to take my credit card... no thank you."
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-05-02,4,"Love this spot for a quick bite. 

Food: They were out of bananas so unfortunately, we couldn't get the banana toast which I was actually really craving. Instead we got the salmon toast and jam & butter toast. Salmon toast was pretty good, both toasts had a nice crunch and was balanced in texture and flavor, but both toasts were so taxed for what it actually was. This spot is definitely for my ""on the run but kinda hungry"" days. 

Environment: I actually really love how all of the Bluestone Lanes are set up - they all have a main theme, but each location branches our creatively to look different from one another. Super cute! 

Service: Decent. The girl taking our order was really awkward and didn't speak up, but she did seem young so it could've maybe been her first job?"
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-01-31,4,"If you've been to one Bluestone Lane, you've pretty much went to them all. Which is a very good thing, because they're arguably the top Aussie-style cafe of the many that dot the Manhattan coffee shop scene.

This particular location is in the lobby of the 11 Madison // Credit Suisse building and isn't a full-fledged cafe. Rather, it's a kiosk for a quick coffee drink mostly for people who work in the building, but you can also access it during most of the business day Monday-Friday. If you're craving a legit Flat White and happen to be around Madison Square Park, you're in luck."
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2019-01-09,5,One of my fav place to have a brunch in Manhattan. Iced latte and avocado toast are great. Highly recommend
61,bluestone-lane-new-york-24,2018-08-11,4,"Not very obvious location, albeit it's literally next to Madison square park--still gotta snoop around 

But coffee is always good."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2020-03-09,3,"Honestly I think starbucks tastes better and the price is more reasonable. Friends from LA come here and talk about how great it is, but I don't see the appeal regarding taste. They do make latte art, but it's very hit or miss. They didn't get it right for me and messed up the art they tried to make. I'm ok with this because I didn't expect it, but it's worth noting for people who might come here for this reason. 

The interior was also quite small. We didn't find any seating at first. It's not suitable for people who are looking to get work done while enjoying their coffee. This is a common practice at a cafe, and ample seating is a necessity. We also tried to charge our phones, and we couldn't because the ports weren't working. Again, this is a necessity. Hopefully they can fix done if the issues."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2020-02-24,5,"Amazing place for a great cup of coffee! My cousin has been raving about this place and I now see why! I ordered a Mocha, I would consider it as an adult hot chocolate. Has an espresso shot and high quality mocha. Please try this place!"
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2020-02-22,3,"came here while i was waiting for my time slot for the vessel. the wait to order was none but wait for my drink was about 5-10minutes (which was fine since i was waiting for seating to open up). i ordered a small iced matcha latte which came to $5.99 total - it wasn't bad at all (definitely a lot better than other matcha lattes i've had from other coffee stores). the staff are great and the seating isn't too horrible. overall, not bad, definitely will come back and check out other locations"
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2020-01-28,5,"LOVE the staff here! Everyone is so friendly, welcoming, and talented at making guests feel right at home. So unexpected for NYC.
Great escape from the NYC cold wind. Excellent WiFi, and even electric sockets for phone charging in the back corner behind the stainless steel column on the floor.
Ask team members for recommendations: they know coffee intimately and can describe each of their offerings in detail, from origin to subtle flavors.
From super bitter to sweet and sticky, and even savory snacks like avocado toast, they have everything an artisan coffee shop should. 
2nd floor of mall, limited seating, unusually passionate staff."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2020-01-15,5,"My girlfriend loves the green tea latte. Recommend it. Not too sweet. It's also close to the vessel, which is perfect. But you cannot bring drinks up to the vessel."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2020-01-11,4,"Located inside Hudson Yards this Blue Bottle Coffee store is one of the busiest I have seen. I came here during a weekday and it still had a line that was pretty long. 

I had ordered a winter latte with almond milk but the host said that almond milk was an extra charge and that if I substitute it with oat milk it would be no charge. 

So instead of getting it with almond milk I decided to get it with oat milk. My drink came out about 10 minutes after I had ordered it and it tasted pretty good. I do enjoy that they have dairy free options. Glad that the host told me about the oat milk! 

I would totally come back here to try other drink options too. They have some comfortable seats and also a standing area where you can sip your drink at. It is a little small but overall I thought the look was really pretty."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-12-29,5,"Amazing San Francisco brand . We were really happy to have it here in NYC .
Coffee is as good as it is at any other location. Thank you James .
Aura and Seni"
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-11-26,1,"Incredibly slow with their orders -  order took over 20 minutes and then the coffee was burnt.

Would stay away as there are better coffee stores around the area"
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-11-22,1,"Incredibly slow service. Lost my order.

Coffee price is also ridiculous charging $5+ for a flat white"
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-11-21,4,"Amazing coffees.  The aroma is just better than other mainstream coffee shops.  Their cold brew is one of the best in the area.  Most potent cold brew, the large size is very good value consider many can or bottled cold brews goes for around the same price but you can have a 16oz large.  Flavor is very intense.  The only thing they need is more variety creams and sugars."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-11-19,4,"One of my fav blue bottle locations in nyc. I love that fact that it's right outside of the vessel. 
Blue bottle coffee never disappoints it's minimalist and simplicity is what makes coffee so great."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-11-19,3,"Tried Blue Bottle for the first time here! Had seen it in some spots across California but funny enough had never ventured to try it until now. 

Overall, very pricey but good quality coffee/tea made here. I wasn't feeling the caffeine at the time, so I tried a hojicha tea, which was delicious and perfectly brewed with a nutty flavor. I can see how the quality of the drinks would demand a higher price, but Blue Bottle is still a little too pricey for comfort for me to want to frequent regularly."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-11-11,4,"TLDR: quick coffee while checking out the Vessel.
___

I'm a fan of Blue Bottle and I always get them when I'm in SF. In search for a quick coffee while checking out the vessel, I saw this was nearby.

There was a long line but I was surprised how Quick the staff was. They were also super friendly.

It's Pricy. But it's quality coffee in a convenient location. It's expected. 

I got an iced Cafe mocha. It was perfect. Bitter sweet. Strong. Delicious.  Drank it while I walked around the Yards.

This location is Up stairs on second floor."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-10-16,3,"I've always been curious about Blue Bottle, many people have recommended me to try their coffee. My friend and I came over to Hudson Yard because we were looking to try out 3Den for a space to work. Before going there, I wanted to stop by Blue Bottle.

I had the single origin Cold Brew and my friend had the Hojicha Latte. The Cold Brew was good, it didn't even need any sugar or milk. It was refreshing and smooth. Unfortunately, service here wasn't so great. I received my Cold Brew at the register as I paid. The Hojicha Latte took a long time. There were two people working on the espresso machine and it was still taking a while. My friend noticed the person behind us at the register have gotten their drink before we did. I had to go up and check up on our drink to get confirmation that our drink was still in line. 

The Cold Brew and Hojicha Latte was good, service can be better. Its tiny little space, expect a wait and crowdedness."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-10-12,3,"Blue bottle coffee is always good. I got the cold brew (single origin) and it was great. Smooth clean taste, just slightly sour but overall good and easy to drink. 

Service was kinda poor unfortunately. I ordered a cookie and the server forgot to give it to me after charging for it. I had to ask twice to get the cookie. I also ordered a the avocado toast which was completely forgotten. I was waiting for about 15 mins which was way too long so I asked and it turned out the order was never made. The staff was  apologetic but nonetheless the order was forgotten. Just seemed very disorganized and poorly coordinated..

But the coffee is great. Still love blue bottle , jsut this location's service was subpar."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-10-09,5,"Blue bottle is by far my favorite coffee spot in NYC, and this is by far the best location. Staff is so cool and friendly, even though the place is always busy. They never mess up my drink (which is what it's all about)....the is always clean, and I can usually get a seat( wish it was a little bigger with more seats)."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-10-07,5,"Fantastic warm welcoming service. Highest quality coffee, as expected from this brand."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-10-05,4,"I ordered moment notice with oat milk. loved the coffee.  Friendly service,  limited seating.
I bring my own sweet n low because most places do not have it."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-10-01,5,So I found out Blue Bottle offers oat milk free of charge. Which I really respect because most - if not all - places charge for milk alternatives. Will definitely make sure to give them more of my business because of this!
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-09-29,5,Heard about this coffee so I tried it. Got a cold latte and it was strong. Made me want to use the restroom within the hour which is perfect because that's what I use coffee for. It's on the second floor of the mall next to the escalator. Super long line. They don't have any sippy cups to drink which is wack but still bomb.
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-09-25,1,NEVER AGAIN. I ordered a double espresso over ice and when it came out I thought it was a joke.  I asked the barista if that was a double and he mumbled yes and some other nonsense. There wasn't even a mouthful of coffee in the cup. It's pathetic the price the charge for nothing. I will not recommend this place at all. There are plenty of other places in a Hudson Yards to get a nice double espresso.
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-09-23,5,That was hands down the best iced coffee i had. Friendly service and short wait. The sitting area could have been bigger since a lot of ppl were getting a drink there but we found a seat so i can't complain. The location is also fantastic
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-08-22,1,Dark bitter drip coffee and cold cappuccino. Yeah we're not going back
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-08-15,3,My waffle is tasteless (but hot which is good). The coffee was not bad. My dad's complaint is that they did not ask if I wanted it here or to go and got a paper cup (he wanted to drink his cappuccino in a porcelain cup lol).
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-08-10,4,"It wouldn't be that hard to offer a few packets of sweet n low for us diabetics. I get that you guys are too good for that but seriously, sweeteners don't have to be a moral issue. 

I didn't try the coffee because I ended up getting my money back. I'd rather give my money to corporate Starbucks.

Edit: Blue Bottle contacted me with an apology which seemed sincere, and which I appreciated. They say they don't want anyone to feel like they are left out of enjoying their coffee and they are bringing in a new sweetener option. Yay!"
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-08-10,1,Zoo-like atmosphere with long waits to order and after you order.  Spartan seating and amenities.  They do not offer low-calorie sweetener so not good if you're trying to cut calories.  Indifferent service.  Numerous better options in the mall
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-08-02,5,"blue bottle coffee is always excellent. this location specifically, though, was exceptional. clean tables, lots of seating, good area. nice!!!"
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-07-29,1,"I visited here around 5:30pm last Saturday, and have unpleasant experience. While I was waiting for my coffee, I figured out the customer who ordered after me received his coffee. So I asked to the barista when my coffee will come. She asked the name I told for the order, check the order, and put the coffee cup down aggressively in front of me and said ""here's yours"". The coffee splashed a bit on the table. I was at a loss for words for a while and asked ""Are you mad?"" So she said ""No, it was not offensive"" and pretended focusing on her work. You guys should teach the barista how to serve the coffee."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-07-28,5,My first time here order a large ice latte with almond milk. It was surprise me the coffee it was delicious and I like a lot. They don't take cash at all. Lucky I bring my Visa card with me.
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-07-07,3,Recommended by a friend who works near by that area. I ordered a cold brew iced coffee. Nothing special. I had better. Coffee tastes little bit on bit bitter side. The service is nice though.
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-06-09,2,"$5.99 for a 12 oz. iced mocha? F@&$ off, Blue Bottle. Why must native New Yorkers pay tourist prices? There's an inherent evil in this business model and the corporate overlords will have your souls in hell. Too much? Maybe, but so is your godless iced mocha. I don't care how much rent is at the spectacular spectacle that is Hudson Yards; no mixture of milk and coffee, twelve ounces no less, should ever amount to the price of a beer."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-06-01,5,"Got a dark roast and a latte. Both were excellent, as in ""Wow, this is really good coffee!"" Who says that?

At the top of the escalator in the mall, it's open and situated among large windows overlooking a small plaza. 

Drinks only come in one size. They have pastries as well, though I didn't try them"
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-05-25,5,"First time at Hudson Yards and I see there is a HELLA long line at Blue Bottle Coffee. Holy Moley...

My question is why? Blue Bottle (My favorite coffee) are all over NYC, there is no reason to have this place slammed. Maybe the initial opening of Hudson Yards and The Vessel had the tourists out in drones. 

My wife and I walked from 14th st on the High Line. We went to Hudson Yards and saw *No Line* as the escualtor reached the 1st floor.

Now its on. Wifee is not feeling the chicory in the New Orleans iced coffee. That's ok, she doesn't eat mayo or doughnuts either. More for me.

I think I sauntered up to the counter??? One New Orleans Iced Coffee please. I'm given a biodegradable straw, Nice Blue Bottle, nice.

Blue Bottle, You rock!"
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-05-13,4,"I ordered a decaf almond milk latte, for here. It took quite awhile for the barista to make it, I'm not sure why as she started right away. She also made it in a to go cup but offered to pour it into a mug, which kind of defeated the purpose of ordering a latte for the latte art so I declined. The latte art was a little weak though. But the coffee was quite good, very smooth and velvety."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-05-07,5,"I'm a huge fan of blue bottle's mocha and hot chocolate. I like that after taste of mocha. I was glad to hear that they opened at Hudson Yards. It was small and at the corner of 2nd floor overlooking the entrance to the highline. View is great, there aren't that many tables but surprisingly Hudson Yards itself wasn't too busy on a Friday night anyway. 

Staffs here are courteous, menu items are a bit expensive as it's the Blue Bottle!, but I like their coffee. I love the little mini brownies and dark chocolate they sell. They go really well with regular latte or coffee."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-05-06,4,"We stopped by here after visiting the Vessel for a quick drink before heading back to Brooklyn. The line was pretty long, but all of my family members and I were pretty happy with our drinks. I got a green tea, and it was a little oversteeped, but it had a really good flavor!"
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-04-22,5,"Amazing coffee! I often stop by this location for a morning pick me up & the cold brew is just the thing to keep me going throughout the day. 
Just about every other coffee aside from the cold brew takes a considerable amount of time to prepare. If you order any of these be prepared to wait... probably while standing in a crowd of tourists & nearby office employees--who are likely wondering whether it was worth it to be squished like a sardine for the caffeine."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-04-18,4,coffe is fine but waitting is too long.  near 10 minutes for latte .  i didnt bother to ask for suger cuz they r too busy but all suger jar is empty.  still a good coffee place if you dont mind wait or no seat.
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-04-16,3,"PICK UP THE PACE! Consistently good coffee at a great location. However, the pace is of a turtle and w/ one barista completing the orders mainly in the morning it's grueling to wait. I have literally timed it from the moment I order to completion and I've waited 10-15min. Just standing there amongst others that need to get to work. I've noticed the on occasion assistant pulling espresso shots ...is only doing that..instead of fully completing an order.
HUDSON YARDS BRINGS IN A BIG CROWD OF SHOPPERS ETC & ITS THE ONLY GOOD COFFEE INSIDE THE MALL. So, why would you not have 2 baristas all the time. I've seen ppl leave because of the long line. 
#2: What is up with them running out of ALMOND MILK for the third time already BUT always have *oat milk. Hmmm I wonder why! Its definitely less popular than almond and has a distinct taste which isn't an overall crowd pleasure. TAKE NOTE AND PLACE A BIGGER ORDER MANAGEMENT 
#3: If you want a 3rd shot ...they charge you for a quad! Like does that make sense. Every other good coffee place ..has the option of paying just for one.
#4: THE ONE SIZE IS WAYY SMALL AND OVERPRICED FOR THE AMOUNT YOU ARE GETTING. A few sips of an ice latte and it's done. You need to set that standard size you serve as the small and offer a larger option.. REALLY."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-04-16,1,The service could not be slower. The prices are ridiculous. Maybe if the baristas didn't socialize so much they would speed up somewhat. I will never go there again.
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-04-07,2,"Too hip. Too austere. Seats look cool but are not ergonomic making comfort impossible. 

The limited menu includes some of the most acidic coffee experienced by this reviewer in NYC. 

It seems the appearance (looking good) is more important than serving good coffee or keeping a clean dining area."
62,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-18,2019-03-20,5,This place has delicious coffee and a friendly staff. They have a small seating area where you can take a break from your shopping too!
63,starbucks-pickup-new-york,2020-03-03,5,Best Starbucks in the vicinity. The people go out of their way to make your morning rush ever so pleasant! My drink is always ready and ALWAYS correct. Shoutout to Cece for being super wonderful!
63,starbucks-pickup-new-york,2019-11-23,5,"Well this makes sense - NYC busy town USA has this new location which is not your standard Starbucks cafe concept. Here you order ahead and pickup, hey just like the name! 

Use the Starbucks app and pick it up. I tried it in the afternoon for a Chai Latte (just so you know) and it was ready when I got there. No one was there, it was a quiet time. I wonder what it is like during a rush in the morning. Will have to try and report back. 

I observed customers coming in and ordering a drink in the shop, makes sense and is inclusive. 

There is no seating inside, very clean and barebones. There is seating usually outside near Pennsy/Penn Plaza nice during the summer. 

Check it out, it could save you some time. Hey it's NYC we're busy."
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2020-06-15,3,"I honestly just came in here for a quick breakfast sandwhich and tea combo. For the price it still wasnt completely worth the value. But the tea was great, had a sore throat at the time so this was God sent. The breakfast sandwhich honestly wasnt good. Bread was hard cheese was dried out and melted (ik how). It was a mess but honestly I knew what I was getting into. 

It has other food options as well, those look better but price points shakey for me. Same with the drinks. What I mean by ""shakey with the price"" is that it's high and I can spend it but I know I can get it cheaper.

Its convenient for what you need. ‍"
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2020-03-07,4,Great spot for breakfast or a casual lunch! The lunch bowl with fried fish is especially good. Also love the hot chocolate Service is very friendly. Wouldn't recommend online ordering since they run out of ingredients sometimes.
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2019-11-15,1,"Service was bad and after I paid for my lunch that's when they told me they did have half of the things I ordered and already paid for. They couldn't give a refund, Never going back again."
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2018-12-23,2,"Not a great experience. They were either out of or no longer carry the first four items that we attempted to order from the menu. Once we finally found something, the wait time for the food to come out was lengthy and we soon realized that was because our food was sitting on the counter while the employees we're busy chatting. Once we finally got to eat, it was not very good. The veggie tacos are basically broccoli on a tortilla with no sauce. Will not be returning."
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2018-09-18,1,"All I want is an egg and cheese sandwich on a roll.  I've tried ordering it multiple times on multiple days and they've gotten it wrong every single time, and charged me extra for the privilege.  All I have right now is a sad, dry roll with an unseasoned scrambled egg. Don't bother with this place.  It's empty for a reason, and Gray's Papaya down the block is faster, cheaper, and has gotten all of my orders right."
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2018-08-22,5,"This is a casual place in midtown for tasty food and drinks. Also, the new staff is polite and attentive"
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2018-08-22,1,This place has horrible service and mediocre food. They are also super slow. I order really basic stuff. I ordered bagel with cream cheese. It takes 10 mins and I get toast with butter. It's a tourist trap that survives being next to the Empire State Building and selling beer to construction workers.
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2018-08-14,1,A mess. No organization and very rude. Also don't know how they got an A health ratimg because the cook was rubbing his gloves on his shirt and touched his mouth.
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2018-06-22,2,"They're food is okay. Flavorful but if you don't get it when it's freshly made/once it comes out, don't bother bc I've gone as late as 3pm for lunch and the food looks like it's been there ALL day. I also ordered a bacon egg and cheese this morning at 9. And while I couldn't eat it right away, by 10:25 I opened it up and it looked like the most unappealing bacon egg and cheese I've ever ordered down here around 34th. The bacon is not cooked all the way, there's a large glob of mayo and the cheese has congealed (granted I left it out for an hour) but I've had far too many better bacon egg and cheese's (whether I ate it right out the store or waited until I settled down at work) to be able to enjoy this one. 

Anyway, I will say that it's a good spot for a drink, or if you just want to see what they have for yourself before eating at their buffet."
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2018-06-14,3,"Came in for a quick bite early morning!! They have delicious Colombian coffee, tasty bagel breakfast sandwiches and friendly staff!!"
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2018-05-11,2,"Came in. Got a coffee with a splash of half and half but i don't remember ordering a cup of half and half with a splash of coffee. 

Ordered a sesame bagel with cream cheese cucumbers and green olives but I got a plain bagel with cream cheese black olives and cucumbers with some shmeers of peanut butter from the dirty knife. 

Listen to your customers!!"
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2018-04-02,1,"The cashier girl is soooo unkind. First visiting here, I don't know about menu and everything she never reply even when I called more than three times she just ignored me and did her job (just putting the coffee) at least she could reply when I call, and no explain about combo. Service is Sucks. Foods are cheap and a good location but from in the morning I feel it's a terrible day."
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2018-03-05,1,"RUDE cashier. I've been coming here for a long time and we have always been nice to each other but today she snapped at me for waiting on line to pay without the food actually being in my hand. Everyone I know that comes here we order and then go pay and then wait for our food. Even the manager had told me to do that a few months ago because he wanted the line to keep moving. 

Today she let 2 people skip in front of me without having the audacity to let me know why. I had to speak up and say ""what about me? I've been waiting on line"". Then she flips out and says ""everyone got their food in hand and you don't!! So they need to go first and keep the line moving"". I told her all she had to do was let me know and I wouldn't be upset but her lashing out at me was not appropriate. Also I've been going their for so long and this is the first time I've heard of this ""new rule"" when paying!! All I had to do was tell her what I ordered and pay and step to the ordering counter like how everyone always does!!!! 

Horrible customer service and of course the other cashier doesn't say a word."
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2018-01-30,1,Staff is very rude. If your not Spanish they don't acknowledge you. It's very frustrating going here in the morning and waiting 5 min for them to even take your order. When a Spanish person walks in their order is taken right away. Just go across the street to market crates which the food taste better or speedys.  This place still sucks. The Spanish lady in the morning flirts with these guys all morning and could careless of you standing to pay.
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2017-09-14,5,Fancy a good happy hour after work? No so many place will offer BOGO in Midtown but here. It's a perfect place to grab some beer and get some finger foods.
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2017-05-26,2,"There were only a few people ahead of me on the ordering line at 8:35am on a Friday. I ordered a sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin. $3.50 was the base but got charged for English muffin and cheese- kind of weird, but okay. So sandwich is now $4.50 without tax. That's fine. But then 20 minutes later I am still waiting for my very simple sandwich. Finally it's ready. I walked out, running late to work, close to 9am. Too long of a wait for an underwhelming breakfast sandwich. Could have used some salt. Cashiers never cracked anything close to a smile. Ketchup packets to go are offered at most delis, but not here. Meh -_-"
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2017-04-25,2,"I went here only a couple of times and haven't gone back until today, bad decision. Food selection is like your typical Spanish food spot in the Bronx but the taste isn't there at all. I paid $8 and change for salty under cooked rice and stewed beef. Service is fine and I'm usually in and out but the food sucks. It's a lost cause."
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2017-03-31,2,"After this place changed from Kito's, everything sucks!

Prices went WAAAAY up, food isn't cooked how you ask (ordered scrambled eggs but got them runny), they rarely make home fries anymore (either that or you gotta be there at 6am to get them), and almost all their employees are rude! One of the cashiers from Kito's right before they closed is still there and the attitude from her is ridiculous. 

I only give 2 stars because they are open late if you need to pick up something to drink or some chips and because there are TWO sweet, sweet employees (african american cashier lady & a mexican cook) that are super nice and go out of their way to help you."
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2017-03-16,1,"No hyperbole, this is the WORST deli on the face of the planet. . .The wait to order is exceptionally long, the wait for an egg sandwich is exceptionally and the order accuracy hovers somewhere around 0%. . .

This used to be Kito's and it was serviceable, now that its Zoni it sucks. . .

I went in the other morning for a bacon egg and cheese on an English muffin, nothing complicated, and after about a 15 minute wait, what I got was close, but not quite right (bonus ketchup). . .

I only discovered the issue when I got back to the office, so being a believer in I should get what I pay for I trucked back over to get the correct sandwich. . .

The cashier seemed helpful taking the sandwich over to the cooks and explaining the issue. . .I assumed corrections were made and my sandwich was replaced. . .

I checked before I left and SPOTTED no ketchup, so back to work I go to enjoy my once a week treat, and with the first bite I discovered that my sandwich was not replaced, the ketchup was merely scraped off. . .

So I had a choice, suck it up and eat or trek back, well, I've already got about a half hour invested in this egg sandwich so, what the hell, back to Zoni I go. . .

This time I ask the cashier for my money, instead of a new sandwich as I am officially done with this place, and posting a scathing review on Yelp. . .

As she hands me my money back she tells the cooks the sandwich still is not right, one of them comes over and goes, ""No, look, no ketchup.""

""That's right,"" I say, ""you can't see it because you scraped it off!!!"" My voice rising into a yell @ the end because now I am beside myself in rage @ my denial of the worlds perfect sandwich.

I walked out and used my $5.00 to purchase a not as satisfying copycat from the fast food place down the block.

There are better choices in the neighborhood. . .

Choose wisely. . ."
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2017-03-16,1,"you get what you pay for. I get the same thing but always pay different. If you are not Spanish don't expect good treatment. I am bottom of the barrel. I order my food 20 minutes before I have to go to work. It never fails, everyone that orders after me gets their food first and then I get mine last. I am always left scrambling out with 2 minutes to run to work. Market crates is the way to go. Across the street. It is first come first serve, very attentive and not that much more."
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2016-09-30,1,"You get what you pay for here. It's one of the cheaper delis around but the food never looks that fresh and the cashiers are rude and lazy AF. They may have done a mini reno but its still a dingy hole in the wall.
I go here thinking its going to be convenient cause i work at the Empire state building but waiting 25 mins for 2 eggs on the roll in the morning is definitely not making my life any more efficient. Plus if you stand in there for more than 5 mins, expect to walk out smelling like bacon grease.
The lunch steam table goes out about 11:30am and doesn't get replenished so if you go there after 1P there's basically not much left but some sauce and scraps. Stuff in the deli case- like the graying cold cuts and chicken salad look AWFUL. I would avoid unless you want to entertain food poisoning.
And my one last gripe, I had $4.90 of food and the credit card minimum was $5. They refused to accept my card unless i bought something else to meet the minimum. Terrible customer service!"
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2016-01-01,5,"New ownership, new taste! Kitos was pretty good but this place rocks!. So much variety and extremely friendly service. Met the owner on my first visit and he is the nicest guy! NYC just gained a hidden gem in Zoni Cafe!"
64,zoni-cafe-new-york-8,2015-12-07,3,"Yes! Finally we have a local spot for legit Caribbean based Spanish Food in the area.  I believe this buffet lunch spot was recently taken over by new management and I checked them out after getting a flyer advertising Spanish food.  I've eaten there twice so far and I have to say it looks promising.  You serve yourself from the buffet and I believe it is $6.49 per pound.

They have the typical fare as you'd expect.  Pernil (Roast Pork Shoulder), Carne Guisada (Beef Stew), Bacalao (Codfish), Pollo Asada (Roast Chicken), Maduros (Sweet plantains) and rice and beans.  I had hoped to see Arroz con Gandules (Rice with Pigeon Peas) but they have white or a yellow (Sazon) rice only and red beans on the side.  The food is well seasoned and flavored but a little bit dried out, they're probably not turning over everything so need to figure out scheduling.  Hopefully if more people start to go here their stuff will be fresher and they'll offer more Spanish food.  There's also some different salads and stuff too but it's still a pretty small offering but Zoni definitely holds promise.

Update 03/17/17: I have to downgrade them one star to three because as other people have stated the staff their are rude and a bit shady which has really put a damper on me wanting to eat their regularly.  I hope the business owner actually reads these reviews and considers removing and replacing the cashiers because they are hurting your business."
65,dunkin-new-york-6,2019-09-29,2,"There was probably three times as much space behind the counter as there was for us cramped customers in front of it, and that still wasn't enough space for them to support an adequate number of employees staffing it. And I think one of them was in training, not really sure of what to do at various times. They actually ran out of coffee while I was placing my order, so we had to wait about 2 minutes for enough of a new batch to brew to serve, at which point they regrouped, restocked, etc., in the back. I asked for cream with my coffee, but I noticed I got whole milk - it even said so on the sticker on my cup. I thought Dunkin' usually put light cream in their coffee, as one of the ways it makes the coffee more palatable to the customers. The bagel for my bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich was pretty dry too. It did get me runnin', just not on full speed right when I wanted."
65,dunkin-new-york-6,2019-08-16,2,I order an ice coffee with with cream and liquid sugar and also croissant bacon egg and cheese. my coffee looks like it's just straight cream with a dash of coffee and my croissant looks like someone fisted it. I only come here because it's conveniently located across from my office but i rather go to a farther one
65,dunkin-new-york-6,2019-06-27,4,"""Holy Floor Baseboards Batman!""

Seating? What's that? Don't stop by this location if you want to sit down with your beverage and meal because there is zero seating at this location.

There's a Starbucks on everyone corner in NYC so why not a Double D, and I don't mean bra size either. Dunkin seems to be adding more shops in NYC, so it seems, and this is a hole in the wall shop for pick-up only. You can order online or just stroll on in to get some grub but no seats and barely enough space in the store for four simultaneous customers means you order in and get the freak out!

Donuts are always super fresh and the staff always very pleasant."
65,dunkin-new-york-6,2019-04-03,5,"So i live in the west coast. I go to dunkin donuts here and there, but it does not compare to any east coast dunkin donuts. They are so good here! Everything is so delicious. The coffee is so cheap compared to the west coast! Almost half the price. Even the donut selection here is incomparable! They have so many choices here."
65,dunkin-new-york-6,2019-01-04,4,"It's a Dunks. Not much to review, they seem to just be everywhere. Fast service and clean but I'd recommend ordering to go because the place is so small. Myself and one other person waiting for an order made it feel super crowded"
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2018-08-25,4,"Love this express Dunkin. A few blocks away from my job, very quick service. 

It's not an eat in Dunkin, it's a walk up order and keep walking Dunkin"
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2018-07-06,3,"This is my go to location on my way home from work. It's an express window, but they're a bit slow. I usually don't mind waiting. I've had coffee, donuts, wraps from here several times. It's an inexpensive and easy stop for a quick drink or bite. I just recently tried the new donut fries ($2) that came out and I feel very ""meh"" about them. I thought they'd be more flaky and croissant-like but they kind of taste like cinnamon sugar pretzels (except staler). I wouldn't buy them again--I'll stick to the basics at Dunkin' Donuts."
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2018-06-01,4,"This is an Express/Window pick-up location only. Lines may get long during the rush but I promise they move quickly. Been here a few times for a breakfast sandwich order and have experienced friendly and efficient service. 

Best thing about this location: bacon is always crisp! Most locations are lazy and will give you soggy limp gross bacon - not here!

And the hashbrowns have always been fresh when I've ordered them."
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2018-04-11,4,"It's Dunkin Donuts in NYC.  It's reliable.  It's dependable.  It's cheap.  

I got an iced tea with extra granulated sugar and lemon.  Guess what?  It was an iced tea with extra granulated sugar with lemon.  

I didn't take a picture of my drink, but it was exactly as ordered.  It is the same thing I always get and looked like the same thing I have gotten in every other location."
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2018-03-15,1,"Terrible service! They did not allow me to redeem a coupon, for no absolute reason!"
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2018-02-22,1,"I had placed an order for an iced coffee and was order #386. It was fairly busy so I waited in line, but I understood it wouldn't be the fastest service because it was the morning rush.  However, once the employee started calling numbers that were 15+ after mine, I asked her about my order and she seemed confused and motioned towards making it immediately.  Then when she called another number (#411) and I accidentally picked that up thinking it was mine, she said to me ""no, that's not yours. I told you, I'll call you"" very rudely. Another minute later, she called my number and didn't apologize at all for the delay. The employee was very rude and not at all apologetic. I was not happy with my service.

I won't be coming back to this location when there are others near my job."
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2017-03-25,3,another typical dd on the corner of 37th st and broadway but this location has not seating inside cause there is no inside with all ordering done at the first window and pickup at second window  so it's grab and go to a point .the usually assortment of stuff and maybe a bit more in selection . sometimes the line is long but wait time is short as i was on my way to the lovely post office and was in the mood for a frozen hot  chocolate which this location seems to make just right for me. for some reason unknown to me the office workers and tourist seem to really enjoy the breakfast sandwiches which is available all day . overall 3 stars cause they have not screwed up my order to date and they are quick .
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2016-06-28,1,15min waiting for a small coolatta at 3pm. Something isn't adding up here. I think maybe if they didn't hire a degenerate who thought they were so sneaking having their headpiece on and making gestures to their homie to give him free shit; the wait time wouldn't have been so long. Get it together!
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2016-03-28,2,This is a DD cart type where you order thru the window and the donuts aren't fresh and small. I guess you gotta accept whatever when that caffeine hunger strikes.  2 stars.
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2015-11-13,1,This DD can't get a simple order with one item (sandwich) correct.  Another customer who was waiting also had this problem.  Next time I'll walk a little further to a DD who can complete basic orders without error.
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2015-09-22,4,"Thank you, Dunkin' Donuts on the corner by my office, for being the epitome of quick service. I've never waited more than 2 minutes for something here. The only reason you get 4 stars is because of the annoying people giving out samples/flyers/whatever else on the corner that hassle people in line."
66,dunkin-new-york-68,2015-08-11,5,"It was a busy morning at 8:30AM on a Friday. I ordered medium hot french vanilla coffee with cream and sugar, bacon egg and cheese crossaint, and hashbrowns. The staff was extremely pleasant for a morning rush. My coffee was made quickly as per everyone else's and I soon got my bag of food and ran off to my office two blocks down. I go all the way up to my office and sit to eat and realize they gave me the wrong bag. I was bummed. I went back to the dunkin donuts walk-up and told them they made a mistake and the lady apologized and said she did make a mistake. She immediately re-made my order and gave me my bacon egg and cheese sandwich plus more hashbrowns and I was able to keep the other sandwich,(although I really didn't want it) - the staff was so pleasant, everyone was smiling and working hard. I appreciated their hospitality and I would reccommend this Walk-Up Window to anyone that asks for a suggestion! I would definitely go back...."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2019-09-09,1,Went to get a burrito bowl. They have me half a bowl and told me that's how it was supposed to be. Wrong. I called corporate. They don't know what they're doing. I got a refund and left.
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2019-08-06,1,"cashier : stephanie z. very rude, evil unable to provide proper customer customer service."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2019-04-28,3,"With the standard menu, the distinguishing feature of this Dunkin' Donuts is that it's a city location, so it's a tight space.  There's standing room only downstairs, but seating upstairs.  I tried the cold brew coffee, which tasted fine - exactly as it does at other Dunkin' Donuts. 

Would I go back?  Sure, if I needed something quick on the way to Penn Station again, and I hadn't planned ahead.

FYI, the restroom was out of order on a Sunday morning."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2019-04-26,1,This place is disgusting. The dust is 1/4 inch thick on the speakers. The windows are covered in dust. The floor is slippery from grease or oil.  We only popped in because it started to rain.
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2018-11-10,1,"The worst service I've ever received in my life. Employees were incredibly rude and uninterested in the customers along with completely ignoring me. And to add to it all, the employee opened the door while I was in there after I repeatedly said the bathroom was occupied. I felt disrespected and I'm unsatisfied with the service. I normally love Dunkin Donuts but this was unacceptable."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2018-08-17,1,"You want anything consumable, do your self a favor and avoid this place. Everything is dirty, employees are rude and just worried about rushing orders out. Worse DD I've ever spent my $$ at."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2018-07-15,3,"DD is dime a dozen on the east coast but from someone from CA, it is exotic! I used to live next to one when I was going to school in the East Coast and have fond memories of breakfast here.

Was nice to see this location all done up with Halloween decorations. The donuts are ... just OK."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2018-06-27,1,"Went in at 7:30 at night and stood in line for 12 minutes, ordered a decaf to which the guy responded ""I don't have any fresh decaf, do you want one iced?"" Who doesn't have decaf ready to serve at 7:30 at night?"
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2017-12-15,1,"The staff is rude, the place is absolutely filthy and I am pretty sure that lady in the corner is giving a handjob. Avoid at all costs."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2017-12-02,1,"We have been here several times and the sitting area is never clean.  Ever.

The server is very rude, ordering people around and not listening to those people trying to give their order (we tried three times).

A convenient location but the experience is not worth the Convenience."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2017-11-09,2,"I mean its Dunkin' Right? What could you say about this place that hasn't already been said or heard before right?

Well, I stopped by this location in the middle of the night for a coffee fix and asked for my drink ""Light and Sweet"" which is how I usually order my coffee and they didn't get it right. Whenever I stop at any Dunkin' and they're unable to make my coffee fix sweet enough I don't feel like returning. Seems simple enough I would think.

Their fast food donuts are decent though."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2017-06-25,5,Great experience when visiting NY and getting a hot chocolate fix at midnight. Great service!
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2017-02-24,2,"We tried this places TWICE before we even wrote a review. The first time we came here it was really late night and on our way to our hotel. You come to New York and you gotta have Dunkin Donuts and this location was open 24hrs. It was past midnight when we came to this location so the store front was closed, but the side window was open and you can still order donuts. 

We got the chocolate frosted and strawberry frosted. We were not impressed. The donuts were stale. We gave this place the benefit of the doubt and tried it again. We figured the first time was a fluke due to the time. Nope. Fail on the second time too.

If you enjoy stale donuts come here!"
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2017-02-23,3,"24 hours! You can't beat that specially at 1:43am in the morning here in NYC.
After midnight you can only order through the small glass door. They also turn the lights off so it seems closed. 
I tried the chocolate glazed and the strawberry glazed donuts. The donuts were ok but I mean it is 2am so they've been sitting there for a bit. I do still give it 3 stars because it wasn't hard or stale. The guy that helped me was very polite and courteous. 

This place was the second place I went to eat at NYC. This location was next to the hotel so it was a convenient. There's a 7-11 nearby and also 2 brothers pizza for that classic thin crust pizza."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2017-01-26,1,"Had a very unpleasant experience at this location tonight, unfortunate given that I had come here a few days ago early in the afternoon and had been very happy with my experience overall. This Dunkin' is advertised as being open 24 hours, so I stopped in around 10:30 PM for a coffee and a coolatta. The service was miserably slow. With three customers in front of me, I probably waited around 15 minutes to place my order and complete my transaction. The upstairs dining area was closed off, and the only seats open were the four window seats that were being occupied by customers. When I got my coolatta, two of the customers finally left and I prepared to sit down, only for one of the baristas to yell at me across the store that they were closed while standing next to the ""Open 24 Hours"" sign. He then waited by the door until I left. I fully understand that days are long and employees want to leave, but please don't advertise a Dunkin' being open around the clock if it really isn't. I wouldn't have stopped in if the place was closing that soon, and my opinion of this Dunkin' wouldn't have diminished as a result. I will not be back at this Dunkin' location while I am in New York, unfortunate as this has been my only negative experience in the City thus far."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2015-09-05,4,"Not bad.  Quick and easy to deal with. Much better than the DD across the street! Free wifi and seating upstairs. Personally, I give them four stars for getting me in and out in the am in less than 7 minutes."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2015-05-19,1,Girl that took my order forgot everything I ordered the second after I told her. Skim milk? Just coffee? Large size? Nope everything was wrong and she even gave me bad attitude when I tried to be understanding.
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2015-05-17,1,"Incompetence runs supreme here. Good luck figuring what line to wait on. After waiting and being subject to idiocy I said forget it, my money's obviously not good enough and left."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2015-03-17,1,"This place is the epitome of New York. Unorganized and a little dirty inside; if you don't speak up you may never receive your order. Though not the fault of the staff, the space is typical small NYC but the poor design of the registers with no dedicated order pick-up area makes trying to get a coffee and any sort of food during rush hour mornings interesting to put nicely and annoying to put bluntly. Two blocks down (or right across 8th Avenue as I discovered today) features a much more spacious and accommodating DD location that will continue to get my business when I'm in town for work. The girl who gave me my coffee after I had to ask for it was cute though."
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2014-11-14,1,Worst experience at a DD ever. Rude associates and the food came out terrible. Don't bother coming to this one!
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2014-04-24,3,This place is a great dunkin donuts because its big and there is a huge seating area. However the donuts are $1.09 which doesnt make sense as they are a dollar almost anywhere else. Their coffee is good and regular priced so im happy with that. The workers however are not very nice and VERY impatient. Once when I went and I wasnt even on line and I was thinking about what donut I wanted and they kept asking me if I was ready to order. They are supposed to wait for me to say I'm ready to order. I don't like that and the dunkin in my neighborhood is friendlier. 3 stars
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2013-09-15,4,Decent DD in New York City.  The staff here was friendly and did not mess up my order.  I did have a hard time understanding what they were asking me though.  The store was pretty clean and was in a good location to where I was staying.
67,dunkin-new-york-111,2013-01-29,3,"This is one of my favorite location of dunkin donuts because everytime i come visit NY I always stay either on 36th or 39th street so this is perfect during my walk around town. However, because of its location, its always busy. This is a very busy street corner so it always feels very cramped in here. There is about 4 seats facing 37th. The entrance is also small and little to get in. Other than that, my coffee was wonderful!"
68,coffee-cart-on-35th-and-5th-new-york,2014-01-14,5,These guys are so great!  I text them my food order 15 min before I want to pick it up and it's always ready for me and still warm.  I always order some kind of egg sandwich either for breakfast or lunch and it's always made perfectly.  I have never been disappointed or annoyed that they forgot something because they have never messed up.  I have been going to these guys for the last two months and now I refuse to go anywhere else to get my sandwiches.  Their prices are probably the best in NYC too.
68,coffee-cart-on-35th-and-5th-new-york,2009-06-05,4,"Best value in the area especially because there is a crappy starbucks right across the street that charges 3x as much for mediocre coffee.
The gentleman in the cart is gracious and efficient. There is usually a small line before 9AM . A small coffee is 0.60 and large $1.00. The coffee is pretty mild and not bitter or burnt. Never tried the pastry.
Bottom line: hassle free coffee with friendly service, all for 1$ or less"
68,coffee-cart-on-35th-and-5th-new-york,2008-09-06,4,"The most inexpensive iced coffee in midtown, in my opinion, and it compares favorably. (I know it's iced coffee, so there's not a lot of nuance-but still bad coffee is bad coffee) The man who runs it is friendly and quick to recognize regulars. He also has a few other things. I think I've seen croissants, something that looks like a doughnut, but I've never bought any of these from him. Just the coffee, and how you like your morning coffee is up to you. Do you want a half skim milk/half coffee blend? Starbucks has a more expensive name for that drink, but at this stand it's still a ""iced coffee."""
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2020-04-30,1,Horrible after Michael left. Such a joke. rude staff. Unfriendly. Removed benches at the coffee bar. No longer will be spending my money .... what a shame
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2020-02-10,5,"I always look forward to my morning stop at Gregory's Coffee on 1407 Broadway in NYC.  Not only is my coffee always great, but all of their staff are exceptionally friendly!!   If there was a 10 Star, I'd give this place a 10!"
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2020-01-13,4,"I'm so happy I finally decided to try this place out! I was getting fed up with another v popular coffee chain (whose name shall not be named but you probably know who I'm talking about), so I decided to drop by Gregorys, since I always walk past it on my way to work.

I had downloaded the app prior & received $5 off my first order, which was pretty good! The prices are very fair & I love that they offer oat milk. I also like that they have a wide variety of items to offer, including tea and smoothies!

Upon walking in, the decor was very nice and inviting. There wasn't a line, so that was great! I ordered a lavender latte with oat milk and a croissant. The barista who took my order was very nice. My order came out very quickly. I was excited to try the latte because I thought lavender sounded really good & I wasn't disappointed!

The coffee has a great taste - it doesn't have that burnt taste & it's just the right amount of espresso for me. The lavender syrup itself was very yummy and comforting as well. The croissant on the other hand, tasted a bit stale. But, I would definitely go back for the coffee. All in all, a great coffee shop for when you're getting tired of the other ones."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-12-03,5,"Stopped by an hour before closing and was pleasantly surprised by how warm and welcoming the staff were! Wish I would have noted their names, will try to next time I visit.

Their apple fritter and blueberry muffin were fantastic too!"
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-11-21,3,Decent coffee.  In crowded field of NYC coffer houses it does not stand out.   There our better.  Only gets 3 stars because it was clean.
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-11-10,5,"Every time I drop in for my coffee, the manager, Sapphira has been so kind, attentive and accommodating (I need my almond/soy milk heated separately!). She has always made sure I got what I needed with a genuine smile and no questions asked. I appreciated her great service. This is a great coffee shop with pleasant and generous people who make sure my coffee is perfect. This is what makes people come back. Thank you, Sapphira."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-10-11,5,The iced oat milk lattes are amazing. Hands down my favorite in the city. Servers are friendly. Free unlimited WiFi. Great place to work.
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-10-01,5,"Do you want a good cup of coffee? 
Do you want a friendly customer service experience?
Do you want delectable and moist pastries? 

This place has the answer: You got it, dude! 

I go here daily and am always treated like the god I am. So if you're sick of having your name misspelled and drinking burnt coffee. You should definitely come check out the team at the 1407 Broadway, Gregorys."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-09-26,5,"Let me set this off with Gregory has the best Nitro, period. But when it comes to this place the customer service is just tops. All other surrounding coffee shops are full of suckas with their noses in the air drinking coffee that's worse the David Chang's cooking. The espresso is smooth like the lines on my rapide. Coffee cake like cooked coke, and they make a Chex/Rice Krispy treat, like who thought of that sh!t. DEAD. Aight, you get the drift. Get your coffee from this Gregory's on Broadway and west 39th and don't cheat yourself going anywhere else, that includes the Gregory's down the block from them, that's the fake Gregory's, it's really a Jorge's with Gregory's glasses on. Stay woke!

The Rapide is an Aston Martin. Yes you F()cks I own one! I don't sell drugs either."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-09-24,1,"Found foil in my pastry and had a horrible customer service experience. I used to come to Gregory's Coffee somewhat regularly until I found foil in one of the power bites one day. After reaching out to them twice via the website about this, no one got back to me. No one would answer the phone at the location I went to. I finally reached out to them on Instagram and they wouldn't respond or they kept telling me they'd do something or credit me for my next few orders and then wouldn't do it. I had to continue hassling them and they finally (after a lot of back and forth) gave me $5. Ridiculous."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-08-10,5,"My go to spot during a visit to nyc.  Spent a couple of hours there every morning during my stay.  Decent coffee.  Awesome healthy breakfast options with parfaits, overnight oats and other creative things.  Also seats with outlets readily available.

Only one thing.  Their POS has the tipping in reverse order so the percentage decreases from 25% on the left to 18% on the right.  Opposite.  Sneaky."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-08-07,3,"Personally did not love the coffee here. I accidentally loaded $20 dollars onto the app the first time I came her, so I have had to visit a few times. I tried the Nutella coffee, which was my favorite drink I got here. The regular iced coffee I have gotten twice and was not a fan. It almost tastes sour? The iced tea was also alright but kind of small. So overall, I haven't had a good experience with drinks here. 
However, I have gotten crumb cake and the peanut butter banana energy bite and both were sooooo delicious! I would recommend coming for either of these!"
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-07-02,5,The latte coffees here excellent. I absolutely adore the leaf design on my latte. It was first time getting coffee here. I also tried the wheat chai donut was also super good. The maple French cruller however was not as soft as I expected it to be. Perhaps it wasn't as fresh? Not sure but next time I'll be sure to stick to their donuts instead.
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-05-06,5,"While there are plenty of Gregory's locations scattered around the city, this one will always have a special place in my heart for their exceptionally friendly service. I LOVE the morning team here. Working as a barista isn't easy especially in a place as busy as midtown but the employees here give you an extra dose of energy with their smiles and all around cheer. They do an incredible job of maintaining the store cleanliness which makes you want to stick around a little longer before heading into the office. Thanks for making my mornings, especially Mondays, a whole lot bearable!"
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-05-01,4,"Nice little brewery, very good drib coffee.
This one has glass front from where one can look out on the avenue and do some people watching.
My friend loved her special tea with lavender taste.
Staff is friendly and knows what they're doing.
Clean toilets!!!"
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-04-11,2,"Guys, please either hire new baristas or just hire more of them. I am so tired of killing 20 minutes of my life every morning getting coffee.
The coffee itself is decent, but the wait times are so ridiculous it's just not worth it. It's really not that good.
I think I'll be looking for better options in this area."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2019-04-05,1,"If I could give this location zero stars (or negative stars), I would. Service is absolutely terrible and the baristas are inefficient in the mornings to the point where you not only have to wait 25+ minutes for your simple drink order, it's like you're in the stock market trying to get the barista's attention for when your order (if at all) got through - even when you ordered in person! Staff is unfriendly, unapologetic, and needs training on how to be efficient and service oriented. Would not recommend this location."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2018-10-13,4,"If you have been to midtown you know there is a Starbucks every 400 ft or so...
So this place is down to earth you wanted coffee come and get it coffee. No bull shit with your coffee just shit that wakes you up. They also sell donuts for $3...

The choc chip was awesome....the chairs are kind ancient...i would,recommend a make over on the furniture"
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2018-09-12,1,"I will NEVER buy coffee from Gregory's ever again. I just had a horrible experience at this location where a barista spilled ice coffee all over me ruining my clothes and shoes. Trust me, I know accidents happen but the staff, including management, were nonchalant and apathetic and offered no resolution. When I complained for their lack of caring, he just mentioned I should be lucky it wasn't hot coffee. Are you kidding me? I will never ever visit their stores again. They really need to have better training in place for staff and management."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2018-09-08,3,"Cafe chain from NYC with decent coffee and tea. There's a decent amount of seats and is usually pretty clean. They have power plugs if you are looking to charge your phone or do some work and their free Wi-Fi is more than adequate for browsing. Very easy to order a head and pick up via their app or through Level Up. When you sign up for the first time, they even give you a $5 credit and you can earn loyal rewards for frequent purchases. Some of the staff are very friendly and I enjoy see them on my frequent visits while others seem to be permanently upset to be working. There was one that I recall sweeping the floor who repeatedly was also polishing customers shoes with the broom and laughing about it while they were verbally upset. Not sure how she is still employed there."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2018-09-04,4,"So pretty inside, same theme as nearby Gregory's but still has its own distinct thing going on! Love what they've done with the place! 

I'll always love Gregory's. Solid service, great coffee and tea, nutritional information available for everything, good WiFi, delicious pastries, and lots of space. Sometimes I wish they switched out their latte flavors with some new ones, but I'll be patient and see. Anyway, this is a relatively new location. It's quiet, music tends to be a little on the loud side, but in terms of people, it's sparse. I love the window seating! 

Hoy, I got a green tea and shared a carrot cake. Tea was lovely and fresh, as was the cake. They complemented one another well. I love how thick and fluffy the cakes are at Gregory's. They could easily be shared among 2-4 people. Or not! Get a whole piece all to yourself while getting work done here! Gregory's is great for being productive! 

Mission to visit every single Gregory's in the city continues!"
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2018-08-30,4,"While all the other coffee shops are packed in the area, this one is quite empty. They offer your typical caffeine fix as well as hip options like charcoal latte or matcha latte. Their baked goods and food options look great too"
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2018-08-22,1,"This is for review of the Honey Bee toast to go.... No just NO. Sad price of bread with thin layer of ricotta. Combo of honey olive oil salt and pepper just didn't work well together. $7 for this sad piece of bread ,sigh."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2018-08-19,5,"I come here every day. The nicest, most helpful staff in midtown Manhattan."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2018-06-21,5,There are two Gregory's near my office and within a block of each other. I love them both. I love the coffee and I'm a snob about coffee. Theirs is one of the few that is really good enough to drink black. Don't get me started on the baked goods. I can't take it. The Chai glazed whole wheat donut and the Chex Mix treat are amazing. The people who work at both locations are exceptional. I'm so impressed. I hope the company keeps growing without losing any of its charm.
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2018-06-06,5,"I always wondered why all my coworkers religiously go to the Gregory's near our office, with other cafés just as close by. But now that I've been, I get it. When you've had your fill of just-okay coffee and pastries... I get it. 

Starting with the coffee, their iced option is just the cold brew, so I tried that. Normally I avoid cold brews because I find them too strong and bitter, but Gregory's is great! It has a nice subtle sweetness to it. 

The pastries are the best part, though. With the enticing selection they have on display, it's hard to not walk out of there with one in hand (or in mouth). The vegan bar is is probably a healthier option, and it tastes healthy but not in a bad way, chocked full of seeds and dried fruit. It's a delicious energy boost! I've also gotten their banana chocolate chip muffin (also vegan, amazingly). I took it home and heated it up for a few seconds in the microwave and wow, it was a gooey, chocolatey masterpiece. 

It's easy to get lost in chain after chain in the heart of Midtown, so I love having a convenient option for high-quality coffee and seriously good baked goods."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2018-05-16,5,"I really like it here.  I refuse to go to the Starbucks down the street (that's a story for another time) and I'm really happy Gregory's is right near work.  They are very quick, friendly and the coffee/baked items are very good.  I was reading some of the negative reviews and honestly it takes a lot of work to deal with tourists and NYC people everyday, so props to the staff who make my experience a breeze."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2017-11-19,5,"The service here was really good. The coffee is great always from this chain, but the service here is the best. This location is a bit small but everything is clean. The milks are always full as well as the sugar. My coffee always stays hot even after I put the milk in, that's the best part!"
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2017-10-28,5,"Best coffee in New York by far!

I'm from Italy and I'm very faithful to my espresso still. I always found American Coffee to either to light or too strong like Starbucks. When people ask me why don't you like Americans coffee I said: ""taste burn "" especially Starbucks. 
One day I was at a friend house and he made me a cup of coffee without asking me if I wanted one, politely I accepted, after my first sip my reaction was ""WOW man what coffee is that"" He said to me ""Gregory best coffee in the city "". Since then I've been drinking American Coffee everyday (only Gregory coffee). The best part is that the coffee shops itself are really cool too and they have great service, well managed and incredible muffins. 
I also bought their mug and I love it to. It keeps my coffee hot for long time, never ever spill coffee,  It's easy to clean and it's a really good looking mug 
I'm so happy I found out about this brand. 
A Good cup of coffee makes a difference. 
I totally suggest this place."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2017-09-10,2,"Nothing to write home about. One lady was extremely rude. The other one made us wait forever behind the counter while she cleaned up and did other things, no ""give me a minute or apologies"".  Why bother go back?"
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2017-08-30,5,Nice to place for a coffee and treats. Good location. I believe it was the manager who gave me a free chocolate muffin after hearing me tell my sis i didnt want anything. Im not sure what it was called but i sure did appreciate it and it was SOOOO GOOD. Rated this 5 stars because the nice cozy place and nice staff members. My sis and cousins food was real tasty too!
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2017-07-28,1,"Very nice new location with terrible staffing. I really don't get why Gregorys management would spend a lot of money in a brand new store and then hire people who clearly don't want to be working there. I went there 3 different times just to be sure that it wasn't bad luck. Each time was either the only customer or one of 2-3. They were rude to everyone. This last time, there were 3 staff behind the counter and it took forever to get my order. I had to call someone over to take my order- they basically ignored me when I walked up to the counter (I was the only customer in the store). The person never spoke one word to me. When I ordered a smoothie she only looked at me with disgust for ordering something harder to make. I just felt super uncomfortable there. It such a huge difference from the store on 39 and 7th where it's always full of customers and the staff is super nice. I am a big fan of Gregorys but won't be going back to this store!!"
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2017-07-24,1,"Usually I only write wonderful reviews for Good service and food ... but here at gregorys this is why there wasn't the usual coffee crowd on a Monday morning. This morning the applied  rudeness unprofessional +snarky way the mgr let Amanda...throw a spongy scone from afar into a garbage when I asked if their bakery items were crunchy or soft was so improper ...most places would know their products or would kindly cut the scone allowing a customer to try it...she just threw it in a bag leaving no choice to either break off a piece or bite into it.. Once I broke a piece off I knew it wasn't what I wanted. 
Gregory Zamfotis take note
to how Pret+Starbucks amongst many more coffee/ breakfast places are around your location have highly trained pleasant workers who take pride to ""welcome"" customers."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2017-06-10,4,"I was visiting NY so I didn't realize this location was new until I looked on Yelp. It's definitely beautiful and very comfortable with a good amount of seating. We really enjoyed the several locations we tried while in NY. I will say my husband wasn't a fan of his cold brew. Sad, I know. He actually ended up throwing it away...and we're talking about a man who throws nothing away even if he doesn't like it, especially coffee. Not sure if they brew it in house and they're still learning or it was an off day? Either way, he wasn't a fan. But we liked Gregory's overall."
69,gregorys-coffee-new-york-26,2017-05-17,5,"Beautiful new location! It's a block away from their older location, so not sure if that one will close down. Staff seems like they're still in training/learning, but everyone seems very friendly :). They now have a curve-around line that might make the crowds easier to manage. Pick-up area now doubles as bar seats, but is much bigger than before, hopefully that makes coffee pick-up during the morning rush much easier!"
70,senbird-tea-new-york-2,2019-05-28,5,"This tea shop is a cute little hidden gem that shares space with a vintage kimono shop. The packaging is elegant and great for gifts.  They have a variety of Japanese teas, like brown rice tea and roasted green tea, with samples laid out to smell and see in porcelain dishes. 

Don't forget to grab a sample of their delicious matcha chocolates too!"
70,senbird-tea-new-york-2,2019-04-12,5,"Met the friendly staff and was happy to see their range of authentic Japanese teas!  You can take a look at their teas on display in this showroom location.

I've also tasted their matcha chocolate; couldnt resist to buying a few bars for the family since it was that good.  Looking forward to seeing more from them!"
71,dr-smood-fashion-district-organic-cafe-new-york,2020-02-13,5,Good spot but doesn't have bathroom which was a bummer. Love the nutrient dense food.

71,dr-smood-fashion-district-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-10-29,5,"I m always please with this chain
Great fresh food and usually great service too
I order through Postmates today and food arrived perfect 
Packaging is good and hold the food. Avocado toast was not damaged by the trip and staff prep the box very well"
71,dr-smood-fashion-district-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-08-16,3,"I came in to pick up a MealPal. There are no signs outside. This is so WeWork space. They are in the lobby. After I scanned my MealPal code I proceeded to the cashier. She looked at the pickup screen on my phone l and asked me to scan the code to which i replied, I already did abs that's why you see the pick up screen on my phone. No apologizes, just a ""oh"".   They don't have the smartest people working here. Nor are they great with customer service. And she gave me my order, just like that, no bag. 

The 3 stars is purely for the product."
72,think-coffee-new-york-17,2020-02-14,5,"Excellent service and quality.  I just ordered the house blend, black no milk or sugar. The coffee was smooth and  perfectly decent to say the least. The barista was friendly and helpful and knowledgeable."
72,think-coffee-new-york-17,2020-02-12,1,"not great like the other branch and they wil charge you more than you used to pay !
i always pY for ice mocha with oat milk for6.50
every different locations only this one charge you an Extra i paid $7.08  i asked employees in there she said different owner ???"
72,think-coffee-new-york-17,2019-10-16,5,Such a lovely place to have coffee  They have jazz music and a very friendly staff. A little quiet heaven in busy ktown
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2019-02-19,1,"If I could give 0 stars I would! Went into this location to purchase a beverage that was being promoted through my T-Mobile Tuesday App! I was really excited to try this beverage and was able to get a $2 Dunkin Donuts gift card towards my purchase as per T-Mobile's Promotion for this beverage!! I went into this location an encountered the manager Anita D. at the register. I kept showing her the picture of the beverage that was being advertised. After going back and forth for about 5 minutes, I ended up purchasing the beverage even though I knew she wasnt correct on what she sold me. I thought to myself ""let me just purchase the item and have them make it and see if it resembles the picture off the T-Mobile App"". A different lady made the beverage (who was very pleasant to deal with mind you) and when she handed it to me it was a regular iced coffee. I had told the lady who made the beverage that this isnt what I wanted nor was it what was depicted in the picture. I decided to explain to the lady who made my beverage that while I was speaking to the manager Anita D. who was at the register that I explained AND SHOWED the picture of the beverage I wanted she insisted that it was an iced latte when I knew she was incorrect and didnt know what she was talking about. IMMEDIATELY when I showed the lady who made the beverage the picture she knew exactly what the beverage was, knew the promotion that was going on, was able to explain what beverage was being advertised, was very polite, AND apologized that the manager was incorrect. 
Im not one to complain nor write bad reviews, but I'm beyond pist off that the manager was rude, had no clue what she was talking about nor did she have any clue about the products she is selling at her place of work!!! HOW IS SHE A MANAGER OF DUNKIN DONUTS AND DOESNT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ICE COFFEE, ICED LATTE, AND A FROZEN COFFEE IS CRAZYYYY!!! And she kept going back and forth with my over the $2 Dunkin Donuts Card when I said multiple times that I DIDNT CARE ABOUT THE MONEY AND THAT I KNOW IT WAS $2 OFF (not that the beverage was only $2)!!!! NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER GOING BACK BECAUSE OF ANITA D. NOT BECAUSE THE COFFEE DIDNT TASTE GOOD BECUASE IT WAS ACTUALLY DELICIOUS!!! The lady who made my frozen coffee needs a promotion! Maybe she should be the manager and and Anita should be demoted and study what she is selling/serving!!!"
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2018-08-05,1,I ordered an iced green tea that was over-brewed and very bitter; I asked the manager for a replacement to black tea but we wanted me to pay more! Needless to say not coming back to this location
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2018-04-21,3,I came in at 3 pm and it was pretty empty however it still took awhile  to get my drink since there was only one employee.
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2018-03-12,1,I dont even want to give a one star. Very rude and worst customer service ever. Store manger is yelling at the customers. Its only few dollar coffee but why she screaming to customer? Never ever go to dunkin!!!!!!
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2018-01-12,1,"Third time this has happened. I always get a coffee in the morning before going to workout. The hours on the door say that they open at 5 AM. It is now 5:47 AM and the employee inside will not let me in as he hasn't finished setting up for the day.

I wish there was a Dunkin' Donuts closer to the R,W subway on 28th street because this place sucks."
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2017-12-20,1,"The worst Dunkin' Donuts I've ever been to in my entire life. They manage to mess up every order, even if it's as simple as a small hot chocolate. Would rather walk the extra couple blocks to 28th and Madison DnD's"
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2017-12-19,1,"I've been going back to this Dunkin this year after having many wrong orders last year. The food has definitely improved, my orders are usually correct, and the staff are always very friendly. The woman manager in particular is friendly and remembers your order if you come in often.

Unfortunately today i experienced a first, when one staff member treated my coworker with disrespect and began yelling at her in the store. He called the receipt number without saying what was in the order. Typically, they announce both since many people lose their receipts or aren't handed one at the register. When my coworker asked what was in the bag, he was very short, said that's why you need to keep the receipt, and took the order away not giving her the order she paid for. Meanwhile my coworker is trying to find the receipt in her pocket and pulls out one from the day before (she's a regular here, so much so that when she walks in the manager called out her usual order before she even made it to the register), so she's only asking what's in the bag so she can recognize her order. She begins telling him to calm down because he is clearly getting heated. Then he locks eyes and literally starts yelling at her. I couldn't even get his attention to tell him to stop yelling, he just ignored me. I've never seen that before, and I kept trying to explain to him that 1) not all of us get our receipts at the register, 2) she's actively looking for it so just calm down and stop yelling and 3) not all of us can read the receipts if we have vision problems so it's easier to say what was in the order.

It was very disrespectful and the most absurd treatment of a loyal, paying customer I've ever seen. Someone like that should not be working in a customer facing business."
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2017-10-05,3,"Pros: convenient location, empty seats, fairly clean!
Cons: overpriced, slow service (when there is more than 2 people on line), coffee is hit or miss --either good or very weak."
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2017-04-09,1,This location had a worst cashier whose name Jenny J.....sooooo mean to Me....made Me so upset in Sunday morning.....this person should be fired.....
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2016-06-03,5,"This is my favorite Dunkin' Donuts location! I order here almost everyday while on my way home from work. The baristas are always pleasant and the store is clean. I'm a regular here and once Apaar sees me come through that door, he automatically makes my latte and has it all ready for me once I reach the counter!"
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2016-04-14,1,"How hard is it to get an order right? I asked French Vanilla less swirl and extra cream. Repeated it three times she nodded.  Even told the person making the coffee she said yes. I even came back told them it is too sweet and  she supposedly replaced it. She gave me a ""new"" one which tasted exactly the same. I would drink my coffee first before coming here. Never had a problem with other Dunkin Donuts location. I won't be back."
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2015-10-29,1,"This location is clearly the reason why the company is supposedly going under. I've never had anything bad to say about Dunkin in my 30 years of existence until now. Where does this company find such incompetent creatures to staff this location? Is there where all the horrible employees go right before they get fired in order to torture both badly behaved humans of the Dunkin Doughnuts staff and New York City? Thanks for making my morning coffee purchase a little easier 6th Ave Dunkin and your purely idiotic staff. Thank you. I have plenty of other options. As a bonus, I walked back to work feeling a bit better about my lot in life."
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2015-06-20,1,Food was fine but the cashier girl talks to you like you're a frikken idiot. Just because we couldn't understand your mumble doesn't mean we're slow. If you hate your job so much then leave.
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2015-05-17,3,"Its busy a place.Specially on weekdays during day time.But service is fast and accurate all the time.Usually two cashiers are working in same time.There are four tables and some other seats face to the window.But tables are always crowded.

Last time I was here,there were two blind customers behind me.One worker who was working in kitchen, came to front and took those blind customers to door way after they received the order. Everybody admired what he did. 
I had medium frappachio coffee with oreo donuts and I love it."
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2015-02-22,2,"Bumping it up a star as service has been better and better. It still seems like there needs to be a lot of improvements but at least there is forward progress. Nothing wrong with the coffee or food here at all, just the wait time on getting the things you order."
73,dunkin-new-york-152,2014-12-30,1,"Stale donuts at 8 pm on a Tuesday. First D&D I've ever been to where the donuts were stale. Not sort of hard, flat-out stale."
74,nuts-com-new-york,2020-07-16,5,"I recently discovered this company during the pandemic and have ordered many times.  Every product is delicious, well packaged and delivered so quickly.  Their customer service is impeccable.  I highly recommend and look forward to continuing to try more of their products"
74,nuts-com-new-york,2020-07-03,1,I placed an Internet order of candy and assorted nuts.  When my brother received the package it has warning CANCER and warning BIRTH DEFECTS labels attached to the products.  My family refuses to eat poison....and I paid $62.94 for this shitty garbage.  Why would they send me poison????
74,nuts-com-new-york,2020-05-27,1,"Those Hazelnut's I ordered from you were the worst, stalest Hazelnut's I have ever had! Are you buying old nut's from somewhere and reselling them? Your Cashew's were the worst I have ever tasted also. I noticed you screen your review's so you only post the positive one's. GOOD THING!"
74,nuts-com-new-york,2019-09-12,1,"I have been a loyal customer the past  year or so ...I had a bad experience w/ delivery...I complained and was blown off by customer service.I reiterated my dissatisfaction by Fed Ex ground delivery, offered UPS ground as an alternative and again was summarily dismissed. I guess they do not care as much as they claim..Off to the competition.."
74,nuts-com-new-york,2019-04-12,2,"I used to buy quite a bit from Nuts.com, however, since becoming more aware of the plastic crisis the globe is facing, I'm not going to continue to purchase from Nuts.com until they offer sustainable packaging.  Everything is shipped in plastic bags, and there's just no excuse for that anymore.  Plastic is cheap and easy, which is why companies use it, but the problems created by plastic are truly deplorable.  For more info on why plastic is so bad, see The Story of Stuff site: https://storyofstuff.org/."
74,nuts-com-new-york,2019-03-05,5,"I have been a loyal customer of Nuts.com for many years. They have a phenomenal mail order operation. Frequently if I place an order on a Monday, I might receive my package within 24 or 48 hours. Their customer service department is incredibly responsive and I am always astonished at how generous they have been to me. I'll give you a few examples: a few weeks ago we ordered 3 bags of Turkish Unsalted Pistachio Nuts. My wife was disappointed since she had wanted the salted ones so I called their customer service number and asked if I could return the two unopened bags. Instead, I was told ( to my astonishment) that they had sent me three new bags of salted pistachios nuts ( st no additional charge) and told me to keep the nuts I had received! I thought this was very classy! And just this week, after I placed an order for more of their salted Turkish Pistachio Nuts when I noticed an email from Nuts.com announcing $10 off new orders, I emailed and asked if they would give me the credit, even though I missed their promotion and I just received a response assuring me that they added the $10 credit to my order!

While I have shared with you the qualities of a great company's customer service, what really makes Nuts.com so special is their extraordinary products! They have the most amazing selection of nuts, spices, coffees, candies and many other snacks and treats! They sell many products that are kosher and vegan.  When I need to send someone a birthday or get well gift, not only do they have exceptional gift items but they have the coolest gift cards that can be purchased that are funny and very clever! Imagine the joy of receiving a giant card that says: Happy Birthday You Nut!  My friends and family look forward to those cards every year!

If you have never checked out Nuts.com, you have been missing out on a truly amazing family run company!"
74,nuts-com-new-york,2019-01-17,3,This is the second time I ordered their dried chestnuts. I was disappointed the first time but thought I give them another go.  Well I was disappointed again. There is too much inner skin left on each chestnut and since we eat the chestnut dried as is this is most unpleasant. It almost impossible to remove the brown inner skin.
74,nuts-com-new-york,2019-01-14,4,"I order online from Nuts.com.    Very good experience !!  Ordering online was super easy.
Delivery was packed and delivered before I expected to receive it.  Product that I ordered was great.  I ordered all superfood powders this time around,  the powder was great super fine.   Taste was great!!  Blended up well ,,,
Packaging was fun !!  (I spent about five minutes just reading the box).   And they threw in a couple of samples of different things for me to try.
This was the first time I ordered, and I will definitely order from here again"
74,nuts-com-new-york,2018-12-21,2,"I love this company's Chocolate products and jellies, however on one online order I also ordered Bear crunch popcorn and it arrived stale.
Now like all companies they ask for online reviews for any and all products you purchase, this is where I have a huge problem with Nuts.com, they posted all positive reviews I gave for the products I truly enjoyed and found to be a value but my negative review of the Bear crunch was never posted. Reviews are meant to help consumers choose wisely on how they spend there money and if a company chooses to post ""mostly"" only the positive reviews and disregard the truly not so positive reviews then I tend to lose faith in this company."
74,nuts-com-new-york,2018-12-11,1,This is so overpriced it's ridiculous!! Your not inventing the wheel here. They refused to send me a free tin of nuts because they finally had a sale and couldn't combine promotions. I've spent HUNDREDS of dollars at this site and for and extra ten dollars they wouldn't give me the free tin. Guess what the word is out there. Spend your money somewhere that cares about their customers.
74,nuts-com-new-york,2018-12-01,4,"This is pretty cool place. Nuts that you babe find anywhere else are nicely packed and waiting for you here. In the past I would swear by them, but lately something really happened to them-one out of 5 bags always arrives stale. This time it was Sachs Inchi superfood nuts. Very disappointed especially it's not cheap."
74,nuts-com-new-york,2018-06-25,5,I really enjoy their packaging and also the shipping is quick. The chocolates are great.
74,nuts-com-new-york,2017-03-17,1,"I have ordered fruit slices from Nuts.com in the passed and was satisfied with the quality and packaging of the product.
HOWEVER, this last order I received was AWFUL. It was packaged in a plastic bag, and were VERY thick. 
You fruit slice lovers know how this can affect what you are used to getting and this is NOT what I want.
Will be finding a new place to shop."
74,nuts-com-new-york,2016-12-16,5,"Nuts.com is fantastic!!! I live in Manhattan where one can find just about anything, but Nuts.com is THE ONLY SOURCE for certain hard-to-get items, such as chestnut flour (the main ingredient for my famous castagnaccio). They also carry ultra fresh, high quality pignoli nuts imported from Italy. Incredibly fast shipping and reasonable prices, too. Nuts.com is a godsend to all discerning cooks and nut lovers. I will be a loyal customer for life. Thank you Nuts.com!!!"
74,nuts-com-new-york,2016-11-14,1,I am deeply disappointed to hear that a credit on a customer's account is only good for one year.  I can no longer buy from this establishment  as their rules are not fair.  I was never informed  of a limited time for credits. There are many other candy stores available. Thanks but no thanks.
74,nuts-com-new-york,2016-04-15,5,Awesome selection! Perfect mix of healthy snacks and cheat day sweets. The staff is super helpful. Go to their website for even more!
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2019-06-30,1,"Bad service. My friend ordered an iced chai latte and they gave her iced coffee instead. I asked for an iced coconut latte and they gave me an iced latte plain. And they didn't pay attention when we were ordering, hence why our orders were wrong. Booo."
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2019-01-15,1,"I've never been to a Dunkin' Donuts before and with all the commercials on the tele, why not give it a go as you're passing by the many in NYC. Ordered a simple hot chocolate and lord, it was overwhelmingly sweet and the consistency was too thick, much like syrup. It's going to be a no from me."
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2018-10-30,1,"I pass by this Dunkin' Donuts often on my way to work and I've been here a few times usually to get a jelly donut or their bacon, egg and cheese croissant when it's 2 for $5. Most times the wait is long as they usually only have 1 cashier (sometimes 2). Today, when I went for the 2 bacon, egg and cheese croissant for $5 ($5.44 with tax) deal, which is the only reason I come here most times, they screwed up so badly I probably won't be back.

First mistake-- I realized as I was giving the cashier cash that she punched in only 1, making the total $4+. I told her no, I said 2 bacon, egg and cheese croissants. For some reason she couldn't punch the 2nd one croissant, so she had to get someone to calculate the total and my change on her phone. And they didn't give me a receipt.

Second-- when they called my order, it was only 1 croissant. I told the guy that I got 2, and he said the order only had 1 and that I should tell the cashier. I was irritated, but I've already spent more time than I wanted waiting for my order, so I went to the cashier to say that I only got 1 croissant when I ordered 2. She brought the order back to the guy and talked to him. 

Third-- and this is the one that's making me grit my teeth right now in extreme irritation-- she (the cashier I talked to) put something in a bag (I thought it was the bag I gave her) and gave it to me, and ok, my mistake was not looking closely knowing that they already screwed up twice. I brisk walked to work as the whole thing took longer than it should have. When I got to my desk, I took out the items in the bag, and instead of 2 bacon, egg and cheese croissants, they gave me a sesame bagel with plain cream cheese and mini hash browns! I gave these away since that wasn't really what I wanted to eat. So now, not only did I spend a lot of time waiting for a simple breakfast order, I overpaid for something I did not want and I still want bacon!"
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2018-09-12,2,"Listen, I know it's Dunkin Donuts but this $2 ham and cheese wrap was garbage food. I really think they need to try harder."
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2018-08-21,1,It's always dirty...the garbage is always filled To the top with garbage lying around. The workers are never paying attention and mess up orders and the customer service is horrendous if they even know what is going on.  Beyond nonchalant when they know they messed up on a simple order
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2018-07-17,1,"Worst experience ever. Ordered a beverage and told Abu, the cashier, that I wanted to use a free beverage reward when scanning. He did it wrong, like didn't even process what I was saying. Then instead of refunding me and doing it correctly, he told me to move out of the way for the next customer. I hope that he learns to treat customers better in the future.  6:45pm July 17th"
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2018-07-16,3,"This is the closest Dunkin' to my job & the train so that is mainly why I am here so often. They don't have enough employees for the amount of traffic they get; there's almost always a line so I try to mainly do on the go orders. They only have 2 cashiers, 1 barista & 1 person making the breakfast sandwiches. They aren't the best but they get the job done."
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2017-11-15,2,Sabina is a real asshole I would never come back here. I asked for my coffee light and sweet so I understand that it would be a little less hot than usual but it was cold so I asked to heated up and she was going crazy and her language to her son or the other guy there that night
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2015-09-07,3,"Map's in the wrong borough here, so stick with this version http://www.yelp.com/biz/baskin-robbins-new-york-20"
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2015-06-18,3,"Line was short in the morning and a very quick turnaround for my order. I was hesitating at first with the previous reviews, but much seems to have changed in the three years since. 

I lied, a few months ago. In the morning it isn't bad at all. I tried going after work on two separate occasions and both times were... Weird I guess? The first one, I was told they couldn't make a particular kind of drink I was craving so I sajd I'd come back the next day, and then they made my drink anyway? Second one the guy was chewing gum so aggressively that I couldn't understand a word he was saying, and he was frustrated at me for not knowing what he said. It was weird."
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2012-09-23,1,"As the other reviewer said, this place is horrible. The staff here are terrible and if you're in the mood for a coffee, you'd best head over to the startbucks across the street."
75,dunkin-new-york-72,2010-12-29,2,The staff are terrible there but I guess the bar wasn't set very high because the coffee is terrible as well.
76,starbucks-new-york-586,2019-08-25,5,Love this place!  Nick the barista is awesome as well!  It's a hidden gem! Not crowded long lines! Perfect for now!
76,starbucks-new-york-586,2019-06-14,4,"I was so excited that there is a Starbucks only a few stores away from the AMC 34th Street (between 8th and 9th Ave). 

It's a bit small without much seatings but it is your typical Starbucks with the usual items that you crave for every morning, midday and possibly night time. Unfortunately it didn't have the shortbread that I wanted. 

Staff was friendly. It wasn't too crowded yet but of course it may change depends on the time of the day. Welcome to the hood!"
77,dr-smood-murray-street-new-york,2020-02-10,5,Wonderful Staff. They are kind and welcoming. There are lots of healthy options to enjoy! There are tons of vegan options if you are try young to make that life change! The teas are delectable and the food is scrumptious!
77,dr-smood-murray-street-new-york,2019-09-24,2,"Amusingly overpriced even for this neighborhood. Wouldn't be so bad of it was a decent portion size but for 17.00,  you want the container that holds your lunch to weigh more than a feather and not be swimming in dressing (when you asked for dressing on the side). And lastly, if you pay a hefty additional  price to add salmon, maybe add more than the tiniest sliver. This place is a caricature."
77,dr-smood-murray-street-new-york,2019-06-25,4,"Coffee + sandwich/healthy food shop, Dr Smood offers a lot! Their milk alternatives are made in house and the macchiato I ordered was great. Interior is nice (they opened a month-ish ago) though not a great place to do work as seating is limited. Minus one star because their food is a little pricey and their payment system has  been extremely slow/buggy."
78,dunkin-new-york-80,2018-10-28,5,"We stopped in after dropping off luggage to be held at a nearby shop. The manager, Muhammad, was very friendly and helpful, especially since we were ordering a unique drink for someone who wasn't with us. We were confused about the fine print on a donut coupon, but he took the time to explain it to us, and gave us the coupon deal regardless. His positive attitude really brightened our day!"
78,dunkin-new-york-80,2017-07-05,1,Waited more than 10 min for a cup of ice latte when no one is in front. How efficient
78,dunkin-new-york-80,2017-05-21,1,"I live on this block but have only come to this particular Dunkin 3 times-- always optimistically assuming the last experience was an unfortunate anomaly. If you're looking for a quick sugar fix, skip this Dunkin. The cashiers are rude and slow, all the while acting like you're inconveniencing them. Overall, it's too dramatic for someone who just wants to grab some quick donuts.

Today was my third visit. I ordered an ice cream sandwich but was handed just one cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top. She told me the second cookie was extra. I pointed at the picture of the ice cream sandwich clearly labeled in front of us, but she still insisted with broken logic and evasive eye contact that she would charge me extra for the second cookie.  I felt hustled and after going back and forth for a while, I started to get embarrassed for quarreling over a COOKIE, so I decided less calories was a positive I could take from this experience and left with my open-faced ice cream sandwich. 

There are two other Dunkin's down the street; they're not scrambled like this one."
78,dunkin-new-york-80,2015-12-24,5,Hey they are super friendly and they had strawberry frosted donuts ... Would have got marked down If they didn't !!!!
78,dunkin-new-york-80,2015-07-21,2,This is the worst Dunkin Doughnuts. I gave it two stars because it's Dunkin doughnuts so the products are good. But the staff is horrendous and do not want to help you. They make you feel like you're inconveniencing them by being there. Don't go here!! Avoid at all costs especially if you're interested in baskin Robbins ice cream.
78,dunkin-new-york-80,2015-07-10,1,"If you like hair in your coffee, stale donuts and a massively poor attitude from people who barely speak English, then this is your slop house!  This Dunkin', like the other one a block away, suffers from a clear lack of Health Department protocol compounded by virtually no training...and a very clear resentment of everyone.  I am starting to believe that making coffee at home is not only less costly, but also less of a headache than trying to explain to people who barely speak English what I would like for breakfast.  It's really sad to watch America Run on Rude and Dirty."
78,dunkin-new-york-80,2015-05-03,3,"Nothing special, just like most Dunkin Donuts and Baskin Robbins.  This one was pretty clean and well kept.  It's a bit cramped, only a few tables and a low counter seating area.  Food quality is what you would expect from the establishment."
79,pret-a-manger-new-york-90,2020-07-01,2,"Every sandwich is loaded with mayonnaise. Not everyone is a fan of mayo but there are no other options. Also, for the price, the sandwiches are mostly bread. Very overpriced for what you get!"
79,pret-a-manger-new-york-90,2019-10-31,3,"Leslie at this location was really nice to me today! My Pret app wasn't working because of some glitch, so she gave me my drink on the house. I also appreciated that the store manager was so present and making sure everything was fully stocked and clean. FYI, they keep the almond milk by the cashier at this Pret. 

This location doesn't have any big table options, but there are a ton of stools by the window and two-person tables stacked right next to each other. The countertop was super messy when I sat down, but by the time I left, there was someone cleaning up. 

My coffee was pretty good; I'm a sucker for their lightly roasted house brew, though it was the only option available today. Also got one of their chocolate bars and yogurts for some energy. 

Pro-tip: add some protein powder to their coffee - it makes it so tasty!"
79,pret-a-manger-new-york-90,2019-06-29,5,"Oh my gosh we loved this restaurant so much that we ate breakfast here almost every day of our stay. Good grief the Mango purée parfait thing was delicious! And the rest of my party enjoyed their breakfast sandwiches, yogurt and fruit! If there's one near you, make sure to visit Pret a Manger!"
79,pret-a-manger-new-york-90,2019-03-21,1,"If you're a fan of mango, DONT get the mango juice!  The mix with orange etc is horrible.  Had to purchase the Pomegranate white tea; which is great.  Staff did not want to exchange an opened container"
79,pret-a-manger-new-york-90,2018-09-17,1,"Today was very disappointing. I go to pret a manger quite often because I could count on the food tasting fresh and expected of a large chain. This time, I got a salmon box with spinach and quinoa. The salmon was on top so I couldnt tell how much was in there but when I opened the box I realized the salmon was the same size as a piece of sashimi. On top of that, the avocado(also the size of sashimi) was half brown! After noticing these two things the quinoa started to taste like undercooked rice. Correct this, I paid 16$ for this box and a large chai. Very disappointing"
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2019-06-12,1,"Warning, this place does not participate in the Dunkin Donut mobile payment program. There is a sign next to the register but was not very obvious.  

One word describing this place was SLOW!   

The cashier was painfully slow and the line was long. Speed was a problem in taking order and handling payments. I was here during non rush hour and couldn't imagine what the line would look like during peak commuting time. 

They must have 5-8 people behind the counter but only one person was making the drinks. The solo cashier had to fill the donut orders too.  The rest was having a good time cracking jokes and just stood around.  I waited over 10 minutes for my caramel crazy latte. Really not happy about it.  

I love Dunkin' but this is the worst. There are plenty of alternatives inside Port Authority Bus Terminal (on first floor). AVOID THIS PLACE!"
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2019-05-27,2,I too agree with other reviewer. No mobile scanner. Also no frozen coffee when I went. :(
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2019-05-14,1,"Girl behind the counter was rude, not friendly at all. 
This location doesn't take pay as you go accounts, which makes no sense , since it's an account with my own money on it. 
Needs better customer service at this facility."
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2019-01-20,1,"Not happy about my experience here today. There were at least 10 employees standing around talking and no one was taking my order (no, it was not a team meeting). I walked up to the register hoping to grab someone's attention and still nothing. Eventually the shift leader asked if my order was taken (obviously not) then the cashier began. You would think with so many people on staff that you'd be in an out...lol try again. After a good 2 to 3 minutes my order was just being prepared (there were no other orders). I waited and saw a burnt croissant come out of the toaster and the employee was about to serve that to me. I had to say something because that was unacceptable. It was switched out, then I left. If you wouldn't eat it don't serve it to others. This concludes my rant."
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2019-01-08,3,"I usually very generous about rating of my comment on Yelp. However, this time I don't think I would be generous about this Dunkin' Donut Branch. 

There is a store manager who is trying to do everything for best and better serving but, I believe that other employee who works in front of the registers aren't happy to work there they don't smile and so slow. 

Also this Dunkin' doesn't accept your perk which you cannot get your free coffee. They should upgrade their system cashier are putting your DD card number manually which is waiting for another minute."
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2018-12-24,2,"Super slow service especially considering everything here is likely in a rush to get somewhere. 

Does not have a scanner for mobile app?"
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2018-11-13,1,If I could give zero stars I would.They got my drink wrong twice and forgot to put jelly on my bagel when I asked twice . They also called me a homophobic slur and refused to change a dollar into quarters . WORST Dunkin' Donuts in nyc!!!!
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2018-10-20,1,"I decided to stop by  for a quick after work snack n wish I did not. This place is normally a madhouse anyway being in the location that it is, but today's ""show""  took the cake and will deter me from ever giving my business to this location again. I was pleasantly greated by the cashier, ordered a maple Belgium waffle sandwich a med caramel coffee and an order of donut fries, I was told by the cashier about the $2 any size coffee promotion btwn 2 to 4 and then when ordering my donut fries was informed that the donut fries are free with the purchase of my coffee....great ! 

Upon waiting I could hear back and forth bickering between the employees and who looked to be the ""manager"" they openly scolded the young man at the register and disregarded my observation of the event. The woman...FLORA...then turned around and handed me my bag sans donut fries with no explanation...when I proceeded to ask for my fries she snappingly replied ""did you pay for that"" ! I stayed calm and repeated the promotion that was said to me and again snappingly she replied ""that was last weeks promotion"" ....NEVER have I seen such blatant lack of leadership and poor customer service. so  I will finish this review with a message to FLORA- a good leader never fails to uplift and educate your team, and takes ownership over their teammates mistakes. a good leader never sacrifices good customer service. a good leader never reprimands their employees public ally or attempts to embarrass them for their own satisfaction. the proper thing to do would have been to pull him to the side after giving the customer what was offered to them, and simply correcting him to make sure the mistake did not happen again. so FLORA I hope the $2 loss you would have taken on those donut fries was well worth the $100's of dollars I have spent n would have continued to spend at this particular location ( since I'm a daily commuter) was worth it to you & D&D."
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2018-09-12,1,"I wish I could rate this store half a star. There were only three or four people ordering food. I ordered 2 jelly donuts and 1 coffee cake. Guess what? They charged me the full price but only gave me 1 jelly donut and 1 coffee cake, which I found out after I got home. Now, I really want to ask them if they just made a mistake or if they were trying to fuck with me. I don't want to write a bad review because of one missed donut, but for the ****'s sake, why can't they handle just a simple order?"
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2018-08-30,1,I frequent this location because it is close to my bus gate. I have to say that they ring you up quickly but the wait to get your food is abysmal. Today I waited 12 minutes for my food and almost missed my bus. They are very unorganized and I don't see them lasting if this keeps happening.
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2018-06-16,4,"Port Authority is a shit hole, but this Dunkin Donuts is god-sent. The location is inside the port and is literally right in front of my bus gate. There is no way I can resist. The line and staff move quick so you won't miss your ride, and they always have all the best options in stock. This place has never let me down. Donut underestimate the power of donuts."
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2017-09-02,1,"Wow, I love Dunkin' but this was a horrible experience. There are way too many people behind the counter and no one is organized. In a matter of 5 minutes being there I saw 3 orders get messed up, one of which was mine. I asked for an egg and cheese and got bacon on it, so they tried to simply take the bacon off and hand it back to me. This place needs a manager there to put things in order (I hope one was not present). 1st and last time for me."
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2017-07-15,3,"I was SUPER  excited to see that they were opening a DD here! Its in such a convenient location as I can get my coffee and breakfast fix right at the terminal. I'm a DD over Starbucks when it comes to coffee. 

When they opened I jumped right on line and that was where the disappointment kind of began. The management at this location is horrible. I thought I'd give it a few weeks as it's a new location but even then, they can't seem to get themselves organized from the ordering process to  delivering food. There seems to be no communication whatsoever behind the counter and the workers just seem really frantic and disorganized on how to process orders. 

The lines are long (as expected at a bus station) but they move so slowly. Also I noticed a sign that said they didn't participate in DD perks yet so that was disappointing as well. 

But other than that my order has always been correct and fresh and my coffees and lattes are exactly how I like them."
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2017-05-16,1,"Its hard to put into words how bad the costumer service is. Even the coffee tastes bad, which makes me think that they are not doing something right. I gave this place a try a few times.. even after it was shut down by the health board. Never again though."
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2017-04-14,1,"I stopped by this location today while exiting the Port Authority and although the donuts looked good they were stale...I picked up two on the way to work.  This in the middle of the afternoon.  I understand they may not hold up well into the evening rush but you have to wonder if they were even delivered fresh.
Even though it has an open-air concept design, it's quite hot while waiting at the register....and you will wait even if there aren't that many customers. Efficient service really is a thing of the past.
On an odd note, when calling out an order today, the counter person said ""Whose order are this?"".  On a more realistic note when the customer claimed her drink, it was made incorrectly.  That about sums it up.

Do yourself a favor....visit the DD on 39th between 7th and 8th Avenues...they have seating and their donuts are fresh and the food items are prepared to perfection...I much prefer it there and won't stray anymore."
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2017-04-13,2,"Pathetic selection of doughnuts at this location.

This is the Port Authority Bus Terminal, you can sell every kind and flavor here, but small minds means small ideas for the owners who are paying big $ for this location and only have four different flavors when I dropped by. 

Oh Krispy Kreme, Doughnut Plant, Dough. where are you"
80,dunkin-new-york-115,2017-04-07,4,"New Dunkin' Donuts at the port authority. Thur have all the regulars; coffee, donuts, bagels, snacks, and meals. The store is clean but three again it's brand new. There is no seating at this restaurant. I think the spot is really meant for the on the go commuter crowd. 

The lines for the registered are clearly labeled. This DD is located in the second floor if the south building at the port authority. 

I think all yelpers should stop in to this new location and give a review. I feel this is a good addition to the facility. So come in and get a hot coffee, a hot meal, a cold coffee, or even a cold snack!!!"
81,allegro-coffee-company-new-york,2019-10-09,4,"Located inside the enormous whole foods across from Bryant Park, this outlet for Allegro has good coffee but more often than not its very busy. Its basically a place to grab a cup of joe on the go as there is hardly any seating space. On my last visit I tried the pumpkin spice cold brew, which I believe is a fall special. Made with nitro cold brew, if had a little pumpkin kick without being overtly sweet which I enjoyed. I'm not a big fan of flavored coffee that tastes more like syrup.

Now the thing you should know is that the counter doesn't take only orders for the cafe. People can also pay for other stuff bought at the market, so there are 2 separate lines, one for under 5 items and coffee and 1 for over 5 items. Both lines can get really long! which is the only thing I don't like about this location. A couple of times now I've walked in here, seen the lines and then just gone to another spot.

Worth visiting if the lines are short but there are plenty of other cafes in the area. Additional bonus for Allegro though is that its open late, almost till 11 I believe."
82,primo-cappuccino-new-york,2019-07-16,1,"Bought a juice for $7. Watched girl use her bare hands to Handel fruit, on dirty cutting board and not wash her hands.  Walked out wo taking the juice, and didn't ask for a refund. 

Then Went to smoothie king in LIRR, down steps by bathrooms. It was so professional there."
82,primo-cappuccino-new-york,2018-09-18,4,Great place to get coffee and some food before boarding train.  I like their cookies and bakery items. Some people come in for the sandwiches.  Clean nice service.
82,primo-cappuccino-new-york,2018-05-26,1,"This was my first and last time here.  The customer ahead of me asked for a small cup of water. ""No im sorry"".   Customer said we just need a sip to take medication.  ""Another staffer said no you has to buy water"".   So he commented about that being illegal especially cause it's for a child.   She shrugged.    I commented on how sad that was.   And asked if they could use a little humanity.   She shrugged again and saw my phone and said ""you can't take photos of staff!"" So I asked for a manager.  She sent me on a wild goose chase to another store at Penn station.   Instead I will call and email their HQ office in NYC next week.   That one employee attitude cost them three sales in 3 minutes.  And IT could have been averted for one little cup of water.  This is why NYC has a lousy reputation."
82,primo-cappuccino-new-york,2017-12-18,1,"Over a dollar for almond milk? Go F yourself. It's not a premium item.

Those of us who cannot stand when little things are turned into grand endeavors for no reason whatsoever will regret walking in.

In spite of loud air ducts and music playing, I was whispered to by two employees. Learn to speak up! I guarantee they know how to be loud when hanging out with friends. With me, the only customer in the place? Self-conscious whispering. For ordering a plain small coffee. Unreal.

You know who doesn't have a problem with volume, though? The employee on break who was loudly - and most painfully to the ears - singing along to Lauryn Hill.

Getting the almond milk added to my coffee was a big old to-do as well. In what was like a silent movie - lips were moving, but I heard nothing - the girl whipped up the almond milk and put it in my drink. I would have been happier to plop some into my drink myself without all that fuss. Is this to justify a 2.20 coffee suddenly becoming 3.50 - and after I had already handed over my debit card, I might add?

As soon as you ever walk into a Primo Cappucino location they always swarm all over you like you're a vulnerable gazelle and they're piranhas in the water as you wade in. They don't even give you a chance to read or look at anything. They stare at you with blank, soulless expressions, and when they do talk, they do so in a way that you can't possibly hear them. It's needlessly inefficient...in a train station no less, where many customers are in a hurry.

Nobody seems to know what customer service is anymore. It shouldn't only be available at a restaurant where entrees are upwards of 25 dollars.  

Just a modicum of common sense would do so much good."
82,primo-cappuccino-new-york,2016-05-21,1,"They take your money, but don't serve what you pay for. I ordered a cup of coffee and was charged $6. Cappuccino is anything, but a cappuccino. Yes, you read that right. Bad business and whoever operates it is not ethical. Cashier had an attitude also. Avoid at all cost."
82,primo-cappuccino-new-york,2016-05-18,1,"Similar to a review below. Said my card was not working, so I paid with cash. Turns out, my card did work so I paid twice. Scum bags operate this place, everyone's traveling so there is no recourse. They know there is only so much length people will go for $10, so they get away with stealing."
82,primo-cappuccino-new-york,2015-03-06,1,"My latte went straight into the garbage can, once I tasted the coffee.

These people are totally incompetent at making espresso. I suppose they must use Maxwell House or Farmer Brothers beans, the stuff is total dreck. It's a sad situation when a mass-chain (Starbucks) option would be like a gourmet extravaganza compared to the local-boy disaster.

Can we please have someone who knows how to make espresso drinks in the Amtrak waiting area??"
82,primo-cappuccino-new-york,2013-10-10,1,The dunsky working the register chrged my debit card on 1 computer and said the computer wasn't working so he went to another computer and swiped my card again.  Of course I got double charged.  Be aware.
82,primo-cappuccino-new-york,2012-05-01,2,Wanted a coffee when in Penn Station. Got a Cafe Americano. Was good. Nothing special but nothing disastorous.
82,primo-cappuccino-new-york,2011-06-20,5,Ice cold beer in a wino  bag while you wait for your train.
82,primo-cappuccino-new-york,2010-04-15,2,"While Primo Cappuccino's espresso drinks are rather expensive and mediocre, it provides decent snack, beverage, and food options for travelers on the go -- all the more, since Primo has two venues about 500 feet apart (a coffee stand and a coffee shop with more food and snacks). Judging by the ubiquity of yellow Primo coffee cups scattered among morning commuters (which piqued my curiosity), Primo's strategy seems to be working well."
83,dunkin-new-york-55,2019-10-31,5,Best Dunkin store in the city! Fast service & friendly staff. Everything made how you want it.
84,dunkin-new-york-57,2020-02-22,5,"Not many ppl are aware of this place! But it's low key and has fresh donuts coffee and all the Dunkin goods!

Best part is you can ask them for extra donuts and things because they will throw out donuts at the end of the day anyways."
84,dunkin-new-york-57,2020-02-07,1,"Avoid this location!!!! Go to the one on Park Ave and 34th street instead. It's newer, cleaner, bigger, less crowded and the employees are WAY friendlier. I have had bad experiences on multiple occasions and today was the last straw. (I'll spare you the details, but all involved who I'm assuming is the manager. He is SO RUDE.) Anyway, just looking at the other reviews, I see I'm not the only one. People need to stop giving them business and then maybe they'll make a change. NEVER going to this location again!"
84,dunkin-new-york-57,2020-01-12,5,"This is my favorite location from all the ones at are next to where I live (I live next to 5). They are always so friendly and kind here. I've never felt rushed to place and order and everyone here always has a nice smile when they are taking your order.  

Great service, love the coffee, donuts are always fresh. What more can I ask for you? 

IG- @traveleen_gurl"
84,dunkin-new-york-57,2019-12-21,1,Avoided all the Starbucks in favor of Dunkin cause I usually like them better. Unfortunately both of the employees at this location spoke very little English which made it very hard to order. Once we did they got the order wrong and it was difficult and expensive to get the actual food we wanted.
84,dunkin-new-york-57,2019-10-21,1,"I love DD, but the manager in this location is really rude to customers.  He yelled at me last year and I just witnessed him yelling at another customer.  The customer was complaining about the wait (which didn't seem that long in fairness), but the manager told him to come work there if he thought he could do better.  I go daily and have seen this happen at least 5-6 times in the past few months.  Really unsettling way to start my day"
84,dunkin-new-york-57,2019-06-19,1,"I came in for a bagel and was on break from work.  I had to wait about ten minutes for two bagels. After waiting five I just asked to not have them make the product and to receive a refund. Instead of doing that, my request was not granted. I was forced to wait for a product I couldn't eat due to my time crunch. I was promised an extra bagel but I never got it.  In the future, I'd appreciate getting my stuff in a timely fashion, or simply a refund. I don't appreciate being forced to pay for bad service and on top of that for items I'm not able to enjoy."
84,dunkin-new-york-57,2018-04-09,1,Came here this morning and will not be coming back. My bagel is extremely hard but gummy at the same time... not quite stale but like almost. Thought it was just an off day but according to these other reviews this seems to be right on brand for this particular location.
84,dunkin-new-york-57,2018-02-06,1,"Such an unprofessional employees work there especially in the morning crew. They always messed up my order and today when I went there the girl who was talking my order ( don't know the name but she's the one who usually takes the order, wears hat and red shirt) was so arrogant to me when I told her please make my order like this and I asked her that why is she talking to me like this and I am just saying don't mess cuz I can't come back every time. I talked to the manager to ask him about her behavior and he came with an attitude and told me that I always complain and I asked him that every time you guys messed my order I come back and show you the tea you give me and you apologize so it's your fault and if my order is messed up ofcourse I will come back but he keep being arrogant. Even I told him that this is not the way to talk to your clients and he's like we work here for 2 years and you are telling us we don't know how to make tea. I told him I'm not saying you don't know but instead of putting cream in my tea if you put something else and on top of that you guys agree than where I am wrong. But he didn't admit and keep on being arrogant and when I asked him his name so that I can put up complain he told me what is your name let me put up complain against you but I really want management to step in and ask them that if they are messing up the order why are they expecting clients not to say anything. Everyone from my work is complaining that they always messed up the order."
84,dunkin-new-york-57,2016-08-01,1,one star only and that's cause of the nice looking woman inside that was waiting for the rain to stop . i am puzzled cause this small dd with a few tables to sit is always crowded in the morning but it's dirty and the smell of digusting body odor  is unbearable. the donuts don't look fresh at all and the folks who work here are in slow motion. i only stopped in cause my coworkers wanted ice coffee and i happen to be in the area but otherwise i will skip this place in the future or maybe i should bring some soap and a few air fresheners .
84,dunkin-new-york-57,2016-01-22,1,"I'm so disturbed by the manager at this location. I have been in here once or twice since my office in right across the street, and a lot of my co workers frequent here as well. My sweet older co worker just went in to get a cup of tea. She saw the manager who was making her drink put in water and milk before her tea bag and requested he put in the tea bag before the milk. He got so offended and rude and told her not to tell him how to make tea. Considering she is a paying customer she should decide how she wants her beverage! She asked for her money back when he wouldn't re make the tea and he told her she is banned from this location. 

She will no longer be a customer and he also lost many of my other co workers as customers as well. Get some manners please."
84,dunkin-new-york-57,2015-05-07,1,"This is the worst Dunkin Donuts I've ever been to and I'm shocked it's not already on yelp!

I'm assuming the guy who is always there is the manager, and he is awful. Also, take a shower, you STINK and everyone who comes there knows it. The entire staff is incompetent. They are ALWAYS making mistakes-- there's these 2 girls who work there that look like twins (they all look related). You'll wait forever half the time just for an iced coffee.

I stopped coming here for a while since the service is so poor, and so have many of my coworkers, but today I was really craving a coffee cake muffin and vanilla chai and it's so convenient to my office.

I asked for an iced vanilla chai. I've ordered this several times at other DD's in NYC and NJ and any other state I've been to. The male manager tells me they don't do iced chais, only hot. I said you can't just put it in a plastic cup instead with ice? Because it's warm out I don't want a hot drink. And he replies with ""no but I can give you the cup and you can do it yourself"". I said ok fine, he said ok i'll charge you 50 cents. Really? I'm already paying for the styrofoam cup--I just want the plastic one!!! Unreal. 

I digress. Never coming back."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-07-09,5,Great little cafe with friendly staff! Just had the scrambled eggs on toast with an ice coffee. They are social distancing but have a few tables outside to enjoy. Will definitely be back when I'm in the area.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-06-14,5,Love this place the food is great. Service is very friendly. Nice interiors are bright. Wonderful local place.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-05-02,5,Yummy and good quality food. Love their salads and ice coffee for lunch. One of the best for midtown and I love ordering online
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-03-25,5,"Recommend by a friend. Came here two days in a row. My buddy can't  have eggs so both days he hAd the mushroom toast. Same thing twice so...I had holy sushito and the sweet uncle Fred. I recc the sweet stuff here. I had the drip coffee but wasn't a fan (I'm not a coffee expert so what do I know) but apparently the espResso is what's good I guess? Australia themed. Be prepared to get food to go, only place for like 5 groups. Chill waitstaff"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-03-10,5,"Walked by this cafe on the way to work one morning and decided to sit down and have breakfast, so glad I did! While it is a small place my almond milk flat white was amazing. Definitely one of the best flat white coffees I've had. I also tried the muse which was also very good which consisted of muesli, sweet, with jam, a lot of fresh fruit, and very filling.

Service was excellent.

I will definitely be back for more."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-03-07,4,"I agree with the many reviews on the wonderful coffee there.  I got a mocha, and it was one of the best I had ever had.  As for food, I got their ""big dill"".  It was very good.  Portion is generous.  It gets crowded fast!  Go right at the opening if you want breakfast there."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-03-02,5,The BEST salad I have ever had. On whim I felt like having a healthy salad and fount Little Collins on Yelp. I ordered the kale/quinoa/chicken salad and it was amazing. The chicken was very flavorful along with the crunchy quinoa this salad had it all. It was a gorgeous day in the city and I took my salad to Central Park and my lunch hour couldn't have been more perfect.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-03-01,3,It's really little! Very crowded hard to get a table. Food was ok. Servers were nice. Just too little space to stand and eat! Won't be going back
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-02-29,4,"Really nice and delicious little coffee place. Great food, great coffee and teas. The only thing that I didn't like was that it's really really small place to be."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-02-20,4,"{Overall: 4; Coffee: 5; Food: 4} Atmosphere: 3.5 (because of the crowds); Service: 4

It's a small coffee shop and has seats, but definitely gets crowded especially on a weekend around brunch time - you'll probably be fighting for a place, and you'll feel a little crowded in when you get one. Lots of people standing around. Service is good in spite of the tight quarters.

Delicious Counter Culture coffee. Good Australian brunch staples. 

Would return for coffee in the future."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-02-19,4,"Hmmm so so good. I stopped in to Little Collins this morning (Wednesday) because I've been dying to try it for a while now. I figured a weekday morning would be a great time to come to avoid the crowds. I was so wrong. It was packed around 10:30am. I managed to grab a seat by the window. Granted, the seating options are very limited which I think is my only complaint of this place. The staff was very friendly and remembered my name even when I left. I got a flat white and the sweet uncle Fred. They both came out very quickly. The flat white was delicious. I ordered the sweet uncle Fred because I've noticed that a lot of cute cafes around the city have bomb banana bread and I've been on the hunt for the best one. This one definitely measures up! It is topped with ricotta, berries, honey and almond brittle. The banana bread itself is so delicious - not too dense and just sweet enough. The ricotta on top was an amazing addition and a great complement. I think this one is going to the top of my list! Great experience overall!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-02-19,5,"The best coffee I've had in NYC so far.
The owner was so kind, polite and genuine to all he engaged with. 
Really enjoyed this place (not just because it reminds me of my place back home near Little Collins st, Melbourne).
I will be back!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-02-18,2,"So I received a luke warm cappuccino.  I brought it back to the counter and told the person.  She said ""so you want a really, really hot one""? I said, I want a hot cappuccino, really really hot is OK too.  How annoying, a defensive counter person over coffee temperature.  They remade it and it was the same luke warm.  I did not say anything else.

The entree I ordered was excellent."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-02-09,2,"Good coffee but boy they dont make you feel welcome! Its rush rush get your drink
And leave."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-02-03,4,"For coffee an absolute yes!!! For food... I don't think so. 

I tried their macchiato and a pour over coffee, both  really good. Can def recommend this place for espresso and coffee  lovers.

The food, I guess, is just not my cup of tea. It's cooked well, but the taste is too weird. It looks better than it tastes."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-02-01,4,"Delicious flat whites, strong coffee and delicious oatmilk. I was in and out so didn't try any of the eats, but I noted some vegan options that were different sounding. 

This place was busy - not much seating space and the line can be a bit tricky (it's difficult to tell who is in line and who isn't), but overall it's a friendly and welcoming place serving up a solid and cute cup of coffee."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-01-30,5,"Balance is a beautiful thing and extremely difficult to get right. The balance of ingredients to create one of the most perfect lattes in the world is even more of a feat and a true achievement. 

Coming from the San Francisco of Australia, Little Collins is much more than cool, hipster or trendy. It's cozy, small and dedicated to creating perfection from  every ingredient on the small menu. The lattes are not overpowering, but also not bland. They are  simply delicious with a profile of spice, fresh coffee and milk. The service is quick and tactical, getting people what they need quickly without any sideline conversations. There are no distractions to annoy an uncaffinated soul and a focus on producing some of thr best cofffee drinks that money can buy. The pastries that are here are very well made and the entire experience is quick, yet memorable."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-01-24,4,"The service was really good, you did not have to wait too long for your food (albeit, it takes time to make food). The baristas were awesome and friendly, and made sure you were satisfied with your order. However, it's best to plan ahead if you are visiting this quaint little nook. Being smack-dab in the middle if midtown, it's a nightmare during rush hour because it's a very small space. Often hard to stand around, but otherwise if you want a grab a quick coffee/lunch to-do, it would be good."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-01-23,5,Our go to coffee while staying in New York. We were lucky to have an 'Urban space' building across the road from our hotel in Lexington Ave where Little Collins Coffee was. Being spoiled with our coffee in Australia we couldn't fault our Lattes - excellent! Highly recommended  to others.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-01-21,4,"We enjoyed our first meal of 2020 at Little Collins. We called ahead to make sure they were open, and they said they were serving the brunch menu that day for New Year's Day. I was expecting more of a sit-down place with more seating, so I was surprised to see that Little Collins is TINY! There is really limited seating. You order at the counter, then fend for yourself if you specified ""dine-in."" We optimistically thought there was a system and that perhaps the staff would assist with seating or stagger orders. I snagged a seat at the counter, and we were never able to get a table or another seat for my husband, so he stood the whole meal. 

Despite that, the food was excellent, and the staff were very friendly. We enjoyed chatting with one of the employees about Chicago (where we are from) since she had visited a friend there recently. We ordered the avocado toast and sweet uncle Fred (banana bread with ricotta, berries, honey). Both were amazing, but the banana bread was my absolute favorite. So sweet and flavorful! We saw on the menu that this is an Australian spot with different ""brekkie"" options. If this is traditional Australian food, then I need to visit! I loved the food. I love the people there. I love the energy. (I just wish it were bigger!) Next time, I would try to visit at less of a prime time so I could have regular seating to enjoy my meal more."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-01-19,5,Delicious coffee- appreciate can get in a glass rather than single use cup. Food is pretty and yummy! Limited seating. Usually busy.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-01-06,4,Tasty food and good coffee.  It gets very busy on weekends so I don't recommend going with a large group.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-01-06,4,"Little Collins was so NYC, it almost hurt. The service was not very friendly or patient, but neither is the rest of New York. The seating space is very limited and tight. I was alone and could barely find place to stand, let alone eat.

I ordered the avocado toast, which definitely needed to be eaten with a fork and knife. It was piled HIGH with avocado, sprinkled with feta and tasty to the max. Unfortunately, every time I tried to saw a piece off, I'd bump elbows into someone else. The food and coffee were both REALLY good, but I would definitely recommend taking it to go.

I read reviews of the olive oil cake, so I had to have it. Unfortunately, iot was just oooookay. Tasted mostly like bread and cardamom. I wish I would have gotten one of the beautiful chocolate chip cookies in the case instead!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-01-05,4,"With an explosion of Aussie coffee joints, this tight little spot in upper east/ midtown stands out. It's got everything you need in a good cafe: flat whites and avocado toast. But it amps it up with other delectable menu items and an exciting bustling NYC vibe. We try to make it here any time we are nearby."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-01-04,5,"This is my ""go-to"" place for avocado toast and breakfast! It is just a block from our midtown home, so i have been many, many times."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2020-01-02,3,"Doesn't look much when you walk by.....keep it moving is my recommendation. I tried the SWEET UNCLE FRED (banana bread, ricotta, berries, honey), and it was OK. I heard the PICK ME UP
sandwich (eggs, tomatoes, onions) was better. But none of these blew me away, nor were they worth the price. We ate these sandwiches casually by the counter (no seats available, as it is a very small place). Pass."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-12-26,4,"Adorable cafe with delicious shakshuka and poached eggs. We lucked out by getting the 3 seats by the window but if you don't get them, it's basically standing room only. This cafe is great but pretty tiny, I could imagine a line out the door for it on most weekends!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-12-26,5,"Very good. All the personnel were excellent.  Food awesome. My wife and I very pleased with service, ambience and food."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-12-16,5,My husband and I travel a lot and each city we visit we always find a local coffee shop. I must say Little Collins is my new favorite place. The coffee is amazing and the food is fantastic! We were in the city for 5 days and we had breakfast there 4 days. (Would've been 5 but we went to another coffee shop on the first day) We are latte snobs and I can promise you they have great lattes. We will for sure be back!
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-12-14,5,"I'm giving this place 5 stars because of how amazing the food is. The sitting situation would be a 1 Star. But no matter how shitty the sitting situation is, I will ALWAYS go back. The food was fricken amazing. The waitress, I dk her name, but she had teal hair was sooo nice and kind to me. I asked her a lot of questions and she was very patient with me even though there was a huge line behind me."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-12-10,4,"Packed and expensive. The food was delicious, but felt a little overhyped. But that is weekend brunch ."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-12-01,5,"Outstanding coffee!  The place is small, and extremely crowded. Be prepared to wait, and shuffle around waiting for space. However, it is definitely worth the wait for an astounding cup of coffee."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-12-01,4,"Yummy, but tiny, shop on Lex. There was a quick moving line for both tables and orders. We were eating in and were lucky to get a comfy spot in the middle of the shop. We got the Smash avocado toast and the Big Dill salmon sandwich. Both were tasty, nicely seasoned, and looked pretty, too. It filled us up for not that much cash considering it tasted like quality ingredients. The workers were friendly and quick."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-11-30,4,"the service here from everyone was good. they all had smile on their faces and the latte makers looked focused making the art haha. the food came out extremely quick despite how busy they were!

i ordered uncle fred and i expected nothing less. it was a banana bread with a few toppings. i personally thought it was too sweet. i didn't think it had a good balance but i knew what i was signing up for lol. the almond brittle was amazing! we also ordered the chorizo baked eggs. that was so good with a nice spice kick to it. we thought the acidity was a little much but overall, amazing dish. cafe mocha was the best we've ever had. nice amount of chocolate and was creamy. 

overall i'd definitely recommend this place. it's really packed when it's busy because it's a smaller place, but i think it's worth it."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-11-29,5,Great coffee!! A cute neighborhood shop. Gets busy at times so don't go here if you are in a rush!!
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-11-20,5,Absolutely loved this little coffee/cafe. It had such a warm and inviting ambiance. It seems to be a loved spot by many as it was filled with people throughout my time there. I had their mocha with oat milk and it was to die for. You can tell they put a lot of effort into the quality of their products. For breakfast I had the Sweet Uncle Fred which again was nothing short of amazing. I would totally recommend this place for a little escape from the chilly New York streets!
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-11-15,5,"Literally the best breakfast I've ever had working on the upper east side in the past 5 years!!!!! From the above and beyond service, to the speed at which the food was delivered, to the actual quality of this fantastic smashed avo toast with feta and scrambled eggs (made just how my bf makes them) I will definitely be coming back, and bringing my boyfriend with me"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-11-07,3,"Delicious drip coffee and charcoal chicken sandwich. The cafe was cute, but very crowded and loud around lunch time. I'll probably take my order to-go next time."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-11-02,4,"This is a great spot. It's a bit hectic at peak hours, but the food is always good, and the ""work breakfast"" items are amongst the best of the ""to go"" spots in Midtown East."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-11-01,3,"Their coffee and food may be cute, but the vibe in here is anything but. The space is packed and feels more like the hunger games than a place to meet a friend over coffee or have a meaningful conversation. Be prepared to be stabbed for a seat at a table."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-10-29,5,Some of the best coffee in midtown. This Australia spot is good for coffee and sandwiches. Really tight inside so don't expect a seat. Service is quick and their own blend of beans from counter culture is good.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-10-26,5,"A great little cafe for both food and coffee - a little nondescript on the outside, the only way to tell what you're getting into is the regular flow of customers that often turns into a bit of a crowd inside and of course the Yelp reviews. I came here for breakfast twice and was impressed by the food. 

The Smash (their version of avocado toast) hit the spot - definitely the kind that needs to be eaten with a fork and knife since the avocado was piled high. For those of you who are feta tolerators as opposed to feta lovers, don't worry - there was just enough to add flavor without being overwhelming. Also tried a flat white but it was slightly too bitter for my taste.

Also tried the Sweet Uncle Fred, which I thoroughly enjoyed (keep in mind, though, that I have a serious sweet tooth). Loved the combination of ricotta cheese, fresh berries, and almond toffee. The sweetness of the honey put it a little over the edge - I thought if they used slightly spicy honey like I had at Ippudo the other night that might be perfect. Ordered a latte this time and was happier with the taste.

Both times I came before 8:30 and was lucky to get a tiny table (this is definitely not a place for large groups), and both times it was insanely crowded by the time I left and people were swooping in on my table."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-10-12,5,"Great place for a unique culinary experience at a reasonable price.  I got breakfast here, The sweet uncle fred and the pick me up.  Loved the caramelized onions on the pick me up and the sweet uncle fred was the perfect balance of sweet (banana bread and honey), creamy (mascarpone cheese), crunchy (toffee/brittle sprinkles) and fresh (strawberries, blueberries and blackberries).

Service was friendly and fast so remember to tip!  You can dine in but space is limited. I took mine to go."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-10-10,4,"Wanted a quick light bite to eat for lunch when I was visiting the city.  Came across this place and decided to try it.  Its a cute little cafe far from anything touristy (which is what I wanted).  Not a lot of seats but we surprisingly didn't have trouble finding a table.  There was only 2 of us.  For larger parties it would have been much more difficult.

This cafe is Australian style with a lot of their typical dishes.  I got he schnitzel and my friend got the smash.  Both were good - I wouldn't say amazing though.  They don't allow for any substitutions/changes which was a little annoying but I'm assuming its because its a small place. 

Overall, food was good, prices were reasonable.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here but if I was in a bind I might."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-10-09,5,I always avoided this small coffee shop bc it was always packed...I understand now for a reason. Very friendly and helpful staff and the food was really good. The schnitz and bitz was big enough for 2 and delicious...and I'm very critical :-)
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-10-08,5,"Small and crowded place, it is hard to find a empty table, but the coffee and the food is really good, it worth it to wait a little bit or eat being standing, the coffee is good, I had the sweet uncle fred, something different from the rest of the places, it was super good!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-10-08,5,"Adorable Australian spot putting out delicious coffee (flat whites are particularly great) and fantastic items for brekkie.  I have a hard time not ordering the smash (avocado and feta bedazzled with pepitas and red pepper flakes), but one of these days I'll branch out.  The avocado deliciousness is loaded on greater than an inch which just the right amount of kick.  Snagging a seat inside is difficult, but sometimes the stars align and you can enjoy your items inside.  Some may call it cramped, I call it cozy."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-10-07,5,I'm from out of town and looked on Yelp to find a vegetarian breakfast.  I knew I was in the right place when I walked in and it was packed!  I had the Pick Me Up and it was really tasty.  I would definitely recommend this!
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-10-03,4,"Really crammed inside but really good food. It is probably one of the best options for breakfast mid-town where there aren't a lot of quality options. 
THE MUZE (bircher muesli with cinnamon house made jam & fresh berries) was delicious! It was super creamy yogurt with soft oats folded in and topped with fresh blackberries. I have since started adding oats to yogurt the night before to try to recreate the texture (I'm getting there...)
The Avocado smash was also really good and everything you'd want in avocado toast."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-29,5,We came here for breakfast prior to leaving for the airport. Service was great and the food was delicious. I ordered the smash. My sister's order the pbj and the banana bread.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-28,1,"Disappointed about this spot. If you are vegetarian, substitutions for meat that is already included in the dish price will cost you extra. A meal that costs the business less to make, will cost you more."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-27,5,I made my husband walk PRETTY far - with no caffeine in either of our systems for this experience. Service was amazing - store was packed - coffee and mocha were delicious. We also got these little fruit muffins?? Pastries??? Some sort of delicious baked good. Definitely worth the walk.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-25,2,"The place is indeed small, but that's not a problem. Prices are high, probably, due to high demand, but the food wasn't good at all. I ordered avocado eggs benedict, the avocado mash was too salty -- it really left bad taste in my mouth. Benedict lacked hollandaise sauce, there were just poached eggs with salmon and toasts on the side. Any average hotel makes better Eggs Benedict."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-24,2,"Really wanted to like this place because of the great reviews. Its not easy to find a place that serves egg sandwiches past 10:30 so I went for lunch. I ordered a Big Dill and it was sooooooo greasy. It would've been great had it not been so greasy, but now I'm at work with a stomach ache.

Maybe I'll give it another go in the future - other pictures of the Big Dill look less soaked than mine."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-21,5,"This place is a little gem  in the middle of magnificent city ""The Big Apple"".
Been here twice so glad it is very close to my apartment. 

I'll make it short and simple and just call it as it is. Great food and great service!!! Excellent!!!

Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

Just FYI, space is very limited such a tiny place. 
Take out is always an option though."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-18,5,"I came here for the first time a couple days ago to pick up coffee and breakfast for work and it really exceeded my expectations. I was in a hurry to order, so I just decided to pick one and got the Sweet Uncle Fred. I'm usually not the type to eat a super sweet breakfast, but this was so delicious. The fruit, banana bread, and frosting all went together really well and weren't painfully sweet. It seemed like it would be too small for a meal, but in the end it was quite filling."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-17,5,I love this place. Best espresso and coffee I've had in NY so far. I've never eaten any but the food looks good too.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-13,2,"I sought to replace one ingredient with another and wasn't told before paying that it would add a significant charge. In all, my sandwich was a few cents short of $20. My mediocre, under-toasted sandwich."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-10,4,Stopped in for breakfast and loved the food and coffee! I had to wait awhile to sit and others were also standing with their food. I would recommend going at off hours.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-08,5,Their food is amazing!!! We always get it delivered to work. They are quick to deliver and are accommodating to our alteration requests of the menu due to dietary restrictions. Love their food! Thank you!
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-07,4,"Great value for money amazing coffee, very unique tasting coffee but the quality is phenomenal and very smooth. Also the cookie and breakfast entrées are excellent. Breakfast entrées would include meat-based wraps and egg base wraps definitely worth considering. Very heavy and very filling. Great way to start the day. Best of all those the coffee it's very smooth and very well done. Very authentic Australia as well."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-09-01,2,"The food was good but the service was really bad. They don't have a waiting system and have a first come first serve so if 20 people are waiting and someone new enters and a table opens up, they can take the table without any consideration for the people waiting. This is what happened with me and when I bought it up to the staff, they said since they don't have a line system it's my fault for not jumping ahead and grabbing the table. The restaurant doesn't have consideration for people's time. Every restaurant in the world follows a line system so I don't know what's so hard about that. Will not be coming again."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-08-31,5,Highly recommend iced coffee and Greek salad! Often crowded at lunch time but service usually quick!
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-08-25,5,"Walking in, I was overwhelmed with the number of people in such a small place so I admittedly walked out thinking I would revisit my decision to try another coffee shop. Boy am I glad, I walked around for a bit and decided to try again. Yes, the shop is small and yes there is barely any seating area but baristas were so friendly amidst the crazy busy morning (which apparently is the norm here). Once I ordered my Flat White and The Sweet Uncle Fred, the server helped to assist me in finding a seat. Omg best banana bread ever! It was nutty and not too sweet with the ricotta topping and the praline was just perfect on it. The flat white was so yummy! I enjoyed every drop of it. Price for a Floridian was pretty pricey for coffee and a ""snack"" but the quality was well worth it. Definitely worth the experience."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-08-18,1,"Eat at your own risk! They no longer make the best avocado toast! It now consists of watered down and bitter guacamole. Whatever tiny amount of avocado on the toast tasted spoiled and clearly unripe. The whole thing even smells acidic. On a positive note, eating their avocado toast is a great appetite suppressant. Good luck eating there"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-08-15,5,"The coffee was great, the hot chocolate was great, the avocado toast was great, and service was so friendly and helpful. A wonderful experience."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-08-15,5,"Stopped in this morning for a latte and grabbed an apple oat muffin as well. Both delicious, in fact was the best coffee I've had in NYC. Please please open Midtown West location. It's definitely small and crowded, but I typically grab my coffee on the run so it works for me. Did I mention Midtown West ... ??"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-08-11,5,Adorable place. Super small but cozy. Food is fresh and delicious! Good coffee. Nice service. Reasonable prices. Will def come back.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-08-07,5,"Okay for me this was by far my favorite place to eat! Just look at the photos mouth watering when you are taking it in visually and the taste does not let you down. Toast, fresh avocado, feta cheese, chili flakes and a fried egg on top!!!! Very busy coffee shop with different delights from breakfast to sweet. Lots of different coffees and a fun staff! Again great local crowd with its regulars.  A must try Do It!!!!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-08-05,4,"[Bottom line] Fresh ingredients cooked well, but feels a bit overpriced and not ideal for a relaxed eat-in.
[What to get] For a quick savory bite, *the Big Dill* is yummy and filling - bread is soft and toasted perfectly, while egg (infused with dill) is fluffy and fragrant. Wish it had less scallion and more dill and chives! Overall the flavors were understated."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-08-04,5,"We really enjoyed their avocado toast, coffee is good too, we had a latte and a cold brew"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-08-01,3,Somewhat underwhelmed by this tiny place with people mulling about praying that one of the ten seats available will open up. I thought it was good but not good enough to have to stand up and eat and or mill about. We had the avocado toast with lox and it was adequate but nothing to be over the moon about in my opinion. Also tried the other location in the food court down the street. Was nice that they had a true Aussie boy working there since it is an Australian chain.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-30,5,"Little Collins is a little gem in the chaos of midtown. During my visit to the shop, I had a wonderful breakfast sandwich (the Big Dill) and the best latte I've had in years. In addition to the delicious meal, it was heartening to see how much the employees enjoyed working with one another. I have already recommended this place to friends and will continue to do so."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-30,5,"Best coffee I have ever had in NYC. Got there by 9 am on a Saturday and was able to find a seat and was served quickly. Food was good- bacon ok- salmon- great! French Toast looked better than it tasted, but was still better than most breakfast options in Manhattan. Great little place- try takeout if there's no available seating!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-28,5,"Coffee made right.  The coffee shop was extremely busy but yet the staff was friendly, even though we  asked a lot of questions.  We ordered piccolo latte, a cold brew and a pull over.  The cold brew was alright but pull over and piccolo latte were superb."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-24,5,The space is a bit small but the food is good. They're self serve and the food comes out quickly. The big dill was the better dish over the smash. It doesn't specify on the menu but you can add eggs to the smash. I recommend for a quick brunch bite.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-24,4,"Little collins

UPDATE: taking a star off do to rude barista.

Experience 
1. Asked barista (military cut man) about their cold brew coffee and if they had iced coffee. He said they only have cold brew. I then asked for a sample, and he seemed unhappy about my request.

2. Ordered a cold brew au lait with almond milk.

Result
1. He returned by chucking a shot glass at me, filled with about 1cm of cold brew coffee, on the table for me to sample. This behavior was rude and unprofessional. It gets better, he poured the tiniest amount ever to sample. Most shops offer a half to a full shot glass to sample. It was obvious this barista was annoyed about giving me a sample and I have no idea why? 

2. The cold brew sample was very good compared to others out there. Close to the all around flavor of a hot brew and not too flat like other cold brews. With a splash of  almond milk, it was a even better.

Recommendations: to the military cut man
1. Be professional when providing a customer with a sample. What ever personal feelings or restrictions you have about providing samples, get over it! Its just coffee dude! I usually tip after a sample but my wife, who witnessed the whole thing, refused.

85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-22,4,"The expression ""victim of their own success"" springs to mind. 

Aussie-ish coffee shop around midtown East with very limited seating. First off the coffee is very good, and ultimately that's the key litmus test for a coffee shop. Ordered a soy flat white and a cold brew. Steamed dairy alternatives are a bit hit and miss with coffee shops - they can come out a bit...off, but this one was nicely done. The cold brew was smooth without any of the bitterness that the hipster places seem to cultivate. 

Product quality to one side, heading there on a weekend unless it's the arse crack of dawn is a fairly chaotic experience. If you're hoping to take refuge from the heat and enjoy some AC I'd go elsewhere similarly if you have a stroller in toe it's not gonna be a fun experience. The 2 times I've been here on weekends it's like the fall of rome - servers whizzing around bringing people coffee waiting by the door; brave customers perched on a ledge near the tills eating their avo toast / granola; and a drawn out game of hopscotch while waiting for your coffee order dodging incoming/outgoing clientele.

If they just want to be a quick stop off spot for coffee then the current premises are sufficient but if they want to have brunch offerings then they need to expand to a similar size to some of the bluestones/taylor streets."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-15,4,Great coffee! Crazy crowded! Don't go during rush hours or lunch. Definitely not quiet but super good!
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-11,3,"The food was good I had the avocado toast and a cappuccino.  However when I came in, I was just looking around , hello I am from Boston I never been in here and instead of getting, a good morning,how  can I help you ? . I got a what are you looking for ? I know that people in NYC are known for at times being rude, but in a restaurant costumer service should always be a high standard."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-10,4,"The food is good, but too tiny to sit in. 
Ordered the smash and waffle with berries. Very good."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-06,4,"Cute little coffee shop with a lovely decor. I ordered a latte with almond milk and an avocado toast - both arrived in about 10 minutes. Service was good with dropping off water and clearing plates. Negatives are the spacing- very crowded, small tables, not good for anything more than groups of 2 or a quick grab and go. One thing to note is that they don't advertise having oat milk but do have it - which we were bummed to discover after the fact."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-04,4,"Great little place to get brekkie, brunch, or just coffee while taking in some Aussie spirit. I adore all things Australian, so walking into Little Collins filled me with warm and fuzzy feelings. That street sign! The delicious coffee! The Vegemite! ... Scratch that, Vegemite is never a good thing. 

This cafe is narrow and small, with room for about twelve seats. Prepare to wait for a table if you come between 11-2. It did feel uncomfortably tight in there while waiting to get situated. Service is standard, and so is the menu. Lots of sandwiches, salads, and avocado. I got a coffee with almond milk and a Greek salad. Both were great. The salad came with a block of feta cheese, bread, and a light dressing. It's big enough to share.

The coffee is up to par with Australian coffee. I wish they did free refills! I really enjoyed it. 

Prices are very reasonable for the food, but beverages were definitely higher than average."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-02,4,Fun ambience. Kind waitstaff. Good coffee. Even better Big Dill breakfast sandwich. Definitely mind the pace of people eating if you're looking to stay for your meal; takeout may be the best bet due to cramped but cozy quarters.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-07-02,1,"As somebody from Melbourne, I found this really disappointing. Service was awful, they just didn't care and ignored us. Food is also very average.... would not recommend!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-06-27,5,"I came here on a hot, sweltering day in Manhattan in search of a cold brew to 1) cool me off 2) wake me up after my food coma from lunch. This coffee shop was able to deliver. I loved the taste of my cold brew - it really hit the spot. The taste was very smooth - so delicious!

Music was bumpin', and when you walk inside, you instantly feel cooler (in temperature, and in social status). The service was a little absent-minded, but speedy. I didn't get any food here, but the pictures and what everyone ordered around me looked amazing. $13 sandwiches though...kind of pricy, but perhaps worth it? 

Only next time will tell."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-06-20,4,Cute little spot to get a quick bite for breakfast. We had The Big Dill and The Smash. Both dishes were delicious and good sized portions. The avocado was super fresh in The Smash and the combination of the dill with the eggs and salmon in The Big Dill was a nice touch. Besides their regular menu you can get croissants or plain banana bread if you want to grab something and go on your way to work.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-06-17,5,"My Aussie friends had directed me to go to this cafe. I love the coffee from Australia so I was really excited to try it. Of course, we ended up getting flat whites and it was amazing!! It was a small, tight space so we took the coffee to go. I would definitely come back again & wouldn't mind trying the food."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-06-13,4,"Service was good! We really enjoyed the drip coffee. The food has lots of bread, but that's not always a bad thing; just avoid certain items if you're trying to stay healthy. The avocado toast was great, and the fruits were very fresh! The eggs weren't all too bad. We didn't enjoy the fact that their was no ketchup. Cute little space on Lexington, you will enjoy if you like rustic spots. Customer service was better than most joints in the area!!!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-06-09,5,The smash is pretty good. The avocado is thick and creamy. I like the banana bread in the sweet uncle Fred. It's not too sweet and it has plenty of walnuts in it. The moca is smooth and not too sweet. The food in general is pretty good. Just it's a small place and not too many seating.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-06-08,4,Be warned about going during rush hour. Came here with my husband around 10 and it was still crazy busy. But the staff worked really well to make the wait as short as possible. Good coffee with good food. We both enjoyed delicious pour over coffees (as always a pour over takes time to make) and egg sandwiches. Perfect place to sit down and eat your breakfast but also get back to your day quickly.
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-06-07,4,"Yummy yummy food, however it was packed and there was very little seating. I almost left because of the crowd!! The baristas were fantastic and the food spoke for itself. The atmosphere was also very clean and trendy--definitely an instagramable spot."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-06-06,3,"As Melbournites we thought it would be cute to visit this new coffee shop in NYC, while on our way to MOMA. We timed our arrival well as the queue was minimal. We both ate in. I had the charcoal chook and my wife the chicken schnitzel. The rolls they were on were both crispy and soft and moist. They also had the right amount of dressing for my taste as I hate sandwiches drowned in sauces. I finished my meal off with an espresso and an oatmeal cookie. The cookie was great, but I'm pretty sure ANZAC biscuits have only 4 ingredients and hazelnuts or maple syrup are not either of them. Still it was a good quick fast lunch."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-06-04,5,"I would definitely recommend The smash which is an avocado toast with feta cheese inside and pumpkin seeds, a little bit spicy. It was literally awesome! I had a latte as well. It was so delicious. I would definitely recommend this place for coffee or breakfast!! 
And also The staff are so welcoming and friendly. I loved it!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-05-25,5,"Cute little place with great coffee and good dishes. Fresh, well flavoured and appropriately spiced."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-05-22,2,"I really wanted to like Little Collins. The shop is close to my workplace so it would have been a great lunch option. However, I thought that the food was overpriced for what it was and I also found a hair in my panna cotta. The panna cotta was in an enclosed container and the hair was actually set in the panna cotta which makes me feel like the food prep may be a little lacking in hygiene.

I've been to the restaurant twice and appreciate that they have vegetarian options. I think that the food is okay but the sandwich and the panna cotta ran me more than $22 which is expensive especially since both items are pretty small."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-05-22,5,"Finally! Little Collins has exceptional coffee with friendly staff. It's a very small but cute shop. We've been searching NYC for a place like this for over a month. 

This is the spot!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-05-18,5,"Busy little breakfast place, great coffee, delicious breakfast portions from avocado smash to ""the muse"" breakfast porridge."
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-05-10,5,"Best sandwiches ever!! Amazing service!!
Great coffee, you can definitely feel how fresh the ingredients are. 
Highly recommended!"
85,little-collins-new-york-3,2019-05-02,5,"Simple, good coffee, fantastic brunch! We had the Smash with scrambled and bacon. Will recommend this for everyone!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2020-05-06,3,The coffee is good. They have very small sizes but is NY so I don't expect less. I just don't like the customer service. They seem so disconnected and unhappy it goes with their location theme down and under.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2020-02-16,4,"I love the quality of the coffee here. Always fresh and always brewed perfectly. The design of the shop and the music really makes the place stand out amongst other shops. The only issue I have with this specific location in Hell's Kitchen is that it seems even on the busiest of days and hours, there's only one barista working. There's constantly a line out the door because of this, and it takes a very long time to order and then get your drink. I don't know if it's a money-saving issue of paying employees or if that's just a decision by the owner to only have one person working, but it has deterred me and several other coffee lovers in the area from coming back. Also, I witnessed a homeless person literally accost a barista and then sit and smoke outside the shop until I physically removed him from the area. It's not safe to only have one employee working at a time. Safety for employees and customers should be a priority, and so should efficient service. All baristas are super nice and experienced, but the long lines and waiting over 20 minutes for a drink simply isn't acceptable. Thank you for reading and hope to come back if/when things change."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2020-02-02,3,"Let me say, I go here  a LOT. The coffee is great and I've become good friends with some of the girls there. But today, Feb 2nd at 11:15am will  be my last time. I ordered my normal, a flat white with almond milk. The cup isn't even half way full. What a rip off and the girls working didn't even care and just went back to eating their snacks and bring on their phone."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-12-18,3,"Cute spot to grab a coffee in the very busy and expensive area of Times Square.  I ordered a flat white both times and it was good, but pretty small for $5.25.  I guess it's the area.  Good, prompt service and way better quality than you'd find at hotel coffee shops in the area. It's basement level so you have to walk downstairs from the sidewalk.  Next to a barber shop, you can't miss it."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-11-26,5,"Cortados and Piccolos-

Thank you for your thoughtful response (I've since deleted my initial review).  I really thought my drink tasted more like a short shot, but perhaps that was the power of persuasion coupled with my frustration after walking a few blocks to St. Kilda for a better coffee.  

I am in NYC every year, but due to conferences, have to stay near Times Square.  Finding good food in such a touristy area is challenging.  There is little doubt, you guys had the best espresso I could find for many, many blocks."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-11-22,5,"As my mom would say, this spot is a hidden gem. Their coffee is excellent, and they have a nice selection of treats for a midday pick-me-up (loving the pumpkin bread!). It's more of a grab-and-go place than a cafe you could hang around in all day, but there are a few seats."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-11-06,2,"Coffee is fine. The space is nice albeit small. My main concern were the workers. I found them to be unfriendly and unresponsive. Obviously I'm giving the benefit of the doubt, but it's not a very welcoming vibe I'd go back to anytime soon."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-09-16,3,"Delicious coffee + tea, but really small space with no AC. Also none of the chairs have backs which is like...why?? Not very comfortable to sit down and enjoy a cup, but great to take away."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-09-05,2,"Fluorescent lit basement ambiance

Coffee is good. Ordered coffee at 745pm and was told they were locking up despite the fact that their closing time is 800pm. $5 expensive coffee where they rush you out the door"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-08-21,3,"I've had way better for less. It tastes ok. Personally, I like Khave and Bibble and Sips coffee better in the City. I like that they have almond milk. The baristas were very nice. I didn't like how I had a hard time putting the lid on the large cup lol. They don't have personalized items. Way to save $$$, St Kilda. I won't return."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-08-17,5,"Very cute spot, simple menu but very delicious and smooth coffee blends. The barista is great, aside from the no air conditioning the place is very quaint. The outdoor seating is also perfect with graffiti. Recommend: lemon poppy loaf and the cold brew (might be best I've ever had)"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-08-04,1,"Used to love this quiet spot and recommended it often. Went there last week and they are credit cards only.  

Never again. 

A company that wants my business but makes it harder for me to patronize them is not good customer service. Period. Especially when they are higher priced than the myriad of other coffee spots within spitting distance."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-08-03,5,Coffee is so good and in a convenient location. Nice place to go downstairs and get away from the hustle and bustle for a minute. Service was friendly as well. Will definitely be back.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-08-01,5,"Amazing place, couldn't have found it without yelp! Love it!!! Great coffee
They also offer hemp milk"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-06-26,4,My go to place for coffee when I'm staying in Times Square. No frills just great coffee at a great price.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-06-16,4,"I love this cute little coffee shop--they are always super friendly and the drinks come out pretty quickly.

The seating here is a bit limited, but I actually love sitting right outside on one of the benches if it's available.

Their iced chai has great flavor and really does the trick.

Definitely one of the better spots for coffee in the area."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-05-13,3,"Cute little below street level. I had coffee and a vegan chocolate chip cookie. Very good I might add.
My only complaint is that the coffee was not hot. I did have 1/2 and 1/2 added, so that might have lowered the tempeture some, but it still should have been hotter."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-04-30,5,Great coffee and pastries. Seating was limited but well worth it.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-04-12,5,Wonderful Coffee. Great staff. Nice seating area. We bought cappucino and Latte. Both were good. Welcoming staff. Friendly.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-04-06,4,"A pleasant experience.
Cold brew tastes great even without cream and sugar.
Chai is light.
Macchiato is served with a cream flower :)
Pastries are from multiple bakeries all over town.
Every coffee shop can't also be a bakery, after all."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-04-02,5,"So far my best cup of coffee in NYC. Smooth not bitter, just what I needed. Funky little below grade shop was very nice. Service friendly and I do appreciate the Metallica homage in their logo."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-03-23,4,This is a cute little place In a basement near times square. I tried their mocha and it was good. I would give this place a 5 star if the coffee was not too sweet. The froth of the coffee was good.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-03-11,5,"Great drip coffee, cold brew and pastries in this somewhat hidden gem on 44th st. They have some of the best coffee in the neighborhood and delicious snacks from Balthazar's which is great when you don't want to go to soho for a scone. The scones are so so good. Small seating area but the few times I've been I've managed to grab a seat."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-03-04,5,"Such a cute, hidden coffee shop! Very small but cozy inside. Hot chocolate with oat milk is so good- 10/10 recommend"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-02-24,5,"Cute and hip little coffee shop in the basement of a semi-busy street near Times Square. I usually avoid the area around Times Square like the plague but happened to stumble upon this spot one day and had to go inside. It gave off major Williamsburg vibes and wasn't too crowded. Think white and black interior with a cute Instagrammable neon sign and some plants.

Coffee was reasonably priced ($2.75 for a small 8oz) and they didn't charge extra for almond milk. Quality coffee and not bitter at all. I got my coffee to go but there was plenty of seating inside and WiFi. Would definitely come back to do work here."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-02-14,5,"Love this little spot! You might walk past it - you have to go down a set of stairs to get to the entrance. Coffee is always delicious (no milk needed) and there are some spots to sit. It's small, so don't expect a seat during rush hour. There are some outlets to charge up while you drink your coffee."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-02-05,4,"Looking for a taste of home whilst visiting NYC. there's something to be said for ordering a coffe and it is the perfect, single cup size, not a big gulp of brown water. I learned they don't serve soy and hot hemp. Perfect. Would be nice if it had more Aussie vibes, and the barista mixed the sugar into the brew. The hipsters serving were a bit too stand offish and perhaps don't get too many Aussies coming in who need to ask how to order. That ticked me off a bit because my expectations were a bit high given the name. However the coffee is damn good!  I'll be back!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-02-02,5,"We were drawn to this cafe due to the Aussie name. We weren't disappointed. You can order a piccolo latte here! It brought me back to Straya. The interior is on the smaller side, but on a weekday morning we found a spot to sit. The basement location is a nice haven away from the street. The plant by the hot water pipe was suffering a bit, so we even watered it! Plants are people too!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-01-22,5,"Cozy, warm, great coffee and really nice staff!! I'll definitely be back when I'm in NYC again!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-01-20,5,"The service was great.  I am an avid coffee drinker but gave it up while pregnant. The barista helped me figure out some tasty decaf options.  The decaf cappuccino came with some nice foam art and was absolutely delicious.  This is not a place to hangout. Very few seats that are not designed  for comfort and no wi-fi. You do not go for the atmosphere, you go cause the coffee is quality.  I will be back for sure."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-01-19,5,Fantastic little spot- like an oasis away from Times Square and Port Authority bus terminal.  Excellent pastries and an oat latte that I would have again in a second.  Great spot thank you!!
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-01-09,5,"For any Aussies looking for Melbourne style coffee, these guys do a great job. Best we had in NYC. Maybe just add an extra shot in your latte."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-01-05,5,Best latte!! Cute little hidden coffee spot!! Have to come and see this place! Had an almond latte and it was delicious! I love how it was hidden from the busy street!
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2019-01-02,3,"The service was good and friendly, however the quality of the drinks was very poor. Prices are okay for New York and around $3.75 or more. Unfortunately, the hot chocolate tasted like chocolate syrup and the americano coffee tasted extremely over-brewed. Nice atmosphere, but horrible products."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-12-28,5,We visited this quaint little coffee shop each day whilst we have been on holidays here in NYC. We are two Australians who have relocated to the US for the next 3 years and we are pretty fussy with coffee. This coffee shop serves Australian Coffee beans and the coffee is fantastic. The barista was very friendly and like us loved a good coffee. We highly recommend this coffee shop. You won't be disappointed!
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-12-27,4,"Cozy little cafe tucked away in the basement of an old building at the edge of the theatre district. I had a latte that was smooth and not overly milky as some lattes can be. The espresso flavor really came through. I wasn't really ""wowed"" by my experience and have had better lattes so I didn't give it the fifth star."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-12-27,4,Love this little joint. The staff are super cool and the coffee is pretty good. The place is a little too small for me...but if you need just a quick pick me up...the Aussie flat white is just like the real thing back in OZ. If
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-12-21,5,"The espresso was very smooth and flavorful, I love that they have good milk alternatives also(oatmilk is the beeneez)."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-11-29,3,"Get: croissant! Nice and flaky

Cute, underground coffee shop near port authority. Came in here before a meeting to kill some time with a croissant and a coffee.

The cappuccino was okay..I did really like that they had a variety of milk options. I got mine with almond milk. Other than that though this was a bit forgettable.

Croissant was pretty good, nicely sized and light and flaky.

It's a smaller shop with about seating for 14+.
Modern minimalist design.

It was quiet when I came in with more people grabbing their coffee to go. Price was about what you would expect for a cafe near Times Square."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-11-20,5,"Just west of Times Square, and right next to the A/C/E train on 44th near 8th Ave, this quaint coffeeshop attracts a clientele of both locals and tourists alike.  With local roasters and various alternative milks (including oat!), it will keep the non-coffee-drinkers and the espresso needs of the hipster totally happy. 

Located in the basement of a tenement building, the cafe has a small number of tables and free wifi, and pastries from various local bakeries, including cookies from Ovenly, and donuts from Underwest (only on Wednesdays and Saturdays last time I checked). 

Definitely a worthwhile stop for your coffee fix in Hell's Kitchen and, as almost every other coffeeshop in NYC, be sure to pick up a punch card if (and when!) you come often."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-11-11,4,"Cute little coffee shop! Not tons of room nor was it super busy so seating wasn't an issue. Great espresso! I'm an outsider stopping in for Times Square and it was a welcome break on a Saturday night to warm up and get a little energy boost for the rest of the night. If I was looking for a place to do work then I would have given it a 3/5, so if you're looking for that maybe go somewhere roomier! However if it's with a buddy or two or you just want to stop in, great option!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-11-09,4,Great coffee! Nice selection of drinks ready to grab and go.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-11-02,4,"Kudos for somehow achieving a downtown vibe & an escape from tourists in Times Square. If not for that I would probably give it 3 stars. The espresso was ok at best and the music varies based on who is working. It varied from crowded to empty fairly quickly on a Friday. They do have plenty of outlets and reliable, free internet. I left because I wasn't a fan of the very loud music choice and the lack of a bathroom or substantial food."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-10-28,2,"It's a cute cafe on 44 street in the basement. It was nicely decorated for Halloween. Our barista was friendly. Unfortunately coffee didn't live up to expectations based on prior reviews. My latte was milky, bland and lacking in taste foam. They have no bathroom and little outside area."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-10-17,4,"This is a small but nice cafe tucked away downstairs of an apartment building on a residential side street. I came here for a coffee and time to sit and read by myself while waiting for a friend. Fair warning, this place doesn't have many seats, and also doesn't have any bathrooms. The staff was nice enough to tell me where I could get a free (and nice bathroom) at a nearby hotel, and I told them to go ahead and make my latte, I would be right back. They had my coffee ready for me by the time I got back, and I had also ordered a doughnut, and that was plated for me to grab, as well. The staff is very friendly, and patient, as I took my time asking about which doughnut I might order. The music is quiet in the background, and the tables are clean, but small. If I wanted a coffee before seeing a show, I would stop by here again."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-10-16,5,"St. Kilda is my go-to coffee spot in my neighborhood - it's calm and inviting, and a nice break from the hectic street above. The baristas are always super friendly and the coffee is excellent."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-10-07,5,Cute little cafe with good coffee. Nice slice of comfort just on the edge of times sq.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-10-07,5,"We stopped in for a quick & light breakfast this morning before taking the bus back to Philadelphia. We were the first in, and really got to enjoy the coffee shop for what it was. It's a cute shop on the lower level and has a lot of great coffee and pastry options. I had the pistachio cardamom bread with a flat white, and it was delightful. My cousins were impressed with the s'mores donut (he said it's more of a cake donut, but still delicious), and the fall-inspired latte art on the Mocha. 

The two baristas were really kind and made sure we felt comfortable. we enjoyed the music they had on, and overall, the atmosphere of the coffee shop. It's a nice place to sit in the morning if you're early enough to beat the crowds. Typical prices you'd expect for a NYC coffee shop."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-10-03,5,"Stumbled into St Kilda on a gorgeous, sunny day on Sunday - prior to brunch.  The service was excellent - both baristas were efficient, friendly, and welcoming.  I got the house drip black, but if you want milk, you have your regular dairy choices plus oat milk, soy, and almond.  I think they have rice but don't remember for sure.  The coffee was perfectly temped at a delicate, yet, warming degree, and it was perfection while I waited to get seated.  After brunch, brought some friends along who also got their caffeine fix.  The space is tiny so definitely better for a grab and go, but they have a nice nook outside that has a bench if you want to nestle yourself in while sipping a soothing cup of finely-roasted and crafted caffeinated brew."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-09-28,4,"It is a cute little cafe. I had a Yerba Mate tea and that was good. It is a good place to work as they have outlets and wifi. However, they don't have a restroom."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-09-27,3,"Nice coffee shop with convenient location. I went to get in some study time before a Broadway show, and this place was within walking distance from Broadway.
Pros: free wifi, available seating (including some benches outside), music is not too loud, many available outlets
Cons: uncomfortable seating (tables are too low and small, the walls are lined with a wire thing that connects the outlets, so if you sat at the tables you will find that leaning against the wall is very uncomfortable), no bathroom, poorly lit, meh prices (paid 2.50 for a small coffee that is about 3/4 of a typical small coffee size)."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-09-20,4,"I love this coffee place. It's super convenient for me to go to in the mornings. Their chai lattes are to die for. It's a bit expensive so that stops me from going in everyday, but it's worth it when I do because they give you a little punch card for every visit and you can redeem a coffee after 10 punches. I wish they had matcha tea, and also more bakery treats or something more breakfast-y to accompany my coffee. Get an almond croissant though. Do it."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-09-12,3,"Underground, hidden, poorly lit cafe with a good amount of seating (about 15 people). Prices are average ($4 for latte, $2.25 for tea). Worried about being let down by midtown coffee not living up to Australian standards, I went with a tea, which they have many flavors of. Jasmine tea was strong and refreshing, enough flavor for two cups. They also have pastries and bars. Music is pretty loud, but there are people working on their laptops here. Service is cool. 

Because it's underground, there's not much ventilation, so it gets stuffy down there."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-09-08,2,"Coffee bean is fresh but the quality of the coffee you get is not consistent due to short staffs. For those who may want to know, no public restroom offered here. Not a customer friendly policy..."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-09-01,4,"Cute little coffee shop underground nice hobo design indoors quiet place to sit and do work or meet with a friend 
AMAZING coffee -I tried their latte and enjoyed it very much full body flavor -no sugar needed 

Only thing is: no bathroom if you need to go and you've been sitting and doing work for a while good luck. Because there is no bathroom for customers

That's a huge downside"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-08-29,3,"I don't know man. I love everything about this place....except for coffee. From the friendly barista to the cool vibe to the extensive menu (with all your third wave pour over stuff) - everything's great...except the coffee itself. I mostly get espresso based drinks here (cortado, cappuccino) and they always taste bland and lifeless. Whatever beans they use for espresso are pretty one-dimensional and lean toward bitter. I can't taste the sweetness or much acidity in them. 

On top of that, I don't know what kind of milk they use (I always ask for regular whole milk) but it just tastes bland. No creamy taste whatsoever. 

I'm gonna keep trying other things at this coffee shop to see if they are any better but espresso/milk based drinks are just not up to par."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-08-23,4,"If you want to hide away from the bustling Times Square, definitely check this place out. The interior has a modern and natural design that makes you feel like you've been transported to the sub urban wilderness. Also, since it's located in the basement, a lot of the street noise is muffled. 

The staff was super friendly. Unlike the usual monotone and uninterested staff who repeat like a broken record ""May I take your order? ...all our drinks are good"", the staff here was full of energy and had a great attitude when recommending me some drinks. 

I ordered an iced coffee with soy milk for $4. It wasn't the best but it was pretty decent. However, $4 for a small cup of coffee is quite expensive. That said, I would come back here if I want to sit down and relax in a quiet environment."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-08-18,3,"Clean, cozy place but okay coffee."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-08-04,4,"Very cute coffee shop! I got a wonderful orange tea. Only about 10-12 seats though. Great, quiet place to do work."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-07-29,5,"I can't stop coming here! Love the location, the shop, the barista, and most importantly the coffee/espresso!! 

I love coming here before heading into work, it feel like such a respite from the commotion of 8th Ave. The decor is clean and and low-key, giving it a very nice atmosphere. It's very well lit for being a ""below the street"" place, and I honestly think that adds to it's charm, you get a visual break form the city too. They have a good amount of seating, and I've always been able to snag a seat if I wanted one. 

Prices are reasonable, if not a bit lower than the typical NYC cafe. It seems like they have a lot of regulars too, the barista seemed to a lot of people who came in. She was really lovely. 

They make such a good latte! The espresso is always perfect, and I don't even add sweetener when I get their latte. The cold brew is also on point, full bodied and not bitter at all. Mmm! They have a good assortment of baked goods too, the chocolate chip cookie has a dash of sea salt which always brings the flavors up a level. 

Do yourself a favor and stop by, this place is a gem!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-07-28,5,"Cute little coffee shop off the craziness of midtown. Below sidewlak level but with windows to let in light, it's like a little oasis in the city bustle. My flat white was perfect and the staff was pleasant. Spend your money here and not Starbucks."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-07-23,4,Great tasting latte. Well made. Service was a little slow but worth waiting for. Good coffee if you are Australian.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-07-22,5,Maybe the best cappuccino in Midtown. It's a bit hidden at the basement level but the espresso drinks are well the walk down a few stairs. Also has a nice vibe for writing.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-07-21,5,"Super cute little coffee shop, friendly staff, plenty of room to catch up with a friend or do some studying. The below-ground location adds charm, while the big windows still allow in plenty of sunlight. One of my new favorite coffee shops."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-07-18,5,"What a nice underground (literally) cafe in Midtown to escape the chaos and embarrassing coffee scene in this area.

It's a really pleasant atmosphere with a clean layout. Since it's below ground, for a moment it takes you away from the sound of honking and sight of cars and trash.

They do an excellent cappuccino too."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-07-14,5,Cute location and friendly staff. My iced cappuccino was also delicious. I would come back here frequently if I lived nearby! Definitely worth checking out
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-07-07,5,Hiding away in a lower level. Avoid the major chain coffee shops near this touristy area. Small spot but decent prices for a good vibe.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-07-06,5,Surprisingly good. Half underground. Cozy and comfortable. Very friendly service. The seats by twindow is a good place to work!
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-07-05,4,Great flat white. Reminds me of Melbourne though I would not go as far as to say it's the Brother Baba Budan of the west.  I'd like to see a shop serving seven seeds. Do that and I'll change my review to 5 stars.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-07-05,5,"BEST COFFEE in Midtown maybe in Manhattan.

It was my second time visiting Manhattan and I've tried more than 10 local coffee shops that have good ratings on Yelp. This one definitely stands out by a long shot. During my 3 weeks stay, I visited this place almost everyday and the staff were super friendly, always open to chat and remembered my usual order. They use SEY Coffee and I even bought some beans home.

They have free wifi. Don't forget to ask for a punch card!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-06-28,5,"Very friendly staff, comfortable atmos, delicious coffee and an unpretentious vibe.  You cannot ask for anymore than that."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-06-28,5,"Excellent coffee, baked goods, and, per my 15yo sons, hot chocolate. Quite small (5 tables, two bars seating 2 each), but no wait for us at 215p on a weekday"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-06-24,5,"I had a lot of fun at this place. I was looking for a cool, locals spot in Hells Kitchen and this was perfect. Great coffee, great staff (although she might have been working solo), and a perfect way to spend the afternoon.

Look, if you're walking around Time Square, don't go to the mega-chain. Support a local business. You've done enough touristy stuff. But down your H&M bag. The Disney store isn't going anywhere.

 Do something truly New York."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-06-22,5,"They've added 'vegan' to the placard for the lemon raspberry loaf. While I was there this evening the nice barista (everybody there is nice) told me they actually carry FOUR vegan treats: lemon raspberry loaf, chocolate chip cookie, banana walnut muffin, and one other item she couldn't remember at the time. She said that all of these treats would be available on Mondays and Thursdays, when they get fresh deliveries. This is a business who cares about all their customers. Go there!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-06-17,2,"This coffee shop should not market itself as ""Australian"" coffee shop. I just returned from Sydney and was trying to find a comparable Flat White. St. Kilda's was much to bitter tasting compared to the every coffee I had in Australia."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-06-16,5,"Friendly coffee house with strong brew and good pastries, including a few gluten-free options. A little bummed that they didn't have soy milk, but they had other non-dairy options. Not huge, but not much competition for the spots to sit and work. They don't have a restroom, but there is one nearby at a hotel that customers can use."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-06-02,5,"Places like this always have the small cups and high prices for what I'm used to, but the Americano I had was fantastic and the latte my wife had was really good she said. The barista was very friendly. I will definitely come back on my next trip to NYC."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-06-02,5,"Exceptional experience, new 'hood spot for me! Thanks for excellent coffee + great friendly baristas! Cheers."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-05-27,5,This is by far the best coffee shop in the neighborhood. High quality espresso coffee that is not over roasted. Milk is steamed just right giving it that velvety texture. Fast and efficient service.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-05-27,5,Giving one of my rare 5 star reviews because the girl making the coffee did a great job with a long line all by herself.  Coffee was good and she was fast at making it.  I loved the shop which appeared to be new in an old building.  Since arriving here I have made it a point not to go to Starbucks at all because of all the great shops in the area.  I will come back!  Great job!
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-05-20,5,"This is probably going to be one of the best and most affordable coffee shops you're going to find near midtown. 

In the heart of NYC, St Kilda Coffee is a hidden gem and I hope it stays that way :) I ordered a cold brew with almond milk and it was very tasty! Service was excellent, super nice people! Also, I would say it is a pretty good spot to get some work done as it wasn't super packed mid afternoon weekday when I went. Free WiFi is always a plus!

5/5 coming back soon :D"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-05-12,4,"We went to New York for the weekend. This coffee place was near our hotel. The place was empty around 11am on Sunday. One or two people were using the WiFi. The shop smelled amazing. I ordered a pour over of the baristas favorite beans. I can't remember what he recommended (something from Kenya that I could not pronounce) but it was delicious. Very flavorful, strong, but nice finish.  Cost $6.50, but they do have free stickers!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-05-10,5,"My drink!

My piccolo, aka cortado or gibraltar (as dubbed in other locations) was fantastic. The espresso was a bit fruitier than I like, but its preparation along with the milk was right on par. 

The ambience:

I loved walking down into this slightly below sidewalk level coffee shop. I almost felt like I was somewhere tropical with the plants dotting the staircase one descends to enter the cafe. 

There's room for about 20 people to sit  - individual people and a group were working away. Also, It didn't hurt that the Clash was on....

The baristas:

Kristen and Amanda were so down-to-Earth and I am pretty sure that they alone made me biased to liking whatever drink I was going to get. Thank you so much for being so cool. Very cool vibes!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-04-30,5,"The general rule in NYC is the further away from Times Square you go, the better the coffee becomes. St. Kilda Coffee is the exception. On 44th St in between 9th and 10th Avenues, it's 1.5 blocks from Times Square (aka the tourist trap). As any good coffee shop should that close to Times Square, it's hidden in the basement of a building and very easy to miss. But don't. It's worth not missing.

It's a small espresso shop with two small tables at the window, four small tables to the right, and a medium sized table to the left when you walk in. The bar is at the back crafting a great cup of espresso or latte. Pastries are served all day and the corn flake blueberry muffin is one of the best muffins in NYC. Just outside the basement are a few black benches to enjoy the outside with your cup of coffee.

Surprisingly, it's a cozy place to work. Most people get their coffee to go so you're bound to find an open table. With plenty of outlets throughout the shop an strong free WIFI ( network name is ""Cafedownunder"" and password is ""findusonyelp"" as of April 30, 2018), it's a great spot to work.

Another thing to note is the barista is friendly. NYC AND coffee shops get a bad rap on friendliness so that says something! A NYC barista nice? AWESOME!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-04-28,5,"The smoothest latte I've ever had not going to lie.

Really good coffee. Average NYC prices. I think the small latte was $3? 

I've had lattes in Europe and this one wins by far."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-04-27,5,"Cool and eclectic; good music, friendly staff. They got pastries, the small peanut butter cookies are great. Americano was excellent. Away from the suffocating crowds. Highly recommended!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-04-11,5,Great coffee....great atmosphere!  Quiet escape from the city noises and a Melbourne like coffee
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-04-09,5,Obsessed! From the bomb ass coffee that isn't burnt (something I didn't know was possible in this city) to the atmosphere to the very friendly staff. Love love love it.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-04-07,5,"Hidden gem near time square on 44th street, down one flight of stairs.


Great tasting espresso drinks, they use birch beans.

It is a bit small but you maybe able to grab a seat still. Friendly wait staff, I say that because the barista remade my drink after she realized she put too much milk in my cortado.

Would definitely stop by here if I'm in the area again!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-03-31,5,"Really good coffee and atmosphere. You don't see it right away, because its below the street, but once you're there, it's nice not to have to stare at people walking by. There's also not a ton of seating."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-03-25,4,"Cute coffee shop in Hell's Kitchen area located on 44th street on the lower level off the street. There's a decent amount of seating given the store size- probably seats 15-16 people. Didn't see a bathroom though. 

Very friendly baristas and service. They have your typical espresso menu and also have drip coffee and cold brew. They have this Kyoto cold brew which is supposed to stronger than regular cold brew. They carry almond, soy and oatly oat milk. 

I sat to read for a little over an hour- with ear phones it's pretty good. Without ear phones it's not that quiet. But they play typical coffee house chill music otherwise. It's a little dim for studying I feel. 

The decor is more on the edgy hipster side- mostly black and white decor. Not your typical brightly lit/ girly kinda coffee shop. They have a cute neon sign for that says ""damn fine coffee"" which is their slogan I think. 

Overall I like this coffee spot! It's pretty unique and I like the vibe and coffee"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-03-22,4,"I come in often for coffee here. Except for how pricey they are coffee is good and the breakfast items (croissant, scone, donuts on wed) are decent and from well-known places. Only thing I do not like about this place is the fact that you order a large iced latte and they say it is extra to request extra shot or something along the line.. I don't exactly remember but something along that line. Will ask next time and correct my review if necessary!"
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-03-20,4,Nice underground place for a cup of coffee :) Quiet and satisfying calm.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-03-15,5,"Best americano in Manhattan. It's a tiny joint, but definitely worth finding. Service is impeccable and the location is super close to everything."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-03-11,3,"I used to enjoy coming here for coffee until just recently when their ""kyoto"" started tasting just like their cold brew. Their latte and flat white are tasty but their ""kyoto""/drip coffee is nothing special."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-03-10,5,"When it comes to coffee, St. Kilda's baristas know their stuff. The right beans, perfect roast, and shots expertly pulled on a professional, well-maintained espresso machine. All about the coffee here. Highly recommended."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-02-26,5,"Pauline the barista was very kind and equally as helpful. Great coffee and a thoughtful selection of it! They had a nice Colombian espresso from Sey and a Columbia from Brandy and Wine roasters that we're different and both very well dialed. If you're into coffee, hit this place up."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-02-24,5,"For me, the coffee boasts the perfect combination of temperature, smell, and taste. It has a nice blend of sour and sweet flavors."
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-02-24,5,They make a killer Latte! It's underground a bit so it's not so easy to find but once you find it you'll keep coming back.
86,st-kilda-coffee-new-york,2018-02-19,3,"Coffee on Presidents' Day!

Pros:
It is pretty empty when a few coffee spots close by are packed...
Latte is pretty good.

Cons:
It's in the basement. 
Not too much natural light. I love natural lights!

Not sure if I'll come back..."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2020-03-15,2,"I was looking for whole, unground spices, which they don't generally sell. They do provide cumin seeds or coriander but at $7/puch or $13/tin this is not a sustainable buy."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2019-11-13,5,"This place is fantastic , so many healthy & hard to find goodies. A few weeks ago they didntput my salt in bag & today no questions asked not even receipt he gave me & even added really good fish stew spice mix . They have all the stuff Dr Oz talks about being super benificial, I'm on a new health kick & this is definitely going to be a weekly stop for me."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2019-09-25,1,"Came here on a weekday. One girl out of three was offering service, the other two were just hiding behind the counter. Literally waiting over 20 minutes just to get served and had two people cut in front of me. Finally one of the girls stood ip and helped me and it was the most lethargic help ever that I literally had to say hi to her for her to serve me, since she was just in a daze. Bought two tins and instantly regretted it after I saw flies flying all over the teas and landing on them. Teas are supposed to be sealed to maintain freshness AND prevent bugs from flying. A waste of 25$"
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2019-02-16,1,"The employee that was on duty was the WORST!  He was the most inattentive, lazy person ever. He didn't want to answer questions. And had MAJOR attitude. He probably should get a different job. He sucks and I'll find somewhere else to get my tea."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2018-12-22,1,"The service is beyond terrible, it's the worst cliche about rude NY behavior and I'm embarrassed that this place is representing NY service at such a lovely location.  First off there were 4-5 employees plus the owner behind the counter but no one would acknowledge anyone's presence.  I had to stand in the pay line to be helped.  Then I was made fun of for asking a question and when I pushed again I still couldn't get a straight answer.  I ordered my bags of spices, had to wait forever between each spice and paying because the vapid young woman helping couldn't have been more slow and whispering with her friend the whole time.  Finally when home and taking them out of the bag, one of the bags was not sealed and half my chipotle powder fell all over my kitchen.  I have one last thing to say - Get OVER YOURSELVES - it's just spice and tease."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2016-08-29,4,"Came here to get some teas and spices. It's not my first time here. I've been coming here to get spices. I enjoy shopping here because I enjoy spices. I never bought teas here but this time I came to buy teas and spices. They usually have great and attentive staff and know about the spices well. This time the guy served me while  a girl worked on packing the stuff to mail out and I thought that was cool. I also got some spices for hubby to grill and something for me to marinate. The products can be packed in small, medium  and large packet. Your call. Next time will try something unique. Oh yes I did get something unique, a tiny packet of truffle salt! Expensive but I'll try very little. I hardly use salt when I cook so this will last a very long time. Come by the store and say hello to the colorful world of spice. Nice!"
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2016-08-01,4,"I have been going to the Grand Central Market over the years and yet this is my first time stopping at  Spices & Tease. My BFF has been taking Ginger teas lately and wanted to try Anise tea due to stomach issues. So I need to fine seeds not the stars a decided to come here.

The Spices and Herbs here are not just for cooking but for good heath, Zen,  and for making amazing flavored hot and iced teas, like colada hibiscus blend, lavender and strawberry rhubarb black tea, etc.

They also carry salt and pepper set, I counted 16 different peppers and more than 10 types of gourmet salt. 
 
They sell different size packets and tins, I was looking for Anise seeds and they had them and I got a small size packet for $5 which was about 2oz.  Another place had the the seed for $9.  But other spices are at different prices.

The staff is cool and will give  you advise and preparation instructions if you ask."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2016-06-20,4,"I love Spices and Tease  they sell great products and make nice gifts. I took off a star because of their online shipping. I ordered a gift on the 11 so that it would arrive before Father's Day on the 19. The shipping label was printed late Friday night, the 16, and still hasn't shipped yet. If you use their online store order weeks in advance or go to the store and ship yourself."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2015-12-21,2,"We purchased some spice blends that seemed to be intriguing.  However, in the packaging, the combination of spices is not specified.  I went on their website to get an idea of what they are and for recipes, and I got a website warning from my antivirus protection that it is high risk. Some of the tins do not open easily, and you must be careful not to spill if you try to force them open.  I haven't tried the spices yet, so I will post later, but hopefully they will take care of these issues.  I didn't want to give a rating without trying the product first, but unable to post this feedback without it."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2015-12-07,5,"Incredibly vast selection of spice blends, salts, herbal teas and accessories. 

I was here looking specifically for some tea blends that would make amazing iced teas. I settled on a piña colada hibiscus blend and a strawberry rhubarb black tea. Since the small tins were 3 for $20 we decided to try the stress blocker tea which was a mix of lavender and other flavors that are supposed to zen you out. 

Yes, prices are steep but I've personally never bought good quality loose tea that wasn't expensive and it usually is a good amount to last you quite some time. 

They also have some pre-packaged teas and spices making this a wonderful place to stop and buy holiday gifts for the foodies and herbal tea drinkers in your lives."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2015-08-18,3,"Tea is good but EXTREMELY overpriced. Staff was not very friendly, and you have to buy a full sized drink to sample the tea. I would recommend Harney & Sons over this any day."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2015-04-30,4,"Though it's been months since my last visit to Spices & Tease, I absolutely love this place. I once stumbled across Grand Central Market last summer while killing some time waiting for a friend, and once I came across Spices & Tease I instantly stopped in my tracks. For one, the strong smells coming from the big bowls of vibrantly-colored spices definitely grabbed my attention. But once I saw the teas, I knew I had to investigate further. I absolutely LOVE herbal tea; I have several cups daily. So after scanning their selection I knew I had to come back when I had a little extra money to spend.

When I finally had a chance to go back I purchased 3 tins of loose tea for $20, definitely a bit pricey but I felt like splurging that day, and I did not regret it. I purchased the Pina Colada Hibiscus (hibiscus, rosehips, pineapple & coconut), Chocolate Ginger Rooibos, and Feel Well Balanced (hibiscus, lemongrass, rooibos, and orange peels). The latter two were definitely tasty, but the pina colada hibiscus stole my heart. It's a bright, flavorful, and invigorating tea that goes great with a spoon of honey. 

Out of curiosity, on a separate occasion, I decided to splurge again, this time on the flavored sugar. To be honest, I didn't really need them, but in the presence of all that tea my impulse control was pretty much nonexistant. I ended up buying the rose, lavender, and ginger nut sugars. Ginger nut didn't really taste like anything but the rose and lavender were great.

If you're a tea lover looking to add some unique blends to your collection, check this place out. It's definitely pricey but for the quality of loose leaf tea that you're getting, it's worth trying at least once."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2015-02-26,2,"Amazing selection of spices; however I gave 2 stars because they were so rude and unhelpful. I had to ask twice how much something was because it was not posted and when the person behind the counter finally responded, she acted like it was a problem to answer a question. She did not offer assistance or suggestions at all. It was clearly more important for her to get back to whatever she was doing with her co-worker. I was irritated to the point that I didn't want to make the purchase, but my spouse really wanted to get those particular spices for his sister before we left. Why would I want to spend that much on salt and pepper from someone who can't be bothered to tell me how much it costs in the first place? Uggh!"
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2014-08-22,4,"Just phenomenal!  Quality customer service, so pleasing to the eyes and the ole factory system, quality spices, phenomenal pepper selection, and some good pricing, if you look.  Spices and teas aren't inexpensive, and quality is worth the price tag.  It is Grand Central Market.  So you know you're going to get a hike in price.  I feel that some of the prices a it much, even for the venue and product.  But the large tins provide you with a hefty amount of the product, which will last you for some time, and is on par - if not, in some cases, better than - Penzey.  I highly recommend checking them out, at the very least, for just the aesthetic fulfillment, if not to stock up on some amazing items."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2014-06-14,5,"I've walked by Spices & Tease so many times in the Grand Central Market. 

Today, I needed to pick up a quick little gift for my brother-in-law and since he loves to grill salmon, Andy (and Cheyenne [sp?]) at Spices & Tease recommended the Japanese 7 spices which looks awesome! Comes in a cute little tin. 

This is a perfect place to swing by if you need to pick up a quick, interesting gift, especially in the summer months when people tend to barbecue and grill outdoors.

Can't wait to return!"
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2014-02-19,4,"Food can be totally delicious. But, think about going to a restaurant or food vendor and eating unseasoned, completely bare food. I'm pretty sure that all of those places would be out of business. If you're looking for the hub of spices and teas, look no further than Spices and Tease.

I picked up some Hawaiian Black Lava Salt because, a) I've never tried it before, and b) It looked really cool (duh). The salt gets its color by mixing it with activated charcoal which is said to give it a distinctive nutty flavor.

And then, because I can never pass up some candy, I got some Fennel Candy. It's one of my favorite parts about dining out at an Indian restaurant, and now I don't have to leave home to enjoy it."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2014-01-09,5,"I LOVE this place. I'm a huge tea fan. Always on the prowl for new places to drink tea.
This is perfect! Bowls and bowls of loose leaf teas for you to sift through. A little bazaar that completely immerses you into the place. 

I always get a little too excited when I enter this shop. The options! The smells! They have very reasonable prices. I always leave with an extra skip in my step."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2014-01-02,5,"Great assortment of loose leaf teas and spices to choose from. I had to wait a little since there were only two associates and they were both very busy. I didn't mind since it gave me time to narrow down my tea preferences. 

I bought the holiday special of the small tin tea trio with the relaxation blend, chocolate orange, and coconut jasmine green tea. The individuals who received the tons for Christmas absolutely loved them! Reasonable prices to pay for good quality tea.

This place is a must for tea lovers!"
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2013-12-28,3,"This review is about my shopping experience. I will provide another review after I use the spice given. 

This place smells fantastic. I stopped here with my wife while I was in NYC the weekend before Christmas celebrating the holidays. The two of us always come but our party seems to grow a little more every year. With us was a young lady that recently graduated from culinary school and was delighted by the spices in front of her. 

We were able to get a large tin of spice for $10+ ($2 more for a premium spice). The first young lady we spoke to was helpful and answered all our questions, even as the stand got busy with the Saturday tourist crowd. We stepped aside to make our decision and to allow her to serve other customers. The young lady that actually rang us up once we finally decided what we wanted to purchase, and her friend were more concerned about how many girls of the opposite race I was with. Nice way to end a good shopping experience."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2013-10-14,5,"I loved this little stall. True, we walked by it a coupla times before finally stopping to take a look, but once we did, we realized how many good items they had for sale, and decided to get some things to take home. 

The girl working this morning was so super friendly and helpful. She took the time to answer our questions and wrapped up the tins that we were giving as a gift. 

We bought the three-tin gift bag with a tin of Japanese Seven Spices, a tin of Passionfruit Black tea and a tin of Pear Green tea. I hope the gift recipient likes it!

For ourselves, we bought a tin of the Lychee Black tea, a tin of the Spicy Chocolate White tea and a tin of Chai Black tea. I can't wait to get home to try it out!

I was pleasantly surprised by the price. It was three large tins for $30, and she really hooked us up with the tea that was packed in there. 

It's certainly priced better than Teavana, and I'm hoping that the tea tastes just as good!"
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2012-12-28,1,"This store replaced Penzeys Spices, which had spices of very high quality at good prices.  Perhaps as a result, this review might be harsher than warranted.  They do, after all, offer a nice selection of spices and even complement that with an OK selection of teas.  I can't, however, get over how the store and display their merchandise.  

Spices should be stored in sealed containers, away from air, humidity, and light.   And what's true of spices is event truer of teas, which easily absorb surrounding odors.  These folks, however, display everything in open mounds, piled one next to the other.  It looks pretty, but it also compromises the quality of their teas and spices.  Worse, when shoveling spices into containers, particles occasionally fall into nearby mounds.   I would treat this store as nothing  more than window-dressing for tourists.  Spices & Teas is clearly more interested in its display than in providing a good product.  People who care about spices or teas should look elsewhere."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2012-10-13,3,"Although this store is located within the bustling Grand Central Market, it's not really set up to sell anything to passing commuters. Nothing is pre-packaged, and it's staffed by only one employee.

One employee who carefully assembles and wraps a gift assortment for a pair of happily oblivious tourists. Taking his time. Doing it right.

His concentration was impressive. He didn't even seem to notice when my head exploded."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2012-10-11,4,"Absolutely LOVED this place. It was almost like shopping in a Moroccan bazaar with the spices all laid out. The guys behind the counter will bring the spices up to you to sniff.

The variety is good with single spices to mixtures suitable for different cooking purposes.

They also have teas, but it was the spices which caught my attention. It is a little pricey, but oh so intriguing."
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2012-06-26,5,"Ran through Grand Central Station looking for a gift. As I pushed and shoved through the crowd (  learned from my New Yorker friends) I smelled something delicious in the air. Spices & Tease caught my attention right from the start. 
I was lost and just knew that I needed a souvenir. 
The girl working there basically gave me a course on teas! She was awesome! I learned so much and ended up buying a small tin. 
Small tins run for $7.00, a little over priced, but the information on teas definitely made up for it.
The girl was so nice she even opened up the tea case and let me take a picture! 

¡ Muy Delicioso!"
87,spices-and-tease-new-york-3,2012-05-07,1,"I recently visited this nice spice store inside the Grand Central Market. When it came time to pay, my credit card got swiped on an smart phone. When asked if I wanted to punch in my phone number to get a receipt, I ignored the little voice in my head telling me not to and did it anyway. Sure enough the same night I got spam! 

I NEVER get spam on my phone, so I know it's them.

This is completely unacceptable. I have plenty of options where to by spaces, so I'll be sure never to give them my business again."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2019-10-01,4,"Arrived early for a business meeting.  Tried the pumpkin spice cold brew.  It was great, service was good, employees friendly, and the restaurant was clean.  There is only one area near window for sitting with three bar stools.   This location is a grab and go."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2019-09-19,5,"I had to pick up a very large order and the supervisor Ingram, made sure she had coverage, helped me walk it to my destination across the street. It was such a sweet gesture! And made my day and my life easier. Also, while I was there as they did everything they could to help me carry my order easily I noticed the personal connections they made with each guest. I would say this is the best Starbucks I have ever been to. Thank you so much! I hope I am in this neighborhood again soon so I can come back!"
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2019-08-09,5,"I see a lot of bad reviews but the most recent before mine is pretty good. Maybe they changed management. IDK b/c the 3 times I've been there this month I had a good experience. For example, Dale the manager is GREAT! I had I problem with my coffee and he sent me another one and all I can say is this is the best Starbucks I've been too. I thought 39th and Park was my spot, but it looks like 42 and Park takes the cake!  And let me tell you, they get BUSY!! esp. being right next to Grand Central Terminal. I'm impressed b/c, I've worked in customer service for years and with that type of VOLUME its easy to lag with customer service and just trying to get orders out."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2019-05-19,1,The doors are still locked 20 minutes past opening. wats of my time and super annoying
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2019-04-06,5,"The service today was great! The employees in the morning were very helpful. I let them know my dilemma, that i was late for work, and showed them how I ordered my Starbucks to the wrong location. They accommodated me the best they could! They were very friendly. Thanks for helping me out!"
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2019-01-04,1,"This is not my go-to Starbucks but whenever I need a quick pick me up, I would come here. And the past several times I came here, the place is chaotic and a mess. I feel like their staff are not well trained in taking orders and they're so disorganized. Today, I placed a mobile order in advance thinking it will take some time for my stuff to be ready. I say I placed the order about 10 mins in advance. By the time I arrived, they just put out my Frappuccino order but I was still waiting for my bagel and cream cheese order. I waited for another 15-20 mins and to be honest, I wasn't the only one who was frustrated. The lady next to me was about to punch the barista when she said she placed an order for a tall coffee and was waiting for almost 20 minutes for it. I mean there's really no excuse to wait that long for that kind of order. They really just need to pour brewed coffee into a cup. How hard is that?!"
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2018-06-28,1,"The most horrible Starbucks I've ever been too.  Slow, inattentive, and rude ....Starbucks instead of sensitivity training - maybe you should consider starting with qualified people and THEN training them"
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2018-02-14,3,"This is not my favorite Starbucks location because of the lack of seats and service was slow. It's a really small grab and go beverage type of place. If you need to use the restroom, it's non-existent! Just walk across the street and find one at the grand central terminal."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2017-12-03,1,I've never seen 2 employees hate their life as much as the 2 working right now. The girl seems to have a permanent eye roll. I'm used to Starbucks having customer service or somewhat of a smile. It's like they were inconvenienced by the customers being here.
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2017-11-16,1,"Worst Starbucks I've been to. I lived in Midtown East and work here too and they always forget my mobile orders, and then give attitude when you ask where it is. It's down the street from my work, but I would rather walk blocks away to the next one."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2017-09-21,1,"Went to this Starbucks location during the evening. The customer service I received was pretty fair. It wasn't the best versus other locations. I was pretty ticked off when a employee by the name Rachelle made me a drink(Java Chip) that tasted awful. I had asked her to add more flavor because it was bland, but instead she added a random favor to my frappe and it made my drink taste horrific! $6.25 down the drain! Thanks for the horrible experience."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2017-07-06,1,"My barista was clearly unhappy, maybe because she was given a shift on Independence Day or maybe because she was sad in real life. Either way, she was angry that she made the wrong drink for me. I asked and paid for a latte and she made a macchiato. When no one picked up the macchiato, she asked if I had ordered it and I let her know in my very elevated American spirits that day that I ordered a latte. She grunted and made a smack and almost rolled her eyes, but she sure didn't (thank the American gods for helping her during this moment!). I would've gladly taken the macchiato as it is almost the same thing to me, it's the holidays, I was in no rush, and chatting with my friend and also another gal who was dressed in birthday attire on this special day. Also, I am a frequent and loyal customer to Starbucks and understand the specificity and extreme timeliness that other customers expect and especially that day, that did not apply to me. At the end of the day, I came in for exactly the drink I wanted when I walked in, but I'll remember and avoid this location just in case."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2017-03-22,2,"No restrooms, no seats, service is so slow. 

Try to order to go if you really need that cup of Starbucks to wake you up or chill you down.

P.S. Do not waste your money on their sandwiches, it's just not worth it, even food court or food truck they can make a sandwich much cheaper and tasty. Sorry, I can have 3 Starbucks coffee or tea per day, but no Starbucks sandwiches please!"
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2017-01-17,2,This would be an ideal Starbucks for me to go to as I pass it while walking from Grand Central to my office however they are SO slow. They need to pick up the pace. I usually don't mind to wait on a long Starbucks line because typically the line still moves quickly. The line at this Starbucks however doesn't move at all. I don't know why I bother .. sometimes I wait for 10 mins and then just end up leaving and walking to the one on 40th and lex which is SO much faster. I feel bad giving two stars because some of the employees are nice but they really just need to put some pep in their step!
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2016-09-19,2,"This is not a good Starbucks.  While the people are mildly polite, they are incredibly slow and one of the days (Sunday) they opened 15 minutes late and saw me waiting thru the door only to tell me ""5 more minutes""... I don't know how it is acceptable to open almost a 1/2 hour late, but the crew working that morning felt that it was. 

Aside from the time in line and the lack of punctuality- the food items (cold) seem to be scarce, they run out of blonde roast early, and they even leave jugs of milk out on the counter because they cannot be bothered to fill up a container."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2016-07-07,1,These people don't like you in the store... Bought 2 drinks and had to pay with 50dollars and the guy did not want to take the money... Had to look for all my small coins to pay... Never come here again
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2015-11-24,2,"Probably the 3rd worst location in Manhattan that I've been to. The staff are constantly joking and act like its a hangout rather than a job, constantly making mistakes on my drink, always giving me half a cup full of ice when I ask for light ice or no ice."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2015-06-09,2,"There is a reason why no one is here:(((. The workers here are super nasty and mean.!! Spare yourself 5$ a coffee and go to another location. I got a caramel macchiato and they didn't even ask me if I wanted whipped cream, when I told them that I do; they Told me that they simply can't because it won't fit? What about a larger cup??? I will never come back here"
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2015-05-01,1,"Just go the next Starbucks....

Tiny modified Starbucks that you have to ask for milk before you order in your coffee but nobody tells you that.

Coffee was old and cold by the time I got it.

Just go to the next one..."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2013-04-08,3,"Small crowded Starbucks without a bathroom but they have not screwed up my order yet, in fact, they seem to be on the ball every time I'm there.  Right next to subway exit so it is convenient when I am on the Lexington line."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2013-03-11,5,"Out of all 50 million Starbucks in the city, this is one of my favorites. I had the most perfect quad grande nonfat caramel macchiato the other morning. You would think that this would be a simple task for a barista, but I've been disappointed many times. Great job to the two guys who were working Friday morning! You made my day!"
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2012-11-05,3,"Has to be one of the smallest Starbucks around. I made a pit stop here tonight for a cup of coffee since the subways were a clusterf**k because of Hurricane Sandy and I decided to walk up to Grand Central to try and get on a train.

No seating here other than a few counters by the window. No tables and chairs. Not even a bathroom. Not much else. I think they have wifi. At least they have coffee.

Gotta say the two guys working here were a rip. Quick and friendly service. Seems like they know the regulars who drop in too. Pretty much right aross the street from Grand Central Station so I can bet it's super busy in the mornings, but probably just for grab and go on the way to work."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2012-07-20,4,"I pass at least five Starbucks on my walk to work (no joke), but I prefer this particular location by far. This location is very small, but it does the job: they know what they're doing, and they're efficient.

It's literally a minute away from my office, so if I'm ever rushing in the morning and don't have lots of time to spare, I am normally able to go in and come out with my drink in two minutes with no problem. I have had plenty of bad experiences with other Starbucks locations, and even when there is a line in the morning, it moves quickly. 

It's normally the same two guys working whenever I come in for my Starbucks at 6:45am. They work well together and quickly deliver service. However, the most recent time that I stopped by, a different barista was making all the drinks while one of the regular guys I see was the cashier. The barista seemed much more chatty and seemed to take his time completing the orders. He was joking around with the cashier, grabbing things from the back storage, and doing basically everything except making my drink.

When the barista finally got around to making my drink, he totally forgot what I had ordered and had to ask me again. I told him I had ordered a tall cinnamon dolce frappuccino. He asked, ""Do you want a venti instead?"" I said ""Sure, why not?"" I had already paid, so he was giving me a venti when I paid the price for a tall. As he handed me my drink, he said ""Sorry for the wait.""

Although I was initially irked that he was moving at a snail's pace to make my drink (luckily I had time to spare before work), I was extremely satisfied that he acknowledged his fault and made up with service recovery. Although it shouldn't have happened in the first place, I was satisfied with the customer service, and I will continue to make this my regular Starbucks location.

* edit

Ah, I also wish this location was open earlier on the weekends when I need my coffee when I come in early to the office on Saturday. It doesn't open until 7am."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2011-11-10,3,"As part of a move to a new office building with three Starbucks within one block in three different directions, I recently ""auditioned"" this Starbucks in the morning, at lunch, and in the afternoon.  It came in third.  The morning crew seems to like each other, but I don't know if they like anyone who comes in there (I'm sure they do, but sheesh you wouldn't know it).  Especially the barista who delivers your drink to you.  He doesn't say a word, doesn't look at you, doesn't engage in any conversation, he just churns.  Not part of the Starbucks experience.

No need to head back here.  

And even though this is a small Starbucks, the mess of airport shuttles that leave from right in front of it just kind of makes for a dodgy experience getting in and out of here.  Literally dodgy - like, watch out for the tourists and their luggage."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2011-07-21,2,"Man, can you say Bad Service?!

I get that a Starbucks in New York could possibly be the most busiest place of all, but that doesn't mean you have to ignore my slightly altered coffee order. 2 stars for getting me the actual latte I ordered, but also for adding to it everything I asked very nicely to avoid, THREE TIMES."
88,starbucks-new-york-350,2008-01-31,4,"This is an extremely small Starbucks tucked away off Park Avenue.  The staff was really friendly.  When I asked for a the turkey-bacon breakfast sandwich, the barista said, ""Good choice!""  The bad thing was that they then were out of them.  They tried offering the real bacon one to me, but I told them I'd just go down 200 feet to the next Starbucks.  

This is not really the place to come and sit as there are only 2 tables and a small bar.  I think there were 2 outlets, but maybe only 1.  

*WiFi hotspot (TMobile)

89,remi-43-new-york-2,2020-05-29,5,"This is my favorite coffee shop in NYC. Packed with beautiful plans and flowers, their coffee is delicious. Their original location is on 48th - and previously held position of favorite coffee shop - but this location is bigger and has lots of bright light. They're new, but I had the chance to go here a few times before the pandemic and it was great place to do some work and have some coffee. During COVID19 crisis, I've been going here a few times per week to get very good coffee and support a good local business. Encourage you to do the same."
89,remi-43-new-york-2,2020-05-27,1,"I bought an almond danish ($5). I thought it looked too well done but perhaps it would taste good. It was far and away the worst danish I've ever had and I've had a lot of danish! Stick with, what I hear, is good coffee."
89,remi-43-new-york-2,2020-05-13,5,"I discovered Remi's amazing matcha latte literally the day before the city shut down due to COVID - they are now open again with limited hours, and thank god. The matcha here is very smooth, even in the iced latte, and the matcha / oat milk (Oatly!) ratio is perfect. Like others have said, the space is absolutely beautiful and filled with flowers - would be a great place to sit and get some work done or settle with a book, whenever doing that that won't contribute to an ongoing public health crisis."
89,remi-43-new-york-2,2020-03-15,5,"Yessss! Love their other location, but this one is even better. Absolutely beautiful spot with incredible coffee. Wife is obsessed with their lavender latte."
89,remi-43-new-york-2,2020-03-02,5,"Beautiful cafe and flower shop. There was so much sunlight when I was there - I was amazed!
All the flower arrangement and succulents give the place a special beauty. Everytime I looked around a different arrangement caught my eye. They also have a station where they make arrangements. So I could watch them work!"
89,remi-43-new-york-2,2020-02-23,5,"As a huge fan of flowers, coffee, and sunlight, I was thrilled to see a new Remi location in midtown! For those who haven't been to the original floral oasis up 2nd Ave on 48th, here's another opportunity. The new space captures the same aesthetic and inherits the extensive latte menu (as well as the usual coffee and pasty selection), with more space and more windows! 

Remi has high quality coffee drinks and the prettiest views you can find in midtown. The other location gets crowded for this exact reason, so I'm so excited that this new space has opened. Seems like the dog-friendly policy carries over as well. Start a crazy midtown morning right with some coffee and dog and flower watching at Remi."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2019-10-29,4,"Friendly staff and clean store. I ordered the beyond meat breakfast sandwich and it really tasted like meat. Which kind of threw me off guard since I haven't had meat for years. But nevertheless looks like meat and tasted like meat, lol. I also got the pumpkin spice latte, a little sweeter then I expected but still very tasty. The only reason why I gave it a 4 stars because the cashier had no idea what he was doing."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2019-04-26,2,"Come here for a cup of Cupertino Blast in a rainy day! A lot of people in there. The two cashiers also have to make the drinks. They're little overlooked when I am there! 

The store has a sign on the wall said Tables and chairs maximum 15 minutes with foods or drinks purchase! This policy itself already deserves for a one star rating! 

The store is disorganized, they did not keep up the dining area very well!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2019-03-13,2,The only redeeming factor is they still have Pumpkin Spice flavor. Staff in the evening can be quite rude.
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2019-02-17,5,"This Store has very good workers, the guy who attended me was very kind.
I really like when people say hi, smile, and show interest on give you a good attention."

In the picture are Omar and Alicia both are great friendly people and ready to serve. I wouldn't have my coffee and treats anywhere else. Don't believe me stop by and check it out. Maybe you will get a chance to meet Ahmed Van and a lot of other great workers
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-12-14,5,"Check out these tees!  You'll be using exclamation points too to describe the great service, amazing coffee, and delicious treats you'll find at this incredible DD location!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-12-11,5,The staff is always so friendly and warm when you walk in. Truly a happy location!  The manager is especially friendly and assists with anything you need.
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-12-11,5,This Dunkin Donuts has the best customer service.  The employees are incredibly sweet and always super helpful.
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-12-07,5,This location so good and so clean especially evening shift. They work so hard to give us a good servic.  Sadik. Omar rejwan is great. I love to go there. I enjoy the world cup they have led tv on wall.  Great place.
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-12-02,5,"This is a fantastic Dunkin location. The staff is very friendly and gets to know their regulars (both their orders and them personally.) They are extremely quick, attentive to their customers needs, and almost always get orders correctly. Highly recommend!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-12-02,5,I have been eating and drinking Dunkin' for years. This is easily the fastest Dunkin' around. The food is always great and the coffee is even better. They have a friendly staff and it's super convenient.
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-11-29,5,My go-to spot every single morning for coffee. I order through my app and pick up without waiting in line - every time without fail my order awaits me. The staff is very on top of it at this location and I do find the donuts to be fresher than at other locations I have been to.
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-11-29,5,"Omar is the best !
 Great coffee great service 
Great neighborhood 
Service dog friendly"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-11-27,5,"This store has become a real star! The 3 mgrs....have turned this into a well oiled coffee machine. The staff even knows how I like my Iced coffee and a different order of hot coffee! The day staff is hilarious and speedy and the guys at night are fun and always glad to see me!I always feel welcomed!
DD has excellent coffee and multiple choices of flavors as well...occasionally I have seen them run low on donuts but it speaks to how popular they are in the neighborhood! I often get sandwiches or specials ...and always an order of hash browns!!!
The place is small but it's what it is...and sometimes it's very busy...they work hard to keep it clean...and  they move that line and you rarely wait very long! Did I say how much I love their coffee???
Love this branch!....check them out!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-11-27,5,"Omar is a great Mgr. Everyday as I go to this DD location, he takes time to greet all Customers, ensuring the operation is going smoothly!
There's a great selection of everything there, reasonably
priced .
DD is my favorite!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-11-23,5,I have traveled all across the county and visited many Dunkin's over the years.  This is the one I keep coming back to. The staff is incredible.  Very talented with impeccable customer service.  I always leave with a full belly and a satisfied feeling.  You couldn't ask for a better experience.  I wouldn't hesitate to travel over a hour to visit this location.  Life is short don't waste your short years on a inferior coffee shop.  Visit this location today.
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-11-23,5,I've been coming here almost daily since 2014. This is far and away my favorite Dunkin'. My order is always made quick or is ready when I arrive if I order ahead. The owner knows my husband and I by name and always makes a point to converse with us.

90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-11-23,5,Very clean store with friendly staff. Always get exactly what I ask for. Love coming here.
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-11-23,5,"Every time I come to this Dunkin' Donuts the lady at the front is always smiling , and in the busy mornings sometimes that's all you need! Also they make your coffee fast and they don't have you waiting forever!!!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-11-23,5,"I've been to this location more times than I can count, and each time, I was greeted by friendly staff and the smell of delicious coffee. 100% would recommend to a friend. P.S. bring back the tuna melt on a croissant!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-11-23,5,"Fave Dunkin Donuts in Hell's Kitchen! Their iced tea is brewed strong, and they get your order right!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-11-23,5,"I've been coming here since early 2016. By far my favorite DD - employees are great, attentive, and have a good sense of humor. They never run out of my favorites and even give me pumpkin coffee after it's out of season when I ask! Donuts and coffee are good (DD is my favorite anyway) but what keeps bringing me back is the customer service...Omar and Sadik are great! Give this DD a chance and you won't be disappointed!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-10-23,1,"Unbelievably rude... every time I've came here, they've messed up my simple man's order. When I try to politely say, 'hey, I believe there's been a mistake' they just look at me and say nothing, then try to help the next customer. I'm standing there like ""hey guys.. I didn't get any Reese's cups on my ice cream even though I paid for it"" and they REFUSE to even respond or acknowledge me. It's like bizarro world."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-07-12,1,"Very disappointed in the lack of American pride in this establishment. We came on July 4th morning, early, to grab some 4th of July themed donuts and they didn't have any. When asked they answered rudely and with aggression. 

Today I came for ice cream and asked about any holiday donuts for 4th of July, Halloween, Christmas etc and guy behind the counter, with a very defensive and rude tone said no, they don't do that and turned his back. 

Very rude and unfriendly employees.."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-06-19,1,"STAY AWAY! There's another baskin robbins on 42st just a few blocks away. The staff working here should really not be in the customer service industry. They're rude, irrational, and just don't seem to care about their customers at all. Not only did we have terrible customer service, but the two customers ahead of us also had their own issues. How do you provide terrible service to three customers in a row? If that doesn't show that they couldn't give a damn, what does?"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2018-06-08,1,"Came here yesterday morning and was shocked by the lack of professionalism at this place. I asked the cashier a question concerning my order and she answered in a very condescending and annoyed tone of voice for absolutely no reason. I don't understand how can someone whose job is to deal with costumers all day long can be so bad a costumer service. On top of that, the croissant sandwich and chai latte that I ordered wasn't even that good. The cheese on the sandwich was cold and not melted and the chai latte tasted like regular warm milk with no tea in it. Terrible service and terrible food. Overall, this is a terrible place to eat breakfast."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2017-11-30,1,"Horrible place. I went to this location with a simple list of items: a wheat bagel, a creme donut, and 11 more assorted donuts for my company. They snatched the list from my fingers as if I could not read it to them. Then they had no idea what the words wheat nor assorted meant. They could not even read the list. They all had accents and could only talk in half English. After a while of me pointing to what I wanted in the store because they acted like they could not read English, they switched to their native language and cracked a joke at my expense. 
They asked me if i wanted a box for my donuts...?!?!. No i want to carry them in my hands. Such a stupud question.
Then after I received the order, the cashier says, and I quote ""you go now."" What exceptional customer service.

I would highly encourage anyone to go to another Dublin donuts store. They are horrendous. Their service is the worst I've seen in New York. They should not even be open. They don't deserve the one star I put on this website.

If you do go in there, be prepared to point for your food, or, be a linguist.

90,dunkin-new-york-41,2017-08-14,2,"Manager was slow, rude, rudderless, flacid, unfriendly, and had the flattest affect i ever done seen. Never again."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2017-08-06,1,the Employees are so rude and very disrespectful. And got my coffee order wrong. I don't recommend this place at all will never return
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2017-07-09,1,"This is a very convenient store. This is the second time I've walk d in and CNN was blasting lies and fake news about POTUS. 
Shame on you!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2017-04-02,3,"it's too small seating, since it shares with BR, lol 30 degrees better off with soup station
there is no restroom.

the menu is too small text.

the coffee latte was good however, so this is clearly take out for quick coffee"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2017-02-15,1,Really disrespectful and rude employees! I made sure to call ahead requesting a travel mug offer in my DD PERKS. I knew these go quickly so I made sure to confirm that they had the mug available. They told me that it was and that I should come in. After walking a considerable distance I was told that there was no such mug and that I was lying and did not speak to any member of staff on the phone. I asked for the manager and was told that he was not available. I said they should have told me it was not available before I came all the way down to the store and I would be filing a complaint. They said i should go ahead because nothing would happen to them either way. This is what DD has come to.
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2016-07-26,4,"This dunkin donuts is one of my favs. Their always fast in the mornings even when there's a huge crowd. 

The staff is friendly always. And they never run out of my favs like blueberry muffins"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2016-06-06,1,"The service was terrible, Everything I tried to get was wrong.
As someone said, This place WILL NEVER get your order right!

I ordered coffee with milk, but were given coffee without milk. 

I ordered real fruit strawberry smoothie and were given strawberry syrup, when I ask the guy what is it he just said oh we are out of real fruits, so I told him you drink it and give me my money back.
Horrible place. They should get one start just for the location and the outdoor."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2016-05-02,1,"This Dunkin' Donuts has the worst customer service I've ever experienced. They never seem to have enough staff for their morning rush and orders wrong a lot and like to  pawn off other peoples leftovers as fresh food. This morning I ordered 2 hashbrowns and by Magic they  appeared at the counter 30 seconds after I ordered them ( funny thing is I know it takes more then 30 seconds to make two orders of hashbrowns). I asked for a fresh  order and the guy just reheated the two that they tried to give me.  I called him out on it he just smirked, just the worst Dunkin' Donuts."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2016-05-02,1,Ive ordered delivery several times for bkfast and always get 4 chicken biscuits 4 hashbrowns 2 sausage egg cheese crossant and two orange juice which is around $20I called today and the idiot lady made up a price of $32 ridiculous. You could tell they were lieing about the price they just didn't wanna deliver. Then the lady hung up on me.
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2015-12-16,1,"If I could give it negative stars I would!!
This place WILL NEVER get your order right!!  The women taking orders don't listen when you place your order because they're in a big hurry even when no ones in line.  No matter what time of day I visit this location my orders wrong 90% of the time!! According to them black coffee has 15 scoops of sugar and a gallon of cream in it....."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2015-09-12,5,Had the Best service here! The two gentleman working were quick and efficient and so polite!!! Not something you get too often in NYC. Thank you for making my day better.
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2014-03-31,2,"Coffee with GF after getting kicked out of Pio Pio

So yeah...it was raining cats and dogs.
We had to find a place to just chill for a bit since we prematurely got kicked out of Pio Pio (lol well not really we were asked to leave due to other customers waiting).

It's DD coffee. Not like one place makes it better than another.

There was a crackhead lady who came in to converse with the television and a girl that tripped on her Uggs (possibly drunk).

Good times on a Sat night lol"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2013-10-25,4,"I was so thrilled when they opened this place, even though I moved away soon after.  It was great to finally have a DD in walking distance of my home.  

This place was new and fresh when I was going there, so I thought it was great. 

But then, I do like my Dunkin'"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2013-01-11,4,"This is where I always go to pick up birthday ice cream cakes for my boo and her special occasions.

They've always been helpful and friendly, and have no problem decorating cakes for me.  The other location on 34th street made up excuses that their artist wasn't in and there was no way they can write Happy Birthday on a cake.

They also have free wifi and they will also bring your order out to your car if you don't want to risk getting caught.  Just give them a call!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2012-08-03,4,"Compared to most DD locations, this is a good one. Not open 24 hours but still early enough to supply coffee to the troops.

Place was clean, HDTV a nice extra, pastries looked fresh and the java will not disappoint if you like their coffee."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2012-06-15,3,"A nice DD on the west side, even though I think their coffee is kind of crap.  So why three stars?  It's clean, they employees are friendly, and the location is pretty awesome.  The tv is a bonus!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2012-03-04,1,"The service was terrible, Everything we tried to get was wrong. We ordered the reses ice cream but were given something different. We asked for hot chocolate but got mint instead, they told us that a cake we purchased was chocolate when in fact it was strawberry. We had made two separate orders and made this clear when the orders were first placed but they tried to charge both together. It seems that they dont listen to their consumers."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2012-02-24,2,"This place never has soy milk, unlike every other DD in the city.  

The folks who were here are friendly but one of them -- always -- gets my order wrong and I have to wait for her to redo it."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2011-12-23,4,"This is ""MY"" Dunkin Donuts! lol it has flat panels and wi-fi, the staff is very thorough about getting your order correct and to you as fast as possible, I mean it's a dunkin donuts so I'm not going to act as if its a 5 star restaurant but its one of the better dunkin donuts especially design wise! oh yeah and it has outside seating as well!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2011-09-28,5,"Easily one of the best Dunkin Donuts in the city. Their prices are the same as in Queens (much lower than other Manhattan locations), the staff are almost always friendly and to date have not screwed up my order, and they have outdoor seating!! 

The interior is relaxing, with plants, mirrors, plenty of seating, and a big screen hdtv playing CNN. 

Next time you're hanging out on the outer reaches of the solar system (10th ave) and need a caffeine jolt, swing by this gem!"
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2010-11-24,2,"I prefer Starbucks any day. 

If I am too tired in the morning I go across the street to this place. 

Early in the morning there are two dark haired women who just stare at you when you walk in. 

No ""hi, how can I help you""? 

Just a stare. 

Happens every time. 

You have to come in in the afternoon for a ""hi"" apparently. 

But again, in the afternoon when I am not lazy or tired I go to Starbucks."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2010-02-19,4,"I gotta thank Sean K. for putting this up. I Actually was here a few weeks back then looked for the DD, then I was like oh well don't see it. Now it is reviewable, nice pic too of the outside. Yeah this is a cool spot, there are the flat screen televisions here. I actually got something from the baskin robbins ice cream then got a Egg White Flat Turkey to go (for the next morning). I knew I had to be up super early and I would be extra lazy that next day.  Seating area is very nice, I can't complain. Looks like I will pass by when I am in the area."
90,dunkin-new-york-41,2010-02-08,4,"This is, by far the nicest and cleanest DD in Manhattan, at least that I've been to. Nice flat screen TV with plenty of spacious seating. And, of course, my coffee was made perfectly...

Light and sweet."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2020-01-13,4,"The place is clean, nice. Normal Starbucks staff. It's not very big so there are not a lot of seats available."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2019-12-10,5,I work around the corner and love this Starbucks  the staff always friendly and smiling always getting my order on point...
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2019-12-05,1,"Probably the worst Starbucks experience I've ever encountered. 5:30 pm, no decaf coffee available, they don't do pour-over method because they don't have the tools for it. I ended up ordering a pike place and it wasn't even hot! 
Rude staff, terrible coffee. 
Do yourself a favor and go to another location, they're all close enough"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2019-11-04,1,NO BATHROOM I probably wouldn't even give it that for the simple fact they have no bathroom. I ran in to grab those Madeline cookies I love & a tea. I said let me use the bathroom before I get settled I ask about the bathroom & they tell me I have to go to another location. I have never heard of that in a Starbucks.
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2019-08-27,1,Never heard of a coffee shop that has a bathroom but refuses to let customers use it.
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2019-08-22,1,"""no bathroom at this location.""

The only reason we went here was for the bathroom and a little drink along the way. They clearly have a toilet in the back so I don't know why there isn't a sign saying that this Starbucks, unlike most, doesn't have a restroom for people. Is it just me or is the main point of sbux quick caffeine and a place to use the restroom?? They were also very rude in letting us know. The trash is also overflowing like crazy."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2019-08-15,1,"Stopped to grab coffee before a busy day and let's just say, Dominique's shitty attitude and lazy work ethic made for an awful start to the day. She should consider a completely different career or come to realize that ""bitch"" is not a characteristic of someone in customer service"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2019-08-01,1,"5 people behind the counter, 1 person working. Need I really say anymore? That is all."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2019-07-24,2,"Took 15 for minutes for a coffee when there was like 3-4 people in line. It's times square, they should be staffed a bit more to handle that"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2019-01-31,5,"So normally I wouldn't review a chain as big as Starbucks but the employees here are so happy, kind and service oriented that I wanted to give them a shout out. I am from Bend, Oregon and people there are sooo nice all the time so for me to think think this was a standout Starbucks says something. I was visiting from out of town and went here every morning. They were high energy and peppy even though it was a -13 wind chill outside!"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2018-11-29,2,"Who says ""excuse me"" BEFORE running a trash can into your back? A huge asshole that's who. 

They have a really tight space and I get it that whomever has to move the trash around has to move around people standing around buying Starbucks drinks and putting money into this guys paycheck. But this Starbucks has a grade-A asshole working here who probably only has a job because tourists are never coming back."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2018-10-30,1,"Horrible customer service. Went to the Time Square starbucks and they had made my drink wrong for the 3rd time on my trip and I didn't want it to be remade there at that store. So i went to this store and mentioned how the Time Square made my drink wrong and watery( I got a Frappuccino) and they were so rude. The barista just looked at me and said ""So what do you want me to do"". I was appalled. I myself work for starbucks and I've never seen anybody so rude. He proceeded to roll his eyes and tell the other barista to remake my drink. They still made my drink wrong in the end..."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2018-10-27,5,Great place to grab a quick beverage- hot or cold. Good customer attention- especially if you are in a hurry. I'll be back!
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2018-08-25,5,"I never thought I would write a review about a Starbucks but I must tell you that ""Cee"" made my day/night tonight while sitting at the counter. 
Such a rare, random act of kindness and friendliness that is rare indeed. This is the Starbucks to visit (except if you need the loo as theirs is not for customers as a male employer explained because they ""do not have enough seats"" to mandate a public loo). Cee is the employee of the year!"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2018-06-15,2,"Dropped by for a drink while I sit for a while and read after a lot of city walking. Ordered a pink drink. They didn't mention the were out of Strawberries, but okay, no biggie. But then I saw my drink: pretty under-filled and some coconut milk, I think? Disappointing. And not once has someone swept the floor and it NEEDS it."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2018-05-28,2,"Staff are one of the rudest I have ever meet in a Starbucks. They acted like you are bothering them to order a drink. Don't have listen because they are too busy talking/paying attention to others and then ask you to repeat EVERYTHING. Loud obnoxious music playing about strippers and ""big things"", not so great family atmosphere. I thought Starbucks had a music station/collection they played for a relaxing experience while you take a  break to enjoy a cup of expensive coffee? My Son's drink was to be made with caramel and mocha drizzle inside and out of his frap and they forgot the mocha and just dumped a ton on top of the whip. They were out of sweet-n-low. That seems to be a staple for a coffee shop...you know a sweetener!?!?! Overall disappointed in my experience at this location. Looks like they need an adult manager not a kid!"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2018-05-10,1,"Only one person working while everyone stands around not doing anything, did not get everything in my order and was made wrongly."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2018-04-07,1,Hands down the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. Took over 10 minutes to order and then another 10 minutes waiting for not what I ordered. Glad I threw $6 in the trash. Why would you only have 2 people working at this location on a Saturday?
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2018-02-05,2,"The staff is all really nice but every time I come in here they have the most obnoxious music playing. It really kills the entire unwinding experience that I'm looking for. I came here to drink some tea and relax after work, not feel like I'm in a club. It's really annoying. 
There's all older people here unwinding after work I feel. They don't wanna hear this bs. It really is  annoying. And it makes me feel square for talking crap about obnoxious music, but when I come to a coffee pl with the intention of relaxing, it's really annoying to have to contend with this. 
I'm actually leaving now because it's too much."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2018-01-20,1,"Honestly... i dont go to starbucks much as I dont drink coffee but some of my friends enjoy going there for a quick drink or snack and sadly... i regret going to this one... not only was it suchhhhh slowww service(where there was barely anybody even in there soooo why was it slow??) but they also got my the wrong order.... i clearly asked for Hot Chocolate and I have no idea wat I even got... it kinda tasted like coffee but at the same time all I tasted was a burnt flavor nothing else...i drank it as I didnt wanna bother going back up to ask them because I didnt wanna wait another 10-15 mins.... 


Also the lady who is supposedly wraps ur bread? SOOO FREAKING RUDE....im waiting for my drink on the one side as the cashier never told me to wait for my bread at a specific spot....and the cashier told the woman that I ordered a pumpkin bread so later on she comes up to me yelling at me saying CMON LADY I WAS FREAKING RIGHT NEXT TO U LISTEN!!! And she hands me my bread...umm..i heard nobody even calling anything for pumpkin bread as I clearly wouldve went up to u if i did...and u were on the opposite side not next to me =_=. if u were having a bad morning Im sorry but dont get frustrated at the customers when everything is so unorganized... all and all would never go back here again..."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2017-11-25,1,"They HAVE A BATHROOM but NOT FOR PAYING CUSTOMERS after ordering food and drinks and really needing one. These starbuck mofos should put A CLEAR SIGN outside windows like all stores in the neighborhood telling NO PUBLIC BATHROOM.
When u get your $$ from mindless tourists you need no customer service obviously...."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2017-09-03,1,"Didn't think I could have a negative experience at Starbucks. Slow service. I wanted a tall drink they said they didn't have any tall. I don't know if that meant they ran out of cups but generally when I've experienced that they will put less in a bigger cup. I wanted to try a new seasonal drink so I declined incase I wouldn't like it.
Oh and no bathrooms they told my husband and me. Shortly after I heard them directing people to go ""across the street "". Even though I saw bathrooms there."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2017-07-21,5,Naomi is so friendly and amazing and should be promoted ASAP. She really brightened my day :)
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2017-06-10,1,"The worst Starbucks experience I've had in 20 yrs. Service was painfully slow, indifferent and rude despite the fact that it was not particularly busy. Staff seemed to be in their own world and did not acknowledge the chaos they were creating, nor seem to care one iota. Even though it was not crowded we waited more than 10 min to get 3 drinks and 20 min to get the last of our order which they forgot and had to ask for again only to find it was made wrong and had to be remade. The only milk container available was half and half and had to wait to ask for regular milk  which I was given begrudgingly. Store was filthy and cluttered with boxes of unstocked inventory  - a sign used to warn people of a spill was left in traffic despite the fact there was no spill and several people tripped on the sign. I could go on but suffice to say this was truly the Starbucks from hell"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2017-05-14,1,"The worst possible Starbucks experience ever and I don't expect much.
Bathroom is ""across the street ""
My daughter ordered a simple drink that she usually gets and the barrista needed a coworker to explain it. 
My iced coffee barely had any ice"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2017-05-05,1,2:30PM on a Friday. Extremely slow and poorly managed. Waited about twenty minutes for my drink. They should reevaluate their management team here. People just standing around or casually cleaning.
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2017-03-30,1,"I very much dislike the staff at this location. I have worked upstairs for a couple of years and unless I absolutely have no choice then I would stop by for coffee or travelers for my staff. Not a smile is fine. They make you repeat your name as if they could not hear you and mine is a very common American name. Oh, but they sure heard my order. Also, they dislike Asians. They always make our drinks last until the crowd is gone and you are the only one left and late for work. That happened a couple of times. When I finally got my drink, it was a mess. I saw the barista  (tall man), which I really doubt has professional barista certificate filled my entire grande cup  of caramel macchiatto with milk and dumped ice in it, which caused it to overflow. Then he poured a bit out, but immediately I know that's not enough for even one espresso shot. Then it took him another 5 minutes to complete the drink. 2/3 of the cup was milk and ice. The lid was overflowing w espresso when they gave it to me. It dripped all over my hand. I tried to clean it up myself but it continued to overflow. I had to take it back to the barista and said I can't take that to work and drip everywhere. They added an extra cup, poured some out and put on a new lid. How did the caramel macchiatto taste? Bland, because there were too much milk and barely any espresso. That's money wasted, which is ok, but the service is downright racist, disgusting, degrading and nasty. Manager of this place needs to inspect and train staff thoroughly. Apron and clothes on the barista were very soiled. No gloves and I didn't enjoy sneezing and coughing on hand and touching my cup. And the tables are always filthy."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2017-02-07,5,"Stephanie Made THE BEST BUTTERSCOTCH LATTE Y'ALL! GO see her! SAT at this location waiting on out of town guests and felt like home! They treated us with care! 

Richie kept the place looking spic and span.....I'm just full of gratitude when it comes to hard workers and people who are positive and love life .....And when the job reflects it, I can not ignore it"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2016-11-28,1,Stopped by for coffee.  Not a  smile when ordering.  Bareistra singing which was OK.  .  They probably should spend time cleaning.   Gross.
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2016-11-13,5,Amazing staff. Stopped in for veterans day free coffee. The coffee was splendid and the place was very clean
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2016-10-29,1,"This is the absolute worse Starbucks location ever!!! They do not make the drinks in the sequence that people place their orders in.  Instead, they make drinks in whatever order is easiest for the store associate.  I was 2nd on a line of ten people but last to get my Berry Sangria drink??!!!!"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2016-07-16,1,"Rude. I ordered a small Iced Americano and the people who came after me received their orders first. I waited 15 minutes standing there, expecting to see if they were making my coffee, but NO. The workers here obviously have no respect for customers. I paid $2.69 for my drink, and it was a waste. I went out the door, and will never come back to this place. I've never seen Starbucks behave this way. I hope not all Starbucks are turning down like this. I honestly don't have any rating stars to give here, but Yelp requires to do so, so here is one star."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2016-07-08,4,"I'm a huge Starbucks fan- I've tried other coffee places, but I love Starbucks. This location was clean, the staff was very friendly, and there weren't any lines. A great place to stop by and get a caffeine boost to enhance your day on the town!"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2016-05-16,1,"I hate that this store is inconsistent with their hours. One day close at 11pm the next is 15 after 10. I work accross the street so this is the closest store to me and i live off my Starbucks app so I tend to use it to  order and pay. One night I had a pre paid and went to go pick up my order before work, but of course they were closed @1038pm even though the site said open till 11pm. So I sat knocking on the door because I had already paid. Finally 15mins later one of the barista acknowledged me, even though he looked at me standing there the whole time. He eventually made my drink, but it's just crazy that every night they close wherever they want and make u feel like ur the inconvenience.The simplest solution would be to just post the hours on the door save them time. Some of the staff is great but they just tend to do whatever they want at the customers expense."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2016-03-18,1,"I wish I could give a lower rating as it doesn't even deserve a 1 star  we stopped in hear for a coffee an a sandwich before the st Patrick's day parade. We had the unfortunate encounter with an extremely ignorant man working at the till he was a bald white male that thought making us fell stupid was funny. He yelled at my elderly father that is 62 and from Ireland so not used to Starbucks to hurry up with his order, he also shouted at us and laughed with his co worker because he shouted and embarrassed us. I no a job is a job but for someone working in Starbucks to try a belittle some one is a bit rich"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2015-12-30,2,"I was very pleased with my drink, however the customer service was a different story. The workers were unenthusiastic, with one barista complaining in front of customers about how tired she was. Also, my father ordered a coffee frappacino, and it was basically white there was so little coffee in it."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2015-12-21,2,"This is by far the worst experience I have had at a Starbucks. We went right before a show, and although it appeared busy, there was only one person ahead of us in line. Then I got barked at by 2 different baristas trying to help me with the same order. It was the worst possible way to take an order. I would look at one, say what I wanted, repeat it. Look at another, tell him something, then the other one would get snappy and look at me like I was dumb. Not enjoyable.

I got a small donut and my usual hot chocolate with caramel instead of vanilla. It took at least 10 minutes to come out. They had 2 baristas working and 2 idling around at the cash register. Nobody thought ""hey we're way backed up, let me get off the not busy register!"" The lady next to me wasn't happy as they basically forgot to make her drink. My hot chocolate was horrid. Something tasted way off. 

Stay away. Please do yourself a favor and go to another Starbucks."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2015-11-28,5,"Starbucks is Starbucks, right? No, actually not. Some are very well run, some not so much. Every time I've been in this store, despite how busy it is; it's clean and well sorted out. Some SBUX, the area where you add cream/sugar is a mess; with sugar and used stirrers everywhere, and the half/half container chronically empty. Not so this location."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2015-10-25,1,The dude got pissed off because I asked him to ring up the order separately. They wanted me to place the order through the app. I wanted my stars for gold card readers. Suck it
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2015-10-06,3,"Love this spot for coffee before or after a show. Today ordered food and after paying for a salad, was told they ""don't have forks here"" and handed a spoon. It's not really a ""spoon food,"" but it tasted good. Hopefully they will decide to start stocking forks."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2015-08-26,4,"I am not a big fan of Starbucks.  First, I think their coffee is too strong and tastes burnt.  Second, I think their prices are too high.  Finally, the customers are not the same as the Dunkin' Donuts crowd (take that however you'd like).
After having said all of the above, a friend recommended I try a vanilla bean frappuccino.  He swore it's worth the $342.78 price tag.  I happened to be in the mood for a frosty non-alcoholic beverage and decided to give it a try.  To my surprise, it was refreshingly insanely good.  I had to control myself to avoid a brain freeze.
I thoroughly enjoyed it and might even return to Starbucks one day after I pay off my credit card.  I gave it 4 stars because I could not bring myself to give Starbucks a perfect score......but it was close.  Damn you Starbucks!"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2015-07-31,5,The Quick: Had the best experience with a fantastic barista (barista for a man?) today. The service was really outstanding; he made a line full of rush hour manhattan snobs smile and was extremely efficient. Thank you!
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2015-07-08,3,"Lines move quick in the morning but sometimes it takes a while to get your drink after offrring. Lots of tourists during the day. If you can walk to a different one, do it!"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2015-05-30,3,"Typical gentrifying chain layout and what you would expect. 
This particular location had a homeless guy that hangs out all day and the smell is so bad I'm on the verge of gagging. Staff sadly says there's nothing they can do."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2015-05-27,4,"My peach green tea lemonade is bomb! So yummy. You gotta try it guys. Anyway, this place is a good rest spot to chill, freshen up, and get a drink while you're in the city. The staff were pretty nice. Just your average Starbucks around 4 pm I guess. ^_^"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2015-05-14,2,"This Starbucks location is the absolute worst that I have been to, ever. Worst Starbucks location in all of Hell's Kitchen at the very least, in my experience.

Staff is not happy there - it's apparent that they despise tourists who seem to take longer to order anything and are unfamiliar with US Currency when they are paying in cash.

The milk was out without a thermos. EEW, no thank you!

I am going to go to the one on 49th Street between 8th and 9th or the one on 49th and 9th from now on."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2014-10-04,2,Friendly Staff but I love Vanilla Lattes and was in dire need of one each of the 2 times I came here. Both times the drink was not up to standard because they missed the in vanilla syrup and it tasted like a regular latte :(
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2014-05-13,4,"There is nothing particularly special about this Starbucks location except for it is opened until late. This is really great when you are arriving to New York City's airport and want a coffee before retiring for the night.

I love New York City for that reason and I wish Los Angeles or other major cities would have establishments open 24 hours a day like this particular Starbucks."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2014-02-24,3,"Mr was looking for some NYC mugs to bring back to coworkers & the SBux at the other corner - 'cause yes, there's one on every corner - was all kinds to packed... but this location was a little more calm

Have to say I an NOT a fan of their new mug designs - why did you have to change the Collectible Mug designs?!  :-(

So out of desperation & given the fact his coworkers collect these SBux mugs, the Mr got 1 of each design & we decided while we were there, might as well take advantage of their free facilities

Restrooms were okay & even though it's unisex & there was a long line, we found it was clean.....which says a lot given the swarms of customers who are constantly in & out the place

By the time we were leaving, the coffee line was literally out the door & looked just Ike its neighbor down the corner - guess we lucked into a slow patch!"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2013-11-20,2,"First time I've met moody baristas at starbucks - tried to use a code for the first time which they mentioned was expired even if the email I handed them clearly stated the expiration date and that was the first time getting coffee today...also messed up my order :(

Was offset by my best friend being in town!"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2013-03-10,3,"Yes, it's a Starbucks. It's also handy to my gym, and I often indulge myself in hot chocolate after a workout. There are three or four other Starbucks locations between my gym and the subway, and I keep coming back to this one, because they seem to do things a little better. (Or maybe it's that the other places are sloppy.)

Most of the baristas know I'll want whipped cream on my hot chocolate, but the point is that if they don't know, they ask. At other branches, I've specified that I do want whipped cream, taken the lid off the drink they hand me, and had to give it back.

Downside: it's a tiny location in a busy neighborhood, with no actual tables, just some counters with stools; if you want a place to settle in with a laptop or for a conversation, this isn't it."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2012-11-21,2,"Had a terrible experience with a barista at this starbucks. Plain rude and not too helpful.
Excruciatingly painful slow service. Guys, speed it up, you're in New York, GDI, people have things they need to run to and do.
Jeezus"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2012-09-30,2,"This has to be hands down one of the slowest Starbucks I have ever been to.  Everyone was very nice, just very, very, very, very slow.  I was about 5th in queue when I arrived at about 10:30am , and left 20 min later with my grande skim latte with a much bigger line waiting. 

Good thing the smooth jazz in there will keep you mellow while waiting."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2012-09-10,2,"I was so thrilled to have Starbucks in NYC. I was happy after an awesome night sleep on an amazing bed (see my review of The Milford), however I got inside this Starbucks and the good mood vanished immediately. 

It's early September and the weather is hot and muggy. Well, somehow, inside this Starbucks, the weather was HOTTER and MUGGIER than outside!!! 

Obviously there AC was not working. I'm hoping this was just a temporary issue, but OH did it make for a HORRIBLE NYC Starbucks experience. 

Also, the baristas were having trouble with my order, which is fairly simple. Venti iced coffee sweetened with vanilla and half & half (I know I could've asked for room and poured the half&half myself at the bar, but I honestly just wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible). I had to repeat it like 10 times."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2012-08-28,5,"By far my favorite Starbucks in the city. (and that's big, considering there's a million of them) I work down the block, and grab my caffeine fix almost daily. All of the baristas there are super quick, friendly, and efficient. And most of them take the time to actually remember you and what you drink. (a big plus) This location is so much better than the one down the street on Broadway (you can check out my other review after I got fed up with waiting 13 minutes for one drink at the Broadway location-i guess that's what I get for cheating on my fave Starbucks people) So thank you, 47th n 8th Starbucks employees. You help me get through my day! And ill never cheat again :)"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2012-05-14,5,This Starbucks location has some great employees and quick service. Never been disappointed
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2012-04-13,3,"Theater District inconclusive bears a Starbucks... big a-ok.  Store #2785.

On a Monday night pre-theatre dinner engulfed a day's old sandwich of turkey and Swiss at $5.75, yet it gets the job done.  The line moves moderately with theatre crowd and tourists alike."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2012-01-05,2,"I dont know if management changed, but the staff is a mess.  They are too busy chit chatting with eachother to get anything done.  Ill go across the street from now on!"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2011-11-28,3,"Nice starbucks, but unfortunately, not enough seating. And just like someone else mentioned, the staff is very chatty and noisy.

I'm giving it 3 stars because Starbucks still has the best coffee!"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2011-09-08,4,"People are nice & one of the cleaner Starbucks in the city... But limited seating so if ur looking for a place to sit down for a bit, goto the one on 49th & 8th"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2011-05-10,3,"An anonymous Starbucks in Times Square hurriedly serving mediocre flavored caffeine, one of many. I walked in to get a breakfast wrap and an Americano. The breakfast wrap looked and tasted like salty spinach mush and eggwhite in soggy wrap bread. However, for $3.25, 280 calories, and in under 5 minutes, I'll take it. 

The staff attitude can best be described as wind-up robot courteous."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2011-05-01,3,"Ambitious Day off Starbucks. It's a half block further then my Lazy Day off Starbucks. 
This is the friendliest Starbucks in town. It has good seating as well. Pleanty of pulic seating out side."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2011-04-28,4,"Convenient location, nice baristas for the most part....my only pet peeve is there's not as many seats as I would like but I haven't had any problems here other than that."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2011-03-04,4,"It's a Starbucks. I'm a fan for that alone.

However, the kicker to this place was that the staff was chatting their business quite loudly amongst themselves. It was like theater! The woman who was obviously the manager was sweet and got our coffees out pronto. But the side-eye she gave one of her staff, when they came late and expected a smoke break.... Woooooooo HOO! I should have given her a extra tip for that.

Anyway, lots of seeting, a long bar, several tables and cushy chairs."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2010-12-10,3,"Killing time during my daughter's auditions...this was a nice Starbucks to get a big cup of tea at and sit and read my book. It was slightly nicer than a lot of other Starbucks and I am okay with that.
Boo to the guy who grabbed the chair at my table without even asking me if someone was coming...just because you have on an expensive suit doesn't mean you can be a dick."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2010-11-08,4,"This is the best Starbucks I've been to!  As other reviewers have noted, it combines the vibe of a neighborhood cafe with the consistency of the Starbucks chain.  The lines look long but move along efficiently.  They take your drink order before you get to the cashier so that the wait for your drink after you've paid is not as long.  Everyone who works here is energetic, friendly and accomodating (to quirky drink requests)."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2010-11-05,3,"normal starbucks..not that much seating but Ive easily found seating while I have been there. I don't like how in the morning its gets super crowded, but by the evening its easy to find somewhere to sit. The employees here are really nice and they pay attention to what you want on your drink..for me it was whip cream and they def put a lot on before I asked when they overheard me talking to someone in the line. :)"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2010-10-05,4,"Rainy day in the city. Stopped by to warm up a bit and get a caramel macchiato. 

Lines were not that long and employees very friendly. They made us laugh abit. Service was quick! 

It is a bit small and people standing around waiting for people to leave so they can have a seat. 

There is one restroom for men and women. 

Over all it was clean and a nice little cozy place."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2010-09-21,4,"My first stop at 5am after just arriving in NYC!  It's clean, friendly, well run.  I was fortunate to find an outlet to recharge my dead cell phone (a travel nightmare).    

The staff was nice, helpful ( gave me lots of info regarding where I was, wanted to go, etc.) But best of all, my Venti, Soy Latte with 2 pumps sugar-free vanilla & 2 splenda was awesome.  Plus, I met a new friend here!    

I heart NYC! xxoo"
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2010-07-25,4,"Pluses: 

It's not nearly as crowded as its SB neighbors (on 42nd Street next to the Regal Theater, and in the middle of Times Square).

The bathroom is suprisingly clean considering the high-traffic nature of the area.

The staff is friendly, chatty even.  Not even close to burnt-out.

In a nutshell, this would be my choice for a Starbucks in the area.

A minus or two:

ONE outlet.  When I went, a young lady was using both plugs (for her laptop and her Blackberry), and she had an empty Vitamin Water bottle on the table.  That's it.

Not a huge space, so not many tables or chairs.  They had to get creative with the seating, too.  My table was set up against what I guess was meant to be a second door, so I had this constant flow of people trying to exit the place through me."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2010-07-12,4,"I know, I can't believe it either, 4 stars to a Starbucks? But, I live close by so it's convenient and it's clean. The line can get long in the afternoon but I tend to go in the morning to grab my beloved latte before heading to school or work, and the staff are nice."
91,starbucks-new-york-342,2010-02-15,5,"What, no reviews? This Starbucks is pure win. It is a long block away from the one on 47th/Broadway and entirely worth the 4min it takes to get from one to the other. More space, less people, and incredibly nice baristas. Even though I don't come in every day, there is more than one person there that remembers my order :) It's a level of thoughtfulness that I never expect, but always so nice when it happens!

That is the real reason why i'm giving 5 stars here, even though the neighboring Bux does set a really low bar to beat. That one is small and usually jammed with confused tourists who don't know what to order. I feel bad for their baristas because even though they try to be nice, they always seem a little harried (understandably) and it must really suck to work there. But I digress. The Bux that this review is written for is the best around.

PS Before I get knocked for giving a 5 to an evil Starbucks, let me just clarify that I have as much appreciation for the local and/or gourmet indie coffee shop as the next person. But funny thing, this Bux almost feels like one because it's run so well. Admittedly, the coffee is still nothing-special bux, but that's expected. I can be happy drinking crappy diner coffee, too, as long as it's in the right context."
92,dunkin-new-york-61,2018-12-04,3,"Close to the nyu hospital.  Towards the end of the day, the coffee doesn't taste as good."
92,dunkin-new-york-61,2018-05-12,3,"I frequent this Dunkin as it's in right near my work and a good place to stop along the way. Usually come in around 930 on the dot and if there's a line it moves quickly. What makes me really annoyed about Dunkin, not just this one in particular, is the fact that they charge $.25 for almond milk. If I'm getting an almond latte (does Dunkin even do those) then charge me 25 cents but when I come in for a medium coffee and ask for a drop in my coffee, literally a drop, asking for 1 tsp. of almond milk here, don't charge me 25 cents. One of the reasons why people go to Dunkin is because it's decent coffee for a decent price. Start charging me 25 cents for 1 tsp. of almond milk, it's just kind of offensive. Almost as offensive as the sign they have in there with a time limit of how long you're allowed to stay and sit. They have some high top seating along the window in the back and maybe five other tables or so in the seating area with a big sign making sure you know you're welcome to sit, but don't get too comfortable. This is not the place to bring a book and relax, it is not a place to bring your laptop and get work done. That shouldn't come as a surprise though, Dunkin isn't cozy or warm and definitely isn't the place I'd want to post up in for longer than 15 minutes. Their bathroom is nasty and there's little quiet with the constant hustle of people in and out. Get your coffee and go and BYOAM. (Bring your own almond milk.)"
92,dunkin-new-york-61,2017-06-13,4,Great place to spend time with your friends . The staff is welcoming and very pleasant . Chocolate donuts taste absolutely sensational. Highly recommended!
92,dunkin-new-york-61,2017-03-29,5,I come here M-F for my morning coffee. Love SABINA behind the counter as she is super competent and friendly. Thanks for always being on point Sabina and making awesome coffee. They are open all hours so its super convenient to come here.
92,dunkin-new-york-61,2017-03-04,3,a ok dd that has baskin robbins as well. on the corner of 33rd st and 2nd ave in the kips bay section near nyu medical center so you will see folks in medical scrubs inside grabbing a donut and coffee. a small area with tables to sit but it's mostly orders to go. i usually grab a few dozen donuts and a few containers of joe when i am doing my good deed with volunteering . the dd staff are always friendly and keep the place clean and well stocked which is important when you are open 24/7. during the summer time in the evening after i finish visiting nyu med  i usually grab some pralines n cream ice cream for my journey home.
92,dunkin-new-york-61,2017-01-31,3,A-OK place just like any other Dunkin' Donuts across the US. Similar service and product offering as any standard Dunkin' Donuts.
92,dunkin-new-york-61,2016-12-27,1,"Rude manager!  I was given a holiday gift - 2 boxes of French Vanilla K-cups.  I went to exchange them for original because I don't drink flavored coffee.  The manager argued with me that what I received is not from his store. LMAO - there were boxes of these K-cups on his shelves.  After his rudeness - I went to another local DD on 34th Street.  The manager happily took the 2 boxes of French Vanilla back, let me take original blend AND because he was so nice I spent extra money in the store.  Why patronize and give your money to nasty people when you don't have to?"
92,dunkin-new-york-61,2016-08-26,5,always on point w/ fresh coffee. love DD especially in NYC!
92,dunkin-new-york-61,2016-08-08,5,"Pretty good Dunkin' Donuts location and conveniently near the inn where I stayed in Summer 2016. Food is good, from donuts to bagels. Didn't use their dining area, but seems like the whole place is clean and organized, for the most part. Staff are friendly and have good customer service."
92,dunkin-new-york-61,2016-07-28,5,Great customer service. Don't come to this location alot but rather go here when I am in the area and need to get to NYU medical center.
92,dunkin-new-york-61,2014-11-04,5,"This is my go to DD by my job. The staff is quick and always makes my coffee correct.  Even during the high morning traffic I never have to wait a long time to time.  In & out! 
This location is also a Baskin Robbins. They have recently remodeled and have a small clean sitting area."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2020-02-24,1,"The point of ordering on line is to not wait for service. But it seems each time I order, 10min prior mind you, it's either never ready or worst, incorrect. Just now I order a simple pike. Not only I had to wait an extra 5min, but the cup was sitting behind the counter while staff is goofing off on each other. I played dumb and asked if the online was working. One says yes and the other says, Oh his coffee is right there, give it to him. No apologies. Just..here. smdh. This location sucks"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2020-02-18,4,"I've been coming to this location for about a month and usually on a weekday, during afternoons. There's no major wait usually, quick service. There location is super convenient,  as its literally right next to the train station and across the street from a Equinox gym/spa location. And the nearest campus is Hunter college. So there can be a lot of foot traffic, depending on the time you visit. 

Theres two large square wooden tables, with comfortable day bed like seating areas by the store front windows (with mini tables attached to the walls) they look super comfy and inviting. 
However, I've only noticed 3 to 4 charging outlets, and it's pretty loud due to the music volume here (for those that wants a quiet study place, this isnt it.)

The staff here, they're efficient because this is Manhattan, fast pace required. They're not always as friendly, smiley, or personable; unlike some other locations I've been to.

There is free wifi, and the customer service hotline will always take care of their customers if the store experience was less than adequate.

Lastly, the new red velvet pound cake, was too sweet for my liking, especially the icing....like biting into diabetes....drowning in sugar........"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2020-01-18,5,"BEST. STARBUCKS. ON. THE. UPPER. EAST. SIDE!
Thank you Lu, Will, Princess, Julian, For always making it right for me don't remember a lot of names but this whole team has the superb customer service skills to make you come back!"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2019-08-08,2,"-First Impression- Starbucks is Starbucks is Starbucks, right...? Not really

-Service- The employees at this store seems nice enough. It's a small location, but seemed understaffed (only one person making drinks at the time I ordered)

-Price- Typical Starbucks pricing

-Did Not Like- For one, it was not very clean. There wer straw wrappers on the floor, crumbs and sticky spots on the tables, and the trash bins were full to the top. Secondly, there was a man sleeping at one of the tables. It didn't appear that he had ordered anything, maybe he did before I waked in, I don't know, but in a place with such limited seating, it's pretty annoying for someone to be fully asleep in a booth when you're looking for a place to sit. And no, the staff didn't say anything to him. 

-Noteworthy- N/A

-Recommended?- Sorry, but no."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2019-07-05,2,"Jessica (if that is even her name) should not be a barrista at Starbucks. She is downright LAZY and won't bother to shake the iced macha. A few weeks ago, I ordered an iced macha tea and she simply dumped the powder in the cups and turned the cups upside down once, causing a fine mess dripping outside the lids. She did exactly the same thing last week when I ordered 4 iced macha teas to bring to work. I mentioned it and she made me feel so uncomfortable. What a bully!  Her method is not sufficient to dissolve the powder and leaves clumps at the bottom of the cup. Today, I went again and thanked her colleague for making it the right way. She evidently overheard me and turned around to argue that she is not obliged to shake the drink. Meanwhile, I have been consuming this drink since inception at least 7 different locations and EVERY SINGLE BARRISTA SHAKES THE DRINK!  Not only is Jessica lazy, but she has a serious chip on her shoulder, like she doesn't like certain people, if you get my drift. She is a miserable human being who clearly hates what she is doing . She should not be dealing with the public. A lazy bully should not be exposed to your clientele. She should be spoken to. If it is a fake name she gave, I am sure that some of her colleagues will tell you who she is as they witnessed on 3 occasions her refusal to make the drink right, even apologizing to me. In the grand scheme of your income, you probably don't really care about this one complaint, not am I one to lodge complaints, but this person is deplorable. Disgusting!"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2019-05-15,2,"Barista was nice and my drink was made accurately. However, my friend ordered a drink with soy milk. When she told another barista that it had whole milk, she snatched it from her hand and went to replace it without another word.  A little rude, but at least she went to fix it."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2019-05-13,1,"Very very noisy very loud depressing rap music and the staff holding conversations from either side of the counter having to shout because the music is so loud, not relaxing!"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2018-12-21,2,"I come here pretty much every morning, I'm never satisfied. The to go orders are always priority, time after time my coffee has uncooked coffee beans at the bottom, and it takes them 15min to heat up one morning bun. (Mind you, there's usually just one to two others on line) 

I will give it two stars because I'm lucky enough to get a pleasant barista. Once they see me waiting there for awhile they get on it.  

Also the coffee is usually burnt, unfortunately...."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2018-10-30,1,"I come here every other day. People who work here are rude, disrespectful.

93,starbucks-new-york-268,2018-09-26,1,Got my order wrong and lied to me about it. Horrible service.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2018-08-16,2,I ordered a grande strawberry açaí with light ice and the barista didn't read the order carefully and he put a bunch of ice into the shaker and when he was pouring the drink into my cup he then realized that I asked for light ice. He just poured the drink into my cup knowing that it was only 3/4 filled without all the ice. He didn't even bother adding more of the strawberry juice into the cup to fill it up. I had to say something to another barista telling him that the cup isn't even filled. Excuse my language but I paid for a full cup of drink and not for 3/4 cup of drink with a shitload of ice... the barista who took care of my order didn't even give a shit. Very unsatisfied with the service.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2018-08-03,2,"It's open until 11 pm which is a plus but the service here is not great.  The staff seem frustrated with life and annoyed with having to take orders.  It is a chain so yes, expectations have to be managed BUT even taking that into consideration, the eye rolls is not acceptable.  

The drinks themselves are pretty standard and my frappuccinos are always up to expectations.  There are much better locations."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2018-03-01,3,"Efficient, and open late when compared to other Starbucks! Open till 11PM is always a plus. The inside is PACKED during the day and usually around 1-3pm there's no place to sit in side. When it's crowded staff moves slowly with IDGF mentality but for the most part my drinks are usually good and they keep the line moving."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2018-01-11,1,"Worse than rock center. Waited 30 minutes for my mobile order this morning. After 15 minutes when myself and another girl asked about our orders the barista didn't seem to care at all. She looked at our orders on our phones and went back to making coffee.  When after 20 minutes of waiting, i asked if she was going make our coffees. She made the other girls and not mine. So after she made a few more and I asked if she was going to make mine and I was already late for work at this point. She finally made it after I asked several times and it was wrong to boot. Avoid this Starbucks."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2017-12-17,4,"i enjoyed my early sunday visit as i waited for my buddy to pick me up for our journey to white plains and starbucks is a safe bet if you have time waste .the location is lexington ave and 63rd st steps from the mta train station so if you need your coffee fix before heading to work or play you are in luck . not the biggest bucky around but space is use wisely with a giant communal table, some counter seating by front window and stool counter space in back . i like the art paintings on wall which is better then the bland art at some other starbucks . the place is clean and organized which includes the condiment counter which is fully stocked with sugar. straws, napkins, etc and the eats display is set up in a way that you can see what's available pronto , the blueberry muffin and lemon pound cake was steering me in that direction and some decaff cappy also. for a smaller size starbucks i must say that's it spacious in a cozy way , less folks and more space with fast wifi is cool with me. my ride is here so this review is over .4 stars on my yelp meter ."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2017-11-14,1,You never get what you ask for. Wet cappuccino means dry every friggin time unless you check. Speed more important than accuracy. The chocolate croissant is worse than if Dunklin Donuts made it. God awful. Pass.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2017-07-07,4,"I go to a few locations near this one but this one is definitely my favorite. The staff here are friendly and attentive - when they're out of something, they make personal recommendations which I like. The only down side is sometimes it gets too busy to where you're ignored."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2017-04-26,1,"Awful service. Rude staff. It was almost as if they were doing me a huge favor by serving me. Then the coffee machine had an issue. 10 minutes later, I asked how much longer? Uh-oh.....bad move on my part. Unreal. Avoid. Two thumbs down"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2017-04-21,3,This starbucks is more of a To-Go Starbucks. No bathroom and not quiet for reading or studying
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2017-04-06,3,im unhappy with this store，waiting so long about 15 minutes and just order a bagel.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2017-03-30,4,"I usually like this location and never had any complaints. The baristas are all really nice and efficient but the reason why I wanted to make a review was because this time, although she was nice, the barista who took my order seemed distracted so made my iced order into hot and I had to wait a little bit which wasn't a big deal. But when I got my order, it was a little warm as if they had put in ice but everything was so hot all the ice immediately melted! I didn't want to wait again for my order to be fixed but it tastes or just feels funny having an iced drink with no ice and is lukewarm.

But on the plus side, there's a lot of spacious seating and even some cushions by the window like it's a little nook!"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2017-02-27,5,"I head to this Starbucks everyday and is the ONLY Starbucks I will give 5 stars to. The staff is super friendly and the place is clean and stocked with goodies. Just like most Starbucks, it does get crowded but all you need is a little bit of patience :)"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2016-12-30,5,It's small but the staff appears friendly. It's not too far from Bloomingdale's so it's great after shopping.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2016-12-07,1,I don't know if this is a new Starbucks thing or just this location but they barely put in whip cream as they used to! I just got a hot chocolate and it has the smallest bit of whip cream which is unacceptable for a $4 hot chocolate. If I didn't want whip cream I would have asked for it. What was the point of the barista asking if I wanted whip if they wouldn't really give me anyway?...The hot chocolate itself is a bit watered down. What the heck! It has always been such a stable beverage.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2016-11-17,5,"This Starbucks is amazing!!!!!!!!!! The service is what makes it so amazing. Close to all of the different Starbucks locations have the same drinks and they taste the same- so I would say that they are mostly judged by customer service.

I have been going here for over 3 years, and I have not had a complaint yet. All the employees are great (very nice) and they really are quick workers. When there is a long line, I know that it'll pass in a matter of seconds, and food and drinks are always received. I recommend this location to every New Yorker who is impatient (like me haha)!"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2016-10-25,5,It's been about 3 months from my last review. This store has amazing quality control and service. The baristas are really quick so don't worry about the long lines in the morning. 100% satisfied. :)
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2016-10-06,2,I ordered a small green tea latte and it came half full. Size small is pretty small already. Why did they even make it half full? It's almost like a sample drink that I had to pay for it. Just totally absurd.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2016-09-28,3,"Just dropped in here to pick up some iced coffee to get a caffeine rush while heading to the subway. Had to have a good buzz going on to shop at the Queens Center Mall.

Pretty basic location. Normal menu of drinks and eats as in all of them. Free wifi. Efficient service. Bathroom. Kind of a narrow layout with some seating. Nice looking spot though. Already pushing that Pumpkin Spice!

Bottom line, it's a Starbucks. The Borg of coffee houses. Resistance is futile."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2016-09-23,5,Constantly and consistently amazing service. People that truly love and enjoy what they do and it's refreshing to see. I've come here at all times of day and everyday of the week and I've always been satisfied with my order and the service behind it. Best Starbucks on the this side!
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2016-07-30,1,"Really rude employees. Mobile ordered a drink in the morning and they got it wrong; came in the afternoon, ordered in person, and they got it wrong again and were extremely rude when I asked them to make it again. So rude that I simply asked for a refund and went to a different Starbucks. Absolutely disgusting behavior."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2016-07-17,4,"I stop here most days to pick up breakfast on my way to the 4,5,6 train. Most of the time the staff is quick and friendly but I've had some who aren't as nice. I hate the fact that every time I ask for a bakery item, the staff asks whether I want it heated to which I reply no. But when I receive it, it's piping hot. Stop heating my muffin!! I'm always in a rush so I can't make a complaint or grab another but it's quite annoying. Otherwise, it's a cool spot and I continue to visit daily."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2016-07-13,3,"Generally efficient - the line to order moves fast in the morning before 9am. However, waiting for a drink (even one that is easy to make - iced coffee, unsweetened, light ice) still takes longer than it would at Dunkin Donuts."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2016-06-19,1,"Horrible customer service!! Staff is super unfriendly and they apparently setting up their own working hours . Walked in at 9.45 pm
and was refused service just because supervisor lady decided that they close early on that day for absolutely no reason . Outrageous !"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2015-09-03,5,"Skinny ice caramel macchiato 2nd cup of the morning


Yup it's that kind of day!!!!


COFFEE"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2015-08-12,2,"Lack of seating. 

I ordered a sandwich and ate it standing up. There's like a 10 foot table with 7 steel chairs. 3 stools over by where they wait for their drinks. - All filled with  electronic junkies. 

Idk what's up with these two giant radiator things on both sides of the sugar/milk station."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2015-07-22,3,"I had the hibiscus refresher because they were out of the other one. It was well-made, and wasn't too sweet. I actually came to do work because there are surprisingly few coffee shops open past 8pm on the Upper East Side. This place is open until 11pm, has some outlets, and a communal table that's well-lit. This will likely be my staple late-night working area."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2015-06-26,2,"This starbucks is the worst!!! I order drinks with soymilk but they never remember to make it with soy. Even with the label printed out, they don't read the special requests. The only thing they read is the name of the drink. I work very close to this starbucks, so I use this starbucks a lot but seriously...they make mistakes everytime!! Not once they gave me a correct drink. What is so hard to just add soymilk?? It's not like I asked for tons of requests!! Besides the order mistakes, they also upset me with insuffient amount of frappuccino. They NEVER fill it up!! I pay for a grande size and what I get is a drink in between tall and grande. That's what gets me even more upsetting bcuz it's an ambiguous amount that I cannot even complain about. As a matter of fact, it's almost a tall sized amount when I hit the bottom of the cup on the table and let the ice leveled straight. Complaining would just make me a nasty customer and I wouldn't want them to remake the drink..don't like slaving people around. The attitude of the staffs are okay however. And that's another reason why I can't complain....  Argh this SB stresses me out but having no choice stresses me out even more.."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2015-06-13,3,Small yet busy site. The baristas are swift with order turnover but the space doesn't feel cozy... It's definitely more of a pit stop for snacks.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2015-05-08,4,"I have been here many times and John makes the best drinks in my opinion. Very sad that they don't have blackberry mojito this year. Being said that, they recommend me the peach tea lemonade in replace of my bmtl. It was decent. Staff is friendly. Line moved really quick today even when John was the only one making drinks. Will definitely be back!"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2015-01-16,3,Coffee is good......but I need a second job to afford it.  I'd rather go to corner and get just as good coffee from the nice guy who stands outside all day for a dollar.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2014-11-24,4,"Very above average Starbucks experience - both registers were staffed with highly competent people, efficient; work spaces and bars were above average clean and well- stocked; barista was on top of her game; line moved swiftly; appropriate level of staff for late morning on a Monday in November"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2014-11-02,3,"The staff at this SB and most other SBs I've been to is usually very good to me. What occurred on this occasion was so SIC that I'm using this opportunity to correct said injustice. Okay okay I'm joking, it really wasn't that serious but I do think it's a story with a tip to share with fellow Customer Service Representatives. 

I in no way subscribe to ""the customer is always right"" arseness. Hell no! But I'm quick to apologize to a customer even when I'm far from wrong. To me once you're not disrespectful, I am able to keep on my professional coat. 

Each weekend of almost 9 months I've ordered a small coffee and a peppermint latte, a slice of banana bread and a croissant from this SB. 
On this particular morning it seemed to be even more crowded but I was finally able to place my order.

I got my pike and  breads and waited for my latte. And waited. And waited then inquired about it. They kept asking customers about a ""chai tea chai tea"" but as I never ordered a chai in life I paid it no mind. 

The server realize that the cashier mistakenly cashed the wrong drink and told him what I really ordered. Instead of a polite smile or even a shrug of apology. Mr. Cashier went into a hissy fit telling the server ""SHE ORDERED A WARM CHAI TEA and she stressed on the WARM""

I automatically thought maybe I made a mistake. But NO, how could I when I never ordered whatever chai is in my life!?

Short story, sometimes winning"" isn't all it's cracked out to be. Your customers aren't in competition with you. All we want is prompt (in this case), good service, and good food/product. 

The End."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2014-10-24,3,Right outside of the 63th Street/Lexington subway station so I'll usually run in for a quick coffee before heading downtown.  Line moves pretty quickly and the seating area is always packed so good luck getting a seat.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2014-10-11,5,This Starbucks is a power house! In and out with my Grande Pike on a weekday morning in under two minutes!
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2014-09-08,3,"I mean, it's a Starbucks so there's only a couple things you really need to know. Unfortunately I didn't use the bathroom, so no comments on that -- other than the huge line I saw for it.

1. Seating - There is one of those large computer tables that seats eight. There's also two cushion ""seats"" by the window and a couple of bar stools where you pick up your order.

2. Service - When I went (Sunday afternoon), there was a longer line to use the restroom than to actually order something. However, even with how empty it was. The register barista was snappy and seemed way too impatient for a lineless Starbucks. Although I'm not usually sensitive about being barked to (c'mon usually these places have way too many customers; cut them some slack), there was NO ONE HERE, so don't yell at me... Perhaps they are usually really busy, so they are in that ""order and go"" sort of mindset."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2014-06-03,3,"I don't know why I'm reviewing a Starbucks but I do feel that even though all drinks are standardly made at each and every SB, the vibe at each one of them is always different. I give this place a 3 stars. I don't like how this Starbucks is laid out. I feel that they could be utilizing their space a lot better but whatev, its Starbucks. You either hate it or love it but It's still going to be there. I do have to say the morning rush does a good job cranking their drinks to customers. There was only one time where I waited 5 minutes for my drink which sucked but other than that I get my CM pretty quickly."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2014-03-21,2,"LOL'ing to the in-depth reviews about the quality of their products when this is simply your run-of-the mill Starbucks in a yuppy neighborhood filled with yoga girls drinking green smoothies and mid-20 year old ""business men"" who take more pride in their looks and how they order their coffee rather than the actual quality of it.

This is your typical Starbucks coupled with rudeness. I find the clientele to be extremely pretentious. Every time I have held open a door for someone I have not gotten a ""thank you."" 2 Stars for the quick service of this sometimes busy location (which I go to because of the lack of quality coffee around the area) which is really great sometimes if you are in a rush, but their commitment to quickness leaves you with a sense of being rushed, having your order taken wrong, rudeness from the employees, and a loss of personalization that is ""supposed"" to come with the Starbucks experience.

Bonus point for the milk/sugar station always being clear because the yuppies already order their sugar-filled upside-down frap mocha caramel machhiato espresso double-flip mocha cherry pies. Minus one for the lack of seating.

Overall, this is just a Starbucks. You are more or less bound to either have a good, bad, or mediocre experience at one of their stores. Quality of coffee remains the same, service and store varies, people are almost always pretentious and over-analytical of their product when it is completely unnecessary since IT IS ALL THE SAME. Just not the most enjoyable experience coming here."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2014-03-11,4,"You know you're impatient but not lazy when you don't want to wait at the Hunter Starbucks and would rather walk 5 blocks to the real Starbucks. 

I like this new Starbucks for my tea and pretzel addiction. The staff has always been friendly and the place is always clean. There isn't much seating though, and you can tell the people who are seated have been there for a loooooooong time drinking up the coffee AND the wifi. They always have the pastries I want (don't judge), and it's nice not having to trek to 3rd Avenue to go to the other (of course) Starbucks."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2014-02-20,5,"Normally, I wouldn't give a review to a chain place like starbucks, BUT try and go to this Starbucks, yes the coffee does taste like the slightly burnt coffee that is served at every starbucks, but the Baristas are wonderful and welcoming! They dont ever seem to be in a rush and if you are unhappy with your drink, they take it back with a smile no questions asked! They are pleasant and wonderful, definitely will be returning"
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2014-02-15,4,"This is my 'go-to' Starbucks before I hop on the F train to head off to Queens to visit friends since the 63rd Street Station (F train) is conveniently located right next to this particular branch. Baristas here are pretty good at what they're doing and not distracted by each other and seem to have their shit together.

 I've yet to see a sign of ghettoness except those awkward times when Chinese ladies peek into the store and try to sell pirated DVDs from China to customers which is pretty embarrassing (must have guts to do that sort of stuff. It's like walking into a Department Store and selling fake Louis Vuitton bags directly across from a Louis Vuitton store lol) But I digress (as usual) yeah. Outlets are available and the overall layout is pretty nice."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2013-12-15,4,"This is a pretty cozy location.  Cushion seating by the large windows, a large coffee bar area by the barista (nice concept), plenty of seating and lots of space overall.  Lighting is not too bright or too dim, it works.

Great place to relax with your drink and get some work done, reading catch up or meet up with friends. 

And the staff won't throw you out."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2013-11-05,4,Long lines in the morning and barely any sitting room just like any Starbucks. The difference here is that they have two cashiers and they keep the lines moving quickly and efficiently. The service is always good and the people have always been friendly. Also conveniently close to the F train.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2013-11-03,4,"This is my most visited Starbucks location. On my commute to work I take the F to Lexington Ave/63rd Street and then go upstairs and walk to transfer to the 4/5/6. But before I do, i usually stop by for a coffee. 

This place almost always has a long line, yet they keep it moving quickly and I before I can think of what I want I'm next on line.  Even waiting for my order isn't too bad. The staff here is so efficient.

The location itself is new, clean, and aesthetically pleasing. I love this Starbucks and will continue to come back.

I'd give it 5 stars, but like others have mentioned there isn't enough seats. However, I'm not too sure how to fix that issue."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2013-10-26,4,"INTEGRAL to my life when I have to switch from the F to the 4/5.  When I think about the awful commute from Central Queens to Wall Street, it really makes me shudder.  By the time I get to the border of Queens, my Dunkin' Donuts coffee is gone.  BUT when I am on the F and have this transfer, I come here!  Oh happy day!

This Starbucks is cleaner than most, and faster than most.  And that counts for a lot in my book.  Also, they usually are NOT out of my favorite breakfast sandwich (the bacon gouda), which earns them a bajillion more points.

Conveniently located on the corner, straight outta the F train.  Gotta love it.  Friendly folks too.

Not the most ideal Starbucks because there is not a lot of seating, but for my purposes, that is not an issue."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2013-10-25,4,"Prettiest Starbucks in the area but very little seating. They have these window seats which are lovely and large but you're not going to cozy up with a stranger even in friendliest of cities and drink coffee on a cushy bench. 

I love it though. I'm glad they opened one I like though I never sit at Starbucks anymore in the city. Now I have WiFi in the apartment plus an iPhone 5. I used to hang out a lot 3 years ago at the 66th and 3rd, which has a lot of seating and chatty regulars. 

Still it's nice to have one within a block of Burger Heaven which serves bilge water passing for coffee. I only go to Burger Heaven at all for breakfast because I love the people who work there and the view is so nice. 

The Artisan sandwich is a nice cheap breakfast option now that Wrap 'n Run has closed for good. The fire/flood a few trips ago was so sad for the owner who still owns one up town in the high 70s. I miss my Caribbean smoothie and I don't think Starbucks smoothies are anything to write home about.

Last week, I ordered a tall coffee (that's all I ever order at Starbucks other than the sandwiches) and there had to have been two tablespoons of coffee grounds at the bottom. I meant to keep the cup but threw it out and they replaced it without proof of purchase. I thought that was very nice. 

I might sit here with my laptop if there were anywhere to sit but the communal table is always jammed. This is like a commuter Starbucks but nicer inside."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2013-10-21,4,Im not a overall fan of Starbucks but this spot is convenient. The staff is friendly. Theres always a long line but it seems to move quickly.  Only downfall is that there is not enough seating.  They could get smaller tables and add more chairs. A counter with bar stool seating on the side would be helpful too. Sometimes you just want to slow down and catch up with the news and your paperwork. I always liked starbucks for their intellectual crowd. As for the coffee. I usually pass on it and get the iced green tea instead.
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2013-08-01,3,"Quick service and simple queue, but somehow they gave me the wrong tea type the first time when I asked for a green iced tea (they gave me black)."
93,starbucks-new-york-268,2013-05-31,4,Standard Starbucks offerings. (I'm actually a fan of Peet's which apparently only we on the West Coast are fortunate enough to enjoy). This review is for the interior design - the textures and colors...not to mention detailed ceiling tiles....LOVE the thought  that was put into turning this space into a place.
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2020-02-04,5,"I have been avoiding certain Pret A Manager locations because of horrible customer service. This one I've generally had good luck. This morning I came in for a sandwich to put with the rest of my lunch, and it took a bit longer than expected to be toasted. Staff was great and offered me an espresso on the house for my troubles, so I accepted it since it saved me from stopping off at Blue Bottle to wait 20 minutes for my usual cortado. Great customer service. Hopefully it continues..."
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2020-01-06,3,"Average brunch  / lunch atmosphere.  They have a ton of space if you need to WORK ON THE LAPTOP COMPUTER.
        Not many plugs...,but there's a few place's you can plug-in the wall. 

          I ordered the: 
       Chipotle Chicken Avocado Wrap with red pepper, guacamole pepper-jack cheese = 7.5
        It's really small for $8.00us...,however it is Manhattan. 

Ambiance = 4.5
Customer Service = 8.0 

     I would come back."
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2019-04-12,1,The majority of the employees here aren't exactly very welcoming. (Seems to be an overall theme at most Pret's). I do enjoy they're selection but sometimes it's a complete miss with their warm food choices. My burrito/wrap was super crispy and attached to the packaging.
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2018-07-19,1,"So I gave one star or I could even give 5 stars for the food or coffee in this place. It is a nice place for fresh food and drinks. me and my boyfriend we go there once in a while cuz customer service sucks big time. I mean we try and go to different Locations Pret a manger, we have one on Lexington Avenue between 44th&43rd street which is a block away from where we live. Now the first time we went there the worst night mare ever. I asked for an ice coffee and they gave me a lukewarm coffee in a plastic ice coffee cup without ice and I started asking myself ""hey is this some new kind of ice coffee??"" Cuz it was quite hot to be ice coffee without the ice again. So I asked my boyfriend to hold it and he gave me the look with WTH!! So we told the gentleman at the cashier and he asked a lady who didn't give a damn about it !! Just forget the apology cuz she didn't even care but she went on talking to the guy and kept me waiting almost 5-7mins and in that I asked them if it was coming today?!! 
A street cart guy can give better customer service than these people. 
Now I went ahead and spend time and effort to put this review because we went to another Pret A Manger on Lexington Avenue but this time around some 50street which is close to my work. I got the same experience. Ordered coffee and went to fill milk and there were no milk so I went and asked the gentleman at the cashier and again he asked a lady working there and instead to grabbing milk she grab a broom and started sweeping in the counter and she say she was getting it or hold on for a minute nothing.. so we waited and she went on sweeping so I looked over to see what was so important than customers that she had to sweep for almost 10mins,, no!!no glasses or barely any dirt. I mean she was staring at us and sweeping as if like she was saying"" manage it without the milk!!"""
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2018-04-23,3,"The past few weeks I feel like the quality has gone down in food.  Every single morning I get two hard boiled eggs and a banana.  Lately, the eggs have tasted very strange (like a vinegar or fish smell), I've thrown the last three orders away.  Secondly, this location seems to be against having ripe bananas. Literally baskets full of bananas that aren't ready to eat for roughly two or three days.  The eggs though have been very unpleasant.  I will try the one on 3rd Ave to see if they have different tasting eggs and ripe bananas."

I was on my way home and stop by 52nd Lexington at 8:30pm to get a coffee cause I was getting cold.the cashier took my order without any Hi or any thanks at the end... when I finish paying she was looking at me like a stranger for a few second and I asked her ""where is my coffee ?"" And she was like "" right there  in your back! Whith a disrespectful attitude"". I said Ok and I went to make the coffee there was No cups available for Small size (she was so busy on the phone instead of putting more cups) so I went back to her and I said "" can you please get a cop for me cause there is none"".she said "" you don't see the cup ? What is that ? And I'm like there is no small cup and she said : you paid for medium size! and when I look for medium cups line, it was nothing... and I told her is nothing here and with attitude she scream on me saying look look the third line they also medium cups and I said relax please and she walk away from me with attitude... it was too much very bad customer service and my coffee wasn't even hot.When I was leaving the store I asked  her if I can talk to the manager and with a scared face she said he's not here and I ask her who is in charge right now and she show me her coworker telling me that's her and I explain everything to her...I'll never go back there"

A week ago as I was on my way to work I wanted coffee. I usually go to Starbucks but I was running a little late and the lines are normally long. As I was walking down Lexington Ave and 52nd st ( I believe it's 52nd) I ran in. No lines I grabbed a few other stuff. I got my coffee and I picked up a banana and a cup of grapes and ran off to work. Fast forward 3 hrs later about 2 grapes in I noticed there was something funny on my grape. It was MOLD!!!! The most disgusting thing I have ever seeennn! I threw them out I was so upset because it was almost 5$ I paid just for it to go to waste. When I got home my mom said I should have took them back but it didn't even cross my mind how grossed out I was. I will never ever walk into another PRET! Ever in my lifeeee! I am not terrified to eat from there, I started thinking if the coffee is even fresh. Yuck!"
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2017-11-08,4,"Convenient ly located, fully stocked of varied healthy delicious pastries and beyond, great spacious seating, fast friendly staff, and inexpensive.

Did I mention they have the best butter crossoints? They are fresh, perfectly moist and crisp, not too big -- no fuss and delicious. Probably shouldn't have too many of these! :P"
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2017-09-21,5,Great spot for breakfast. The pumpkin yogurt was out of this world. The chocolate croissant a must try and all their juices are delicious.
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2017-09-18,4,Nice Pret! Much bigger than others. I like how there's plenty of seating and the food is always well stocked. The staff is also nice and friendly. I like this location a lot.
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2017-09-11,4,"What's to say?!  Great fresh sandwiches and salads, reasonable prices, quick and easy. I love the baguette sandwiches,  especially the Caprese one. Pleasant seating at this location."
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2017-08-03,3,"I'll tell you one thing, they sure are consistent about always running out of chocolate chip cookies."
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2016-12-13,2,Great selection of food! Would you please train your employee's to provide a better service.
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2016-10-11,2,"I just had their Chicken and Bacon pre-made sandwich and was disappointed with the portions. The sandwich is deceptively packaged to give the customer the impression that it has a uniform layer of chicken and bacon. When I disassembled the sandwich to take a quick peak, I noticed that both the chicken (4 tiny pieces) and the one solitary strip of bacon had been sneakily placed very close to the cut edge, giving the visual impression that the sandwich has a generous portion of both. The outer cardboard packaging cleverly hides the rest of the sandwich so that we are unable to see the rest of the sandwich from other sides. As a result, when you bite into the sandwich, you get one or two mouthfuls of chicken and bacon, but the rest of it disappoints because it only has a thin layer of tomatoes and mixed greens on more than half of the available area.

It's too bad that Pret has to resort to this type of dishonest trickery to make a living. They don't realize the cumulative damage they are doing to themselves and their brand in the long run. As a customer, my poor experience will stay with me, and I will mention it to others, whenever the topic comes up. Now imagine what 5000 people like me could be saying about them?

Pret - I strongly recommend that you consider making an honest sandwich and charging an honest price. Your dishonesty is a real shame. Stop playing games and earn an honest living!"
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2016-09-05,5,"Close to the hotel I was staying at and serves lunch options during ""breakfast"" hours. Great location, clean, lots of space, and the cashiers were great!"
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2016-08-17,4,"By far the best layout of any Pret I've ever been in (and we're talking a lot of Pret's)!  Clean, open, tons of seating, well-stocked even during morning rush hour, adequate staff, and a better-or-equal variety of options than area competitors.  I'm a fan!"
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2016-08-15,4,"I've never actually been in one of these places: I figured anything I saw multiple times in multiple cities isn't worth stopping into in any of them if there was an alternative. Last Thursday, there was no alternative, because I had six minutes and I was really hungry.

Next to ready-made sandwiches, they had row upon row of ready-made miniature salads, with which you could mix and match salad dressings. For less than $3, and 60 seconds after I'd walked in, I had a 1-cup salad with spinach, quinoa, sliced egg, cherry tomato, and avocado, topped with ""chimichurri vinaigrette."" Can't beat that. The bathrooms were also clean.

Was it the freshest salad I'd ever had? No. Would I go back and do it again? Definitely."
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2016-06-29,5,"First of all, I appreciate this company for selling organic coffee at an affordable price. Thank you very much. This location, compared to the one on 51st & Park and the one on 54th & 3rd, has the nicest, friendliest staff. Keep up the great work, it is truly appreciated."
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2016-05-19,4,"Delicious sammiches, surprisingly good mac and cheese, friendly service. This place is great if you need something to ""grab and go"" for lunch. They also have seating but I've never been able to stick around long enough to take advantage of that. They constantly restock items, especially during the lunch rush. I find their prices are better than similar places in the area by a good $2-$5. I also love how many credit card machines they have so there's never a line to pay."
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2015-11-19,5,"So this time I have tried their hot wrap and soup for lunch, despite the fact that I have checked out their coffee many more times. 

Chose the turkey wrap and chicken noodle soup, both were kept at a good temperature. Except the crust was a bit dry for the wrap, I liked their cranberry sauce filling a lot - for a ready-to-go type of wrap, what more can you ask?"
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2015-10-29,5,"We were looking for another coffee shop we found in Yelp, but the directions were off so we stopped here instead!  By far the friendliest staff we've experienced while in NYC.  I had a pumpkin spice latte and my husband had a caramel latte, they were both perfect temperature and super tasty! We split a chocolate croissant, which was so delicious.  He went back and got a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and they gave us a cookie on the house!  We will be back before we leave town for sure!  
 
The store is very clean and everyone is super nice.  A refreshing expletive!"
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2015-03-22,4,Great simple breakfast. Best yogurt and good lattes. Could use a bit more breakfast selection but what they offer is very good.
94,pret-a-manger-new-york-67,2015-03-11,4,"This is your usual Pret A Manger - but if you haven't been here, the place sells tasty pre-made hot/cold sandwiches, salads, wraps, and soups.  They also have a number of pastries at the counter, coffee, drinks, sandwich sides, and their own brand of chips/popcorn.  They have both your standard sandwiches (like ham and cheese, egg salad, etc) as well as some more interesting flavors (like Posh Cheddar & Chutney, Hoisin Duck Wrap, etc.).  The selection of food changes frequently, so you can expect to see new options on a monthly basis.  I highly recommend going for their new seasonal creations, usually found in the first refrigerated case as you enter on the right (at this time they have a Louisiana Crawfish Flatbread - which will soon change).  For a quick grab and go place, it is very delicious.

This intersection has multiple grab and go choices, with Au Bon Pain across the street, Fika next door, and Paris Baguette catty-corner.  If you want something fast and/or the best quality sandwich, then go here.  The other options are better for baked goods and coffee.

The service is always friendly and fast.  The counters are normally clean and sandwiches being stocked when I go, though that is normally later on during the lunch rush.  If they are out of anything, just flag down a service person and ask for the product - they likely have more in the back.

The place has comfortable seating, and they've done a good job separating the section that you enter from, pick your food from, and purchase at, from the seating area.  In that way you're not being bother by people as you're eating.  The place has a lot of lighting, as well as lots of windows so it's bright."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2019-10-07,5,"I have been to this place many times and in different locations. I have to say this location makes the best avocado toast. I enjoyed the mixed greens and carrots on top. I added some pepper and it tasted so good. My friend food the frittata, which she enjoyed as well. 

The place has nice relaxed seating. Staff is super nice. The location is great for a lunch/brunch in midtown. If you're taking the metro from grand central, this would be a good place for you to take a break at outside of Grand Central madness. 3 mins walk!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2019-10-07,1,"I found a black hair ( not mine) in my tea. When I brought it up, they barely apologized. Overall, the LPQs I've been to in the city seem pretty dirty with slow and unfriendly staff."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2019-09-10,4,Our brunch was delicious! Only a few steps away from Grand central station. My avocado toast with Salomon was perfect! Only 4 stars because they don't sell soda. I know it's more of a healthy restaurant but I wanted a sprite not oj or water.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2019-07-16,5,I had great experience and good service. Sarah extremely helpful and a very nice. She is super friendly and polite. Thank you
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2019-06-08,3,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon to catch up with a friend - no wait for a table upstairs and relatively quick service, too.

I got a breakfast sandwich without bacon - it was decent, although perhaps a bit oily. It came with a generous helping of avocado, however! I also got an iced green tea, which was refreshing with some fruity notes. But then again I'm not too picky when it comes to green tea!

Solid spot for coffee/tea or a quick bite, but nothing super special. Interior decor is cute and seating is aplenty, though!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2019-05-24,4,"Yes I know it's a chain and yes I know it can be hit or miss, but yes... I'm giving Le Pain Quotidien 4 stars for the following:  Vegan options on the menu gave us choices.  A variety of salads, entrees and sides were not over the top delicious, but our party thought they were pretty solid and no complaints. This LPQ location was comfortable and the service by Timothy was very good.  Last but not least, as tourists, a clean bathroom in midtown is always a welcome thing too!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2019-05-12,4,"We came for dinner on a weekday evening before the theater. It wasn't too crowded and we were seated immediately.

I had previously been in for coffee and avocado toast to go but this was my first dinner experience.

I loved the chili sin carne and the fresh mint infusion. Fresh mint infusion is so simple but so delightful. It felt like drinking actual tea, but simple and healthy. The mint lemonade was just alright. I probably wouldn't get that again.

When I paid, I forgot to scan my app for credit for the meal and the receipt did not have a barcode for me to scan after the fact (usually there's a barcode). I ended up writing to the contact on the website and everything was fine."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2019-05-11,1,"Stopped for a bite to eat.   Three waiters.    Slow day.

Zero service.   After five minutes I got a menu.    At the 15 minute mark (times it) - no service, no water - gave up and just ordered from the to go.

Would not return"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2019-04-10,4,"Local chain in NYC- lots of these are floating around Manhattan. In this location I tried their almond milk latte, which was delicious. Friendly staff and quick service. Lots of places to sit as well, so this would be a great place to have a meeting if you're visiting NYC for work!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2019-02-01,5,"It's not often that I give a full five star review to a franchise restaurant/chain, but this Le Pain Quotidien (say that fast three times) is absolutely amazing!  The service is incredible, nice, and patient, the interior is nicely put-together and clean, and the coffee/tea selection and taste is superb."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2019-01-05,4,"We discovered this breakfast restaurant after looking for a place far away from the ever present Starbucks and Co. We were so tired of all the trash (plastic, cups) we had to leave behind at these places on our NY trip. Thanks for having real cups, Le Pain Quotidien!! It would be even better, if the milk wasn't brought in small single-use cups. The avocado toast is super nice, the Baker Breakfast left me a little hungry, though. We had breakfast at the place twice while staying in NY."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-12-24,3,"Came here after visiting the public library. The place is nice, the food is okay, a bit pricy for coffee compare to other places nearby."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-12-03,5,Great food and service! Elizabeth was FANTASTIC!!! The coffee is to die for! I bought 3 bags to take home! Avocado toast was awesome! Oatmeal with berries and maple syrup!
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-11-15,1,"I am upset with my experience. I went in for a plain breakfast sandwich of egg and cheese. They do not have a breakfast menu posted behind the cashier so I was unaware of sandwich items. I asked the barista and was told Le Quotidien has a sandwich with egg, cheese, avocado, Chipotle aoli, and bacon. I asked again, if they sold just egg and cheese sandwiches, which is all I wanted. I felt the barista ended up over charging me for a sandwich with amenities I did not want. I paid the full price even though I only wanted egg and cheese. In addition, my sandwich was just sitting on the food counter for 8 minutes or so by the time a server cared to give it to me. The sandwich was cold. I'm upset that I was over charged and that the breakfast sandwich add-ons were not explained to me that they come with the sandwich."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-11-11,1,"This was absolutely the worst service ever. A group of 10 of us came as a gathering on a Sunday afternoon around 2:30 after lunch. We were totally ignored for 45 minutes. On several occasions, I tried getting one of the 3 or 4 waitpersons attention. If they responded at all, it would be 'we're working on it' or something ridiculous like that. To ignore s table of 10, when 3 -4 wait people were working was ludicrous. It was more than rude. It was insulting and humiliating. There actually was nowhere else to go. I have never seen such terrible service. This place is run extremely poorly. It should be closed down.Avoid at all costs."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-11-05,1,"Agree with reviewer on 9/23. In fact many reviewers say this --extremely slow service as understaffed if you sit down!!  Here twice over the past year and same problem. I found food quality also has gone down and now find better value and food quality for breakfast at the Westin Grand Central where i was staying. Party of five received two egg dishes underwhelming and served in small aluminum bowls.  Think two eggs put in pan , then an oven , with a few chives and bacon bits and a piece of bread. Great dish if I was teaching a child to cook! $11.99 avocado on dry toast. Coffee served in paper cups--really. No reason to return, especially after long history of poor service and no response by management. I thought prices were high besides!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-10-11,5,Had a wonderful working lunch and coffee yesterday with colleagues. Service was amazingly attentive and friendly. Food was very delicious and healthy. Really enjoyed my visit.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-09-23,1,Service sucks absolutely the worst! They are so short on staff it's unreal. I go on a lunch break and wait forever! I do not recommend this place to anyone!
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-09-05,4,"I came here for a networking event hosted by Her Corner. In case you're interested, they are upstairs once a month, and mainly attended by women. They provide free coffee - I got an almond milk latte - they're the biggest lattes in the history of lattes! So worth the price. They are also delicious, smooth, not too bitter, and presented really nicely. Kamal, the server, was very helpful and friendly - smiles all around! 

I also love Le Pain's atmosphere. It's more high-end and classier than Starbucks, so it's excellent for small business meetings, which you'll see here all around. There's a bathroom, along with a ton of seating and tables. WiFi works well, and the music is low enough so that you can concentrate. 

The one thing that was off-putting was that I asked another server before Kamal for a latte, and just as I said, ""excuse me,"" he brushed me off and walked away, even though he'd clearly heard. That was pretty rude; may have been on break, but that's no way to talk to anyone, period. 

Anyway, I love Le Pain, and this convenient location, for a clean-cut, fancy-shmancy cafe rendezvous."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-09-05,3,"Nice menu
Good space and location

It would be nice to turn the ac on in the summer I don't need to feel like I'm in France with no ac.

What up"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-06-27,4,"Avocado toast was very good, and filling enough. Great presentation as well. Knocking off 1 star solely due to Price..the toast was $11.99 I believe."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-06-01,3,"Got the warm grain bowl. Pretty good,but  definitely is not a meal. A bit pricy at 14.99. I left still hungry. The waitress was quick to take my order but never came back to see if I wanted anything else. I also never got water or bread until I was finished eating."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-05-13,5,Cute and artsy spot. Food was quite delicious! Had the breakfast sandwhich on brioche and some chamomile tea.  Staff was very nice and professional.  Price was appropriate!
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-04-26,5,"I have come here a few times over the last few months and each time the food and service have been superb. The smoked salmon and avocado tartine is amazing and you must try the cheesecake. Although I wish the service was a little faster at times, the servers I've come across especially one of the spanish girls who I think might be a manager, have been pleasant and very attentive."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-03-10,4,"The food was amazing!! Loved the flavor - easy to pick vegan choices, and a quick walk from Grand Central Station."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2018-02-10,5,"This (Le Pain Quotidien - 16 East 44th St) is one of my favorite restaurant in New York. The food is very delicious and it's extremely healthy. What makes this place so good are the waitresses especially one name Sarah (the Asian lady). Everyone I came with all agreed. She always has a smiling face and handle our orders superior well. Always ask if we need anything else. We felt very warm and seems like we were home in our castles when she served us. She is the main reason we keep on coming back over and over again. Thank you Sarah for being the best waitress in NYC. Because of you, this place deserved a 5 Stars!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-12-02,1,"Today was the last straw for me. I stopped by quickly to purchase a few items. The Hispanic lady behind the register who may be a manager is rude, condescending and racist. She has a little habit of calling herself mocking me and she continued with her bullsh*t today. When I entered, there were no customers at the counter. She was counting money, and despite seeing me there, she completely ignored me and continued with what she was doing. No I'll be with you shortly or anything. Eventually when she felt she was ready to deal with me, she looks up with absolutely no greeting whatsoever and blurted out ""double espresso?"" 

She's even had the audacity to call me when I've made lunch purchases online for pickup and lie about items not being in stock, and then when I inquire, she proceeds to mock me and ask if I ordered a double espresso. This is her little ""joke"" every time I come in that she thinks she's being cute with. Until she is gone and a few others are fired here, I will not be patronizing this Le Pain Quotidien. Other customers should do the same. When these @ssholes don't have a job, we'll see how cute they think that is.

Most of the workers here simply have no manners whatsoever, so I refuse to spend my money in a place that treats customers in such a disgusting manner."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-10-14,1,"Great coffee, lovely bread but disappointing skillet eggs - first one arrived fried to death, almost rubbery. The second one came back clearly undercooked with a clear coating around the yolk. 
No time to send it back so ate some of the avocado with bread 
Disappointing."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-09-23,1,Never thought I'd dislike a LPQ. Have loved them in California and London and I'm sure there are some good ones in the rest of NYC but this one is a nightmare. Eggs in the skillet were stuck to the surface and the meager smoked salmon was a rip off. Even the coffee tasted weird. Waitress forgot to bring butter. She was so overworked I decided not to flag her down. Unfair to withhold tip. Should withhold the entire check.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-09-19,2,"Come here often but this visit sucked. Terrible service and not that busy today...3:00 so way after lunch rush. Desired oatmeal w/berries. Came cold as did my wife's quiche. Told server who NEVER SMILED ONCE it was cold. She must have popped it into the microwave and yes it was hot. So were my ""fresh berries"".  So sad to see server so miserable. Not one crack of a smile the entire time."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-08-10,1,I've been a regular every Tuesday for 3 years but the quality and atmosphere has declined. Portion size on the smoked salmon salad are much smaller and for the price definitely a rip off. The noise and crowd at lunchtime is uncomfortable and the wait staff slow and disinterested. Will not be coming back.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-07-21,1,Ordered 2 drinks and two breakfast items. None of them were good. A complete waste of my money.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-05-20,1,"The service was horrible. It took them an hour to bring out half of our order and the manager just said they were understaffed. He tried to make it better, but his immediate response was not one a customer wants to hear. 
We love this franchise, but this was awful service."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-05-19,1,"Awful experience worst of this chain
Careless lazy waitress
Left our oatmeal on counter until it got cold
had the busboy bring it as waitress was
Nowhere in sight Had to ask for milk 1oz busboy looked surprised and acted like it
was a big favor for us
My one soft boiled egg came to table 25 min after ordering and when  asked  what took so long she said the egg poacher was broken
It came hard boiled, the shell came off in tiny pieces
Stay away from this place even if starving"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-04-30,5,First time I've ever been here and I loved the almond milk latte! So many yummy breakfast choices that aren't super heavy! Avocado toast was great and the baked eggs! The only complaint I had was that they were out of oatmeal when we were there and it was only 9:00. But overall I enjoyed my first experience and will definitely be back!
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-03-25,4,"I like AVOCADO TOAST. The avocado tastes so fresh and healthy. The daily blends ""super green"" tastes very fresh and healthy with tastes of celery and cucumber. The ""almond butter berry"" is good with heavier texture and rich almond taste. In general, I think the food here is very healthy."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-02-28,5,"The crew here are great. I have been to so many other locations so I knew what to expect. Or so I thought. First off if you are not a New Yorker, then you will see differences as far as the atmosphere and people,but its not a bad thing at all. But the two waiters I had, gold! No issues they were on it and the new associate I met and spoke to for about an hour both agreed that this is a great location.Unlike me they are a daily regular there.I would too if I lived close . I have been to other locations here in the district ( F street,) and they were far from nice( except the union station one) , and the establishment was bigger and less congested.

 I ordered my soup, coffee and toast, ordered some stuff to go and had a great conversation. They did not rush me they just kept making sure that I was fine. Its a great place for coffee and yummy avocado toast! I cant wait to go back when I visit home. I always stop in when I am coming from the Japanese Book store( I made an updated review on) I am thankful for the atmosphere, and the chargers at the middle of the tables when come in and make a left. They were life saver considering both phones died! I have no idea why they say the service is slow , they had everything out to me so quick and boxed the stuff I didnt eat. Like I said before, its my go to place when I am in the area. Great quick coffee date, business meet or hangout spot."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-01-12,3,"My family and I have been to le pain quotidian in various locations. While all other locations we've been have great and friendly staffs, this location has the worst counter staff! This lady we encountered yesterday afternoon was very unwelcoming and boarder line rude. 

We will be patronize a similar establishment on the same block from now on."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2017-01-07,4,Amazing organic coffee.  Food has that farm to table freshness.  Had the butternut squash and goat cheese frittata.  Delicious.  Very relaxed atmosphere with music that matches the ambience.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-12-15,5,"Been here several times in the past few months. Great coffee, food, and service. 

9 days ago I left my polarized Ray Bans there after a business meeting. I went back in today and the manager had them waiting for me on his desk. A+ customer service that I so appreciate. I'll be back anytime I'm in the area."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-12-10,2,"Service was poor but polite. Fetched my own menus after the wait, no spoon, order was placed wrong, tea was cold, etc. etc. but when it came and we one-by-one requested all the missing bits, it was pretty good. Still wait for the butter..."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-12-03,3,"I don't know why people say the service is slow and waiters inattentive. I went around 5pm and got great service. It's the perfect place to read or review any documents. The ""Lemon Tart"" I ordered was on point and the ""Rasberry Lemonade"" was just right. I see a lot of interesting items on their menu that I do want to try. I can't wait to come back here for breakfast one day."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-12-02,1,I don't know why I keep repeating the mistake of coming here.  Maybe because it is centrally located and never really crowded. The service here is really really SLOW and inattentive.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-11-05,4,"A reliable place near my work for me to meet people for business. It's never too crowded or noisy, whether it's 9am or 3pm on a weekday.

I always order a hot green tea and love that LPQ has a sizeable, handle-less bowl to drink it from, along with the teapot. 

It really is an easy spot to sit down for 30 minutes to have a business-related conversation, because it's situated centrally in midtown. 

But LPQ is a pretty quick, low-key chain, so don't expect outstanding service. You go in there for the no-frill experience."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-08-05,5,"This place is my favorite place to come for lunch especially when I need to sit and review a document.

The staff is great, especially Sarah and Mary Jo. They always check in on me and keep my water glass filled.

My favorite thing on the menu currently is the avocado toast. I also love the Melon Berry Basil Cooler.

The mini chocolate brownie is a great way to round off any meal.

Thank you!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-07-22,5,"Had a private lunch on the second floor for 23 people and Mykel and his entire staff was amazing. This is the very first time I've planned an event where it went flawlessly. I only had to send one email for the initial set up describing what I wanted and then showed up at the time of the event and everything was set up and perfect. More importantly, everyone there was so nice - it was a pleasure to have the event there. Thank you!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-06-02,5,"Mmmm tuna tartine with a Watermelon Cooler. Followed by an iced cappuccino for the road  
Thanks for a great meal, Mary-Jo and Roxana!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-05-23,1,"Surprisingly, I have no complaints about the quality of the food. But if you're dining in, beware! I'm guessing no one wants to read the details of my lunchtime dining saga so in short, it was terrible, almost laughable except for the fact that I was very hungry, bordering on hangry. Even if not particularly crowded, do not expect to have a cup of coffee in your hands in under 60 minutes! I actually tried to order a cup on the take-away side and some bread for the table while we waited to be acknowledged but was rudely told that if I ordered from the counter I was not permitted to sit with my family!  Had I not been there with two toddlers and 7 other adults who were much more patient than me, I would have left immediately. Order to-go or choose another location!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-05-19,2,"The avocado toast saves this location with 2 stars.  This particular LPQ does not live up to the experience had at others.   The staff is militant about tables and frown on those who oder at the counter and look for a seat (there are two crowded high top tables they'll point you to).   The upstairs is spacious but off limits.  Everything else appears to be up to the LPQ standard but I suggest passing this location by if your interested in a nice, uneventful drop in for a coffee and a chat.

Come on LPQ team, get with it.  A simple attitude upgrade and your location could rock!!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-05-08,2,2 stars because the food looked amazing. Sat for 15 minutes with the menu in front of me. The waitress and several bus people walked by many times and never even offered me water. Had to leave
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-04-26,2,"Nice environment and pea soup was good, however:

- I ordered the special salad of the day, a chicken salad on mixed greens.  Dressing had no flavor and there was barely any of it.  But the reason for the two-star rating was there was a substantial amount of dirt and grit in the lettuce, like having a spoonful of sand thrown in.  I left half of the $14.50 salad uneaten.  Unfortunately the lettuce was on the bottom and I did not discover it until I had already eaten half the salad or else I would have sent it back.  No excuse for a fast casual chain trying to be a step above to have unwashed lettuce

- Waiter did not speak any English.  I could not explain that I wanted a different salad dressing"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-04-11,2,"The Belgian Hot Chocolate tastes diluted, although I like that it's not overpowering sweet. The service is not friendly. The counter girl grabbed Belgian Chocolate brownies when I asked for Hot Chocolate and made me feel that it was my fault. No smile at all. Once I had to move my chair because they tried to pull the trash can through the main dining area. There are trash on the floor as well. 

This place can do better."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-03-24,4,"Clean, good service.  Great Belgian hot chocolate and the Smoked Salmon Breakfast was very good.  If you want simply prepared food at a decent price and a comfortable place to sit in between appointments or at lunch hour, you can't go wrong. The chia pudding is probably my favorite!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-03-22,5,"Loved it, lots of vegan options and tons of room. Plenty of seating upstairs at noon on a weekday."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-02-24,2,2 stars only because the menu was pretty basic for me and there wasn't much to choose from. I've seen pictures from people who go to the Stamford location and i'm not sure if it's a different menu or what but their plates look fuller. It was just plain and straight forward with not much to look forward to. I'll try this again another time to see if i change my mind.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-02-14,4,This place is nice for pasties and coffee. It's not the place for breakfast if your looking for bacon and eggs. I had the soft boiled egg with an assortment of organic breads and jams for only $5. It was the perfect light breakfast I was looking for.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-01-15,2,"Despite Le Pain Quotidien having locations EVERYWHERE I've only been the one time. I'd read the menu beforehand and while their options aren't incredibly inspired, they did have many. Including healthy breakfast standards that I've come to love (like avocado toast and chia pudding). I'd been planning on going by myself, but since my boyfriend and I were shopping nearby we went together. Since we went around 5 PM they didn't have the breakfast options I'd been looking forward to, so we just went for drinks and a dessert. We got a hot chocolate, the seasonal cinnamon latte, and the (also seasonal) speculoos tiramisu. 

I'm not sure if all the stores are designed the same, but I did enjoy the location. Lots of space, and a spot I'd recommend if you want to read a book and munch alone. The service was a little off, with our drinks and food taking around 20 minutes to arrive despite us being the only ones there. Both of our drinks were pretty off. My latte barely tasted of cinnamon, and was pretty flavorless all-around. My boyfriend's hot chocolate was a complete waste. It arrived as a cup of warm (no, not hot) milk with a small cup of melted chocolate. After a bit of difficulty getting the chocolate into the milk (the spoon they'd supplied was too large to scoop out the mixture, and the chocolate was too thick to pour easily) we were disappointed by how flavorless it was, just brown milk. The only good thing we'd had was the speculoos tiramisu. While it was mostly cream, it was still tasty. I really enjoyed the speculoos, gave it a nice sweetness. I just wish it'd 1) been larger 2) was more reminiscent of an actual tiramisu (in other words, lady fingers???!)

I'd potentially go back to a different Le Pain Quotidien for their breakfast options, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do it. The items were unbelievably overpriced for tiny and disappointing portions."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-01-03,4,"It's always packed. Obsessed with their gluten-free bread, it's better than normal bread."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2016-01-02,2,"I'm a big fan of the chain, but this location was severely lacking in more than one area.

I don't mind seating myself. However, having someone bluntly ask ""How many?"" And then toss a menu on the table is not a good way to start a meal. I ordered a glass of Grenache with my chicken curry tartine. It came quickly, but was ICE cold. Who serves red wine at fridge temp? Not cool.  The food came in a reasonable time and was perfectly fine, but I had to flag down my server to get the bill. While, waiting for her, I noticed how terribly dirty the light fixtures are about the communal table. 

Overall, not thrilled about spending $25 on lunch for this kind of an experience."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-12-29,1,"This is the worst Le Pain Quotidien I've been to. We came at 5:35 and waitress warned us that they are closing soon (7pm?).
They served only one type of beer (Stella) and only one type of red wine that was super chilled. Manager explained that ""we keep everything in the fridge because of health department"". Wow!
My wife wanted soup, and waitress said they have only one soup - carrot (because they closing soon!?). Later to the couple sitting next to us she said they have only butternut squash soup. What?
Both tartines came with standard presentation but tasted bland.
Probably for the first time I left without coffee and dessert from Le Pain Q."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-12-27,2,"The fish sandwich while tasty was really difficult to eat as a sandwich due to presentation being very unwieldy 

Probably better choices nearby"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-10-26,2,"food is consistently good but service is slow, getting take out either by ordering on phone or in person is terrible took 20 minutes to get soup or on hold for 10 minutes. I have complained several times to the manager and he is unaplogetic and doesnt care"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-10-12,2,"The quiche was amazing, and so is the coffee, but unfortunately this place gets two stars. Long wait and non-existing service (our waiter took forever and we got our coffee and quiche 17 minutes after we sat down)."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-09-10,1,"Went there for the 1st time just now, and will NOT go back again. Do NOT waste your time please if you work in the offices around this area since the service was up to a standard. I am from a corporate office and I expect more. 

Decided to get something sweet after lunch. Was there about 2:15 pm. The store décor is lovely but the service is terrible. Couple customers in the store getting lunch/coffee...bunch of staffs also hanging around chatting. Seems not too busy but have 2 customers in the line waiting, including me. The cashier is preparing food for the customer before me, and I thought I would be the next one. Since she's the only cashier standing there working so I present myself in the middle of the waiting area, in front of her. I am holding on my parfait for like 8 mins. I am just in front of her and there's no way she would miss me for any reason. The cashier seems very happy and chatting smiling with another 2-3 staffs standing not too far from her. They are not helping her, but delaying her service. In addition, she doesn't have a mask on her so her saliva went down onto the bread that she's preparing. I don't think she wears gloves too, I remembered she used a bare hand to give my change back...I wait wait and wait, until she finished the last customer then she moved to the side. So I followed her to the side thinking that might be her station. Do you know what she did? This dark skin lady totally ignored me and took a walk-in customer instead. As I explained to the cashier that me and the other customer are waiting for her over there, she goes so calm and didn't even apologize that ""this is the line"". I was like, ""well, there's no sign that you are here"" because she was in the middle a while ago. 

You need them to recognize you as a customer to appreciate your service. If not , bottom line, please wear a mask & gloves!!!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-09-07,5,"Can't go wrong with this chain. My favorite, this location right next to the station, and has plenty of seating."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-08-28,5,"Love this location, spacious, bright, and they don't kick you out if you want to hang.  I had the usual, great hot chocolate and a muffin, delicious.  I always ask for extra jelly and they're happy to accommodate.  Our waitress Mary Jo was fabulous, took our order, came back a few times to make sure we were fine.  She filled my glass with water a few times, great service.  I highly recommend this spot to anyone in Midtown East."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-08-23,1,"Disgusting!!! There were flies roaming all over the baked goods. We told the woman at the register about it. She came, she saw, she shrugged her shoulder and did absolutely nothing about the fly situation and walked back to where she was previously standing at the counter. Well that was reason enough for us to not only not buy anything from this trash bin but also never go back here ever again."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-08-16,5,"I'm a huge fan of this chain. I can get incredibly yummy vegan food here - namely the avocado toast. My friends and I make these restaurants a regular eating place for us. We even took a road trip and only ate when we found one. 

We stumbled into this particular location after another one informed us they were out of the avo toast. The waiter was so fantastic he made us forget we had walked an extra 7 blocks to get there. 

I highly recommend eating here if you are in the area. It has yet to disappoint."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-07-24,5,"I just recently came back from a trip to Paris, France and found this little gem walking around Grand Central. Wow, I was amazed by the authenticity of the food and pastries, very representative of traditional French cuisine Great variation of appetizers and entrees, nice wine list and the desserts and coffee were outstanding. Above all, the service was amazing! Everyone was very friendly, the atmosphere was nice and serene. All areas were clean and neatly presented. I sat on the second  floor which is very spacious and quiet. They also have wine tastings on certain days which is very neat for all the wine lovers like myself. Overall, I was very satisfied with the food and service and will be coming back whenever I'm in the area. I highly recommend this location, hope you enjoy the experience as I did. Aurevoir!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-07-02,1,Just on pure principal that no one checked Their inventory (like a manger) then when I asked why they were recently skipping on everything and the personnel just shrugged their shoulders and didn't know why or how to answer... I'm an idiot for purchasing but I just woke up with the craving that it was going to be my breakfast and no other le pain was around so I settled - but WOW do I feel robbed!
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-06-18,3,"Good, solid higher-end bakery/cafe chain.  

This location is bigger and nicer than most of the other locations. 

Food: 4-stars
Ambiance: 3.5-stars
Service: 3-stars
Value: 3-stars

I'm torn, cause I wanna give them 4-stars, but I just can't cause every time I come, I have to order two entrees/plates in order to get full as the portions are small/light, and I end up spending over $20 just on myself for breakfast or lunch. 

I like that their items are of high quality, but as they tend to be low on the amount of proteins they offer, I end up eating a double portion of carbs, usually bread, and then I'm hungry again in an hour.  

The price/value is just ok and service is generally slow at most locations. 

Overall, a great spot for lunch if you're looking for something light, however, their breakfast & dinner menus are somewhat limited on options that keep you full. 

My favorite items are the ham & cheese Quiche and the Avocado toast, but, better to come here for coffee and pastries as those are very good and well-priced for what you get."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-05-28,3,"The breakfast here was good but the service was not so good. They insisted we sit in the dining area for full service, but there were so many non-bused tables that we couldn't find tables together to make a 4 top. We ended up sitting in the counter service area, which is what we preferred. The workers didn't care for that and it showed. Avocado toast was very good."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-05-27,4,"Placed conveniently near some of the better hotels in east midtown, this location of LPQ is a pretty solid breakfast nook.  If you're looking for a really decadent muffin or treat, this is NOT the place for you.  However, it is a great option if you're looking for a little healthier start.

The first thing I noticed and appreciated when I walked in is that the calories for the various items are all listed up front.  The second thing I noticed was that they were pretty healthy, really.  Many of the breakfast pastry options seemed to clock in under 400 calories.  Once I ordered and got my blueberry muffin (clocking in a little higher at ~500cal), I discovered why.  The pastries definitely are a little more whole grain and overall less sweet than typical.  Still, they are tasty, and more importantly, filling.  Especially if you're going to be walking around a lot, it's good to have a little bit of weight to your meal.

I also ordered a hot chocolate, which was similarly less sweet than usual.  However, it actually came out at the perfect temperature for drinking, which shocked me.  Almost all places serve it scalding hot at first, so this was a very nice surprise.  It was a little thinner than normal (less dairy), but again, this fits with the philosophy of the place.

Actual ambiance is very typical NY breakfast shop.  This shop is actually a mini chain with locations in major US cities, but they've done a pretty good job blending in with the Manhattan feel.  Plenty of windows to look out and stare at people being more productive than you.  Tables are a little bit rustic which fits in with the french whole grain vibe they have going.  

Prices are typical NYC midtown.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but if you're not a frequent traveler/NYCer, you may be a little surprised.  Overall, a pretty good choice, especially if you're staying nearby."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-05-26,4,"I had time while getting my laptop repaired at the Apple store in Grand Central, so I decided to find breakfast and a place where I could read the paper. I walked in, and was told that I could sit wherever I like. I found a seat at a communal table, and was greeted by my server shortly after.  My server had a great smile and was super friendly, especially when needing help with ordering. The decor is very rustic and wooden, and filled with co-workers chatting over coffee and people having business lunches. I browsed the menu, which is filled with both sweet and savory choices for breakfast and lunch. I chose the chai latte with soy milk, and the fruit and yogurt parfait. Both were equally delicious, and I was glum when they were finished! 

Le Pain Quotidien is a my go-to spot that is always consistent - great food with fresh and healthy ingredients, and great service!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-05-12,3,"Came here for a weekday lunch - got the Quinoa salad with extra chicken - there wasn't a lot of chicken for $3 but it was a nice dish. My colleague got the tartine which was nice, although some cutlery would have been useful! We also got glasses with no water. However, the waiter was friendly. Their speciality lies in the bakery selection so go for those rather than a proper meal."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-03-28,4,"Wether you come here for their organic salads, soups or pastries, I highly suggest accompanying it with a delicious cappuccino or hot chocolate! 

Ambiance here is great. Hardwood floors, cute wooden tables with nice, big chairs and an overall very well-taken care of place. 

My friend and I had their delicious charcuterie board, with organic brie, blue cheese, prosciutto and sausage. The bread was warmly toasted, with delicious olive oil accompanying it. Definitely coming here again! 

Location wise: 15 min walk from Times square, in the heart of the city!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-03-19,4,Matt was really sweet and accommodating. Some of the servers I had to flag down or approach myself to get served. I felt as if I was annoying or asking too much. But the overall vibe felt chill and relax. Food is always great.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-02-06,4,"They have delicious coffee here. I got the waffles and avocado toast for breakfast. The waffles were small but filling, but they were a little too sweet. The avocado toast is amazing!!! By the way, they don't have omelettes here, which they usually have in the locations I go to in LA. And the hazelnut butter they bring on the side is delicious!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2015-01-14,4,"This place is very close to Grand Central terminal. Nice environment and awesome service! I ordered a spicy Apple cider, Steel cut oatmeal with bananas and walnuts and a cheese almond Danish. Everything was tasteful and healthy. Looking forward coming back soon!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-12-28,3,"Interesting little location around 44th and 6th, not far from the International Center of Photography.  The decor is wooden, homely, and beautiful.  Le Pain is a chain, but this one was entirely different from the one I visited in Connecticut.  For one, the bill was over $60, which appeared le pain-fully too much for two open-faced sandwiches, a coffee and a beer.  They seemed to run out of anything on the menu I actually wanted.
You don't have a maître d'hotel, or a hostess in Le Pain Quotidien, despite the fancy name, so you can sit anywhere--and the window location we picked was quite pleasant.  It was fun to watch tourists hustle in the cold streets, lit by the golden yellow rays of the winter sun slowly setting somewhere over the West side.
The restaurant also serves wine, and the waitress did her best to remember what we ordered--I'm pretty sure she was alone in the entire restaurant.  If you like simple cafes and open-face sandwiches, and like to overpay, this is definitely your place."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-12-24,4,"i am a breakfast guy when it comes to this place, never around during lunch, so lets talk about breakfast, from the yummy fresh assorted pastries, to. breads, hot and cold coffee drinks to teas, this is a nice treat , with prices that are kinda high but you get quality. plenty of communal tables , and small regular seating also. a friendly staff , just like any other location. must find the time to have lunch, cause the salads, sandwiches and soups look delicious. i did pick up a jar of blondie chocolate spread, for my weekend morning treat, that is yummy on a bagel or toast. this location has mostly tourist and locals from area. i must admit the brownies and crossiants are tops in taste and freshness. a decaff cappy and raisin danish , and blueberry muffin and i am in heaven. this chain joint is a solid pick for breakfast, and  for lunch. p.s they have table service and the servers are so on point in taking care of customers."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-11-29,5,"Wonderful little restaurant nestled in between Times Square and Grand Central Terminal. 

I don't think Yelp advertises the fact that LPQ has ORGANIC food, which has been hard for me to find in the city. 

I got the Spinach & Goat Cheese Frittata and it was wonderful, and paired with a side salad that had amazing dressing.

I also got the Three Bean Chili which was filling and delicious as well. It was topped with some avocado, and had fresh bread on the side.

When I come to the city I will definitely be talking a stop here again! Thank you for the amazing and speedy service!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-11-04,1,For pickup/ take away this is too expensive/slow compared to competition. Shame as food is good.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-10-08,4,"LOVE that this place opened two blocks from the office. It was my go-to place for quiet lunch meetings on the second floor. But I see the secret is out now; it's been crowded the last few times I went!  Can't go wrong with their open-faced sandwiches but  my achilles heal is the prosciutto / white bean salad. Mmm!  And the bread - sir, may I have another? The fruit tarts are divine too (wish they didn't post those calorie counts). I saw Le Pain in Paris during my last trip and that solidified my love for this place (how could you not love all things French??). Service here can be spotty. I'm sure they are busy but it's tough when you seat yourself upstairs and then are neglected (no menus, no water, no table setting); a small price to pay but be sure to have your order ready (and just ask for water) when the server eventually comes."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-08-26,4,"A terrific lunch.  I stopped by with a friend on a Monday afternoon and had a terrific experience.  The food was excellent, especially the salmon tartine.  The portion was a nice size but not too overwhelming.  The ambiance was very nice as well.  The decor was upscale but rustic at the same time, with some communal tables available.  We enjoyed a fresh lemonade and raspberry iced tea, although there was a nice selection of wines and cocktails.  Service was excellent as well.  We were seated right away and the staff was attentive and pleasant.  Our food came quickly after ordering and was presented quite nicely.  Overall it was a great lunch experience and I would definitely come back again.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a little bit nicer place to get lunch, but not too formal or costly."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-08-15,1,Came in with a group of people and received subpar service. The waitress did not ask how we wanted to split our check. She assumed that we would all be on one check and told us she couldn't run several debit cards for one check. Food portions were also small for the price.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-06-30,1,"Can I get to refill my coffee? But that's a to go cup. Are you dining in? Yes, I'm sitting right there at the table. You can't get a refill on a to go cup, only when you dining in. But I'm dining in and I was given a to go cup... Sorry you have to pay for your refill.

...this place SUCKS!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-06-27,1,"You must have table service to sit at the tables, but heres the catch. All the servers want to stand by the kitchen window, talk with one other, and only give u the food and never check on you, never refill your water, and never really do more than the bare minimum to get a tip. And over the past year (yes I have been here several times) there has been a growing population of South African girls as servers here, which they try to charm you with a accent but actually are horrible waiters. The manager of this place needs to get a clue who's she hiring, I think I would get the same quality of service driving through a mcdonalds window"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-06-11,1,Overhyped: dirty knifes & forks even with previous food visible! Bread even for a European taste more like concrete. Only one piece of butter for three leaves of bread! Disappointing! If we compare with this nice Mexican breakfast for 25$ around the corner really annoying for 50$!
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-05-15,3,"I guess between 3 and 4. Service kinda sucks but the food as good as any other LPQ in the city. 

The service is a 2 tops. 

But it's a good location and I am loving the strawberry lemonade for summer (140 cal). 

Friend had the strawberry mimosa with Chenin Blanc and seemed to like it. There are a few sandwiches I've never tried that I want to. My stand-by is the turkey and avocado sandwich. 

I would never go to this unless meeting someone who works around Grand Central. 

Very business crowd as you would expect. Quite different from UES or Lincoln Center locations."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-03-13,1,"Indifferent service, overpriced even for its location, given what's on offer: uncooked eggs and tepid tea. one to miss."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-03-06,4,LPQ is the perfect place for a business meeting or a quick snack. It's neither informal or formal. Plus their tartines and quiches are yummy and I LOVE their gazpacho.
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2014-01-23,3,"I love going to OTHER location for Le Pain Quotidien but this location always frustrates me.  And this time, I had to write a review.

I came in at lunch time and I realize that this is a busy time.  I patiently waited behind a customer while she made her choice, she paid but there was some issue with her credit card.  There was an issue and it was resolved and the counter person apologized for the wait and I said that it was fine, I understood.  I then placed my order for a medium spiced belgian hot chocolate and a brioche.

I waited for my order and the woman who made it gave me a ""small belgian hot chocolate""  I was confused as I had ordered medium and the counter person came over and I said I thought I had ordered medium.  He said ""we only have two sizes.""  Ok, but you could have told me that when I ordered.  I said fine, I understand.  I mean, what could I do.

I left and tasted the drink and realized it wasn't the spiced one.  I came back and said this is supposed to be spiced and the woman started to make a new one.  Another waiter spoke up and said the difference between them was one was spiced and one wasn't.  DUH.  I said, yes, but I can taste the difference.  

The counter person noticed I was back and I said that I had ordered a spiced Belgian and he got all flustered and basically made me feel as if it was my fault.  The spiced Belgian hot chocolate was very watery, I should have kept the other one.  

Not going back to this location."

Sure the menu is not going to truly excite you, but they are good at what they do. The tartines, soups, salads, and quiches are refreshing and delicious while eating bread with a variety of spreads is simply fun.

When you run out of lunch ideas or are suffering from sensory overload due to excessive amounts of  restaurant dining, Le Pain Quotidien is the best cure!"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2013-12-29,2,"I would not recommend this place unless you like French cuisine. My omelet was brown (overlooked) and they do not have sell any kind if soda- lemonade, tea, juice or coffee only. Wasn't impressed by ANYTHinG we ordered."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2013-12-14,4,"I stop in occasionally for a coffee or a pastry and it has never disappointed! Service is friendly and quick which is a major plus especially when I'm on the run.

Get the little tartlets here if you are craving something sweet.  The blueberry and chocolate truffle ones are my favorite."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2013-12-14,5,"I luv this place, hidden between Vanderbilt and 5th ave, cute decorations, well presented food, love the Cobb salad and the coconut macaroons :)"
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2013-11-22,1,"The service here is terrible. The lady behind the counter is moody and is often on a mission to bring each person she encounters to a low. I will not be returning, even if I get paid to step in there. No, thank you."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2013-11-05,4,"This place is awesome, I don't know if it was because i just walked out of a rude restaurant or if I was that hungry. But the food is organic/vegan rustic french style. The wait staff was great, a tad on the slow side but it was busy when I was there too. I really liked this place."
95,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-144,2013-10-12,5,"A very decent breakfast spot. Good location, fresh food. Not a lot on the menu, but what they have, they do well. Not the best breakfast ever but a good step above diner food. 

The frittata was quite good, and the salad with it was awesome. Super fresh. They had excellent tea too. You can get tea or coffee by the pot. You have a choice in sitting at the communal dining table or smaller tables, but the communal table is very cool. Makes you feel like you are in Europe or something.

Staff was friendly and very helpful. I also enjoy the atmosphere of the place. At no time do you feel rushed. A very comfortable breakfast spot indeed. A little expensive, but you are in the heart of midtown - frittata and pot of tea for $20 with tip. I will return!"
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2019-12-04,3,"Engaging is Oren's logo and storefront.  Limited seats by the window.  Wanted a short break, this place looked promising for there was a line this mid-afternoon.  Liked immediately the coziness of this spot and the energy emitted from the pulsating music being played.  Though nonchalant, friendly and fast was the service.  Not the best but nice enough were my sips of their freshly made, piping hot, and, frothy, ""Chai Latte"".  With its convenience and ambience, I'd drop in again when in area next!

Cheers!"
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2019-05-28,5,"So I was introduced to this coffee shop by a friend two blocks from my school and it's been my go to ever since. I don't indulge often because I like the full effects from caffeine when I drink it, and when I do i want it excessively strong. I've gone about every week or so during the semester and always look forward to my iced latte. 

A couple of months in I found out they have oat milk which I opted to add one day- and it changed the entire game for me. Love me some plant based milk as dairy and I don't always agree with each other but the texture in oat milk stands out in such a divine way, creamy, nutty, and delicious. It complements those 3 espresso shots in an unimaginable way- if you've been skeptical about trying it (you're a little crazy... it's just made from oats and water) you have to give it a chance. 

The staff are quick, effective, and know their java, and they also have a matcha powder for those who enjoy it as well. Herbaceous, and flavorful, also has a great boost of caffeine and a slightly lighter take on a latte, which is just as refreshing. Love it here."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2018-09-12,5,Wonderful coffee shop!! Great coffee and super friendly service.  It's my neighborhood go to place.
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2018-08-10,4,Tried the regular latte and an almond milk latte - both were excellent. Great alternative to Starbucks.
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2018-05-15,5,"Visited Oren's for the first time with a friend who loves coffee! We were serviced fast and efficiently. My coffee was amazing. No need for creamer or sugar. Very dark, rich, robust flavors."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2018-03-10,4,"Had a great dirty chai here, and they include 2 espresso shots in the few for the ""dirty"". A little Pricey at almost 6.50 but definitely was a great beverage. Really would give 3.75 price because of price."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2018-01-19,4,"Iced caramel macchiato is a classic, but be ready to pay $5 for it! Cute coffee shop vibe, but there really isn't seating"
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2017-12-04,1,"Oren's on 72nd and Lex? Run! RUN! Run! COSTUMER SERVICE sucks! So sad:( This small coffee shop was nice. They got rid of all the old school employees and now they have all these young employees who don't even know the words..""good morning"". As soon as you walk into the store they greet you with ATTITUDE. Why? Because I want coffee? Isn't that your job? Even if you tip them, they have ATTITUDE! Who wants to waste their $10 on a cup of coffee with their terrible costumer service?"
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2017-11-06,1,"I've found with Orens all over the city the staff is hit and miss, some friendly, some downright hostile. (This is not an issue with Joe, Blue Bottle, Starbucks or other places where they think being nice is important.) When I entered today this crew was making fun of a customer who'd just left, and I was glad to know I'd be the target once I was gone. Got the good old 'What Do You Want' head nod rather than a hello... okay, this is New York, fine. When I asked if they had almond milk, the charmer said ""YES, we have almond milk"" with full-on attitude. At least the cashier was slightly more happy to be there, actually thanking me. The worst part was that the coffee itself was undrinkable. Granted, it's a very warm late fall day so it was off-season for iced coffee, but still no excuse for selling stale-tasting garbage. Got it with almond milk which also tasted off - it separated in the cup like spoiled milk. Honestly I avoid Orens most of the time but I was in a hurry and it was on the way but I won't make that mistake again. Seriously, there are so many coffee places now that actually want your business and care about their product so it's worth walking a block or two out of the way not to be sneered at and charged good money for garbage. Give Orens a miss."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2017-08-12,4,"I really like the diversity of coffee.I'm coffee lover and very picky with the quality of coffee. I tried the Guatemala coffee. The acidity is perfect, good body and perfect temperature. Very nice guys."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2017-04-24,1,No smiles. No Good morning welcome. No thank you. Your morning staff looks and acts miserable. They also gossip about other employees in front of customers. I won't be back.
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2017-04-16,5,"Great iced coffees & lattes. The staff was always friendly with me. However, the cashier did yell at her fellow barista for a small mistake, in front of everyone. Something about the way she placed the cups that were being made? It made me sad for the barista."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2017-01-14,5,"Great coffee joint in the upper east side. The staff deals with a lot of ""interesting"" customer issues, but their coffee is high quality and delicious. Small company with their own beans is a must in order to combat the machine of other coffee corporations. I highly recommend you dodge other coffee for a taste of Oren's Daily Roast."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2017-01-04,1,Didn't  realize that you would have to be specific in ordering coffee..supposedly they have organic coffee..bought coffee today..that taste like poison. I tried many times.. I  've ask for a cafe latte and I always end up being disappointed.. It tasted  bitter...
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2016-05-05,4,Small but busy location.  fast service and their coffee is excellent - much better than Starb or Joe.  Im a reg
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2016-04-08,1,"I came into Oren's after craving a good coffee or hot warm beverage. They disappointed me to a whole different extreme. I ordered a chai latte and it tasted like frothed milk got mixed with an artificial chai flavor. I mean I shouldn't have expected much when I saw them ""pump"" the chai in. 

The place is the size of a closet, which wouldn't matter as much if they were bringing quality beverages but obviously they are not. 

Before I ordered it I asked the woman what a chai latte was.. Her response, ""milk with some chai stuff"" I mean really? I guess I had higher expectations with prices like starbucks they did not deliver. Over four dollars on a beverage that doesnt warm you up inside is a complete waste of money. 

Go somewehere else."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2016-04-05,5,"My neighborhood spot! Nothing fancy, but it's a great little spot and reliably consistent.

96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2016-02-18,3,"Coffee is good. Espresso drinks are good too. Staff is nice save the guy with glasses at the 1st ave and 81st St location - he's weird. 

My only complaint is the music at all the locations. It's fucking awful, radio friendly, trite music. Its music for people that need to be spoon fed their taste in music. I've been sitting here for half an hour and I've had the displeasure of having to listen to the fucking black eyed peas, the fucking white stripes, Rihanna's big hit from 200?, endless vocoder tracks that don't have any place outside a disco while not on some drug that will ultimately result in you getting an std. Uhhp, here we go Florence and the machine, you have the musical taste of a ""now that's what I call music, 2 CDs for 19.95$"" commercial."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2016-01-21,5,Great place for anyone stopping by to get your coffee or espresso beverage . Their pastries are pretty good too . The staff are very good and on point . I highly recommend this place for anyone wants to grab a quick beverage on the go.
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2015-12-12,4,"Coffee was great; muffin was also alright, minus the stale cornflakes on top. Odd combination. Fast service, affordable & better alternative to Starbucks."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2015-09-25,5,"If I were living in Paris, I'd have a cigarette, an espresso, and a croissant for breakfast. But being a non-smoker and living in NYC (where croissants can get rather pricey), I go to Oren's for a latte instead. 
Cute little place with fantastic espresso. If you're the type to douse your beverage with sugar, STOP IT! Whatever beans they use are so fragrant and delicious that sugar would just ruin it. If you're in the neighborhood or at one of their chains, give it a go! You won't regret it.
Plus: Super friendly staff."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2015-09-10,4,"Oren's is a place I get my tea, not coffee. Go figure. Ha. Their tea's are great especially the spring jasmine tea. Omg its amazing. This definitely helps me start my day right. The staff is super friendly. I love the fact that the store conveniently opens at 7am. Just when I need my tea. Their sizes have changed and the prices went up. Still this place is a nice lil coffee shop."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2014-12-04,4,"good espresso...strong at the beginning, a bit bitter. approved!  still not 5 stars cause i consider there's better tasting ones in the city"

96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2014-07-27,4,"One of the better alternatives for Starbucks in the neighborhood (If you were looking for one). 
The baristas are quick and friendly.  
The prices are decent.
I've been going there for about a year and half since I go to school nearby, haven't really ordered anything but the ""coffee of the day"" so I can't tell you much (but the coffee is great). 
If you plan on coming here often, be sure to get a member card to swipe everytime you buy, you'll get a free cup after 10 cups of coffee."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2013-10-31,3,"Cute coffee spot on the UES. Right on my way to work, I've stopped by a few times to get my daily caffeine fix. The inside is very small and can kinda get cramped when busy. There's no seating-- it's more of a grab and go type of deal. Their daily house coffee is always piping hot and delicious. Staff is friendly and attentive to customers. Also, if you're in need of a new coffee mug, they have quite the interesting selections on the wall when you first walk in. Oren's is a nice little pit-stop if you're looking for a good cup of coffee."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2013-10-21,2,"This location has gone downhill. The service is now unfriendly and the coffee inconsistent.
What really annoyed me about today's visit was that they were advertising a gift card promo on their chalkboard (get $50 if you add $40 to your card), so I went in with my stroller (very difficult since there is a very high step to get in there). I mentioned I was adding the $40 to my card to get $50, and I ordered a coffee. Only AFTER the coffee was made did they mention that the promo ended yesterday. I pointed out that they were still advertising it on the chalkboard outside, and they still did not honor it. I was pleasant and polite, and they were just plain rude about it. No apologies and no explanations.
That is bad service. And the coffee was not as good as usual, adding insult to injury.
Very disappointed in the direction this location has taken, and I've been coming here for YEARS."

Maybe the bad service was just the timing, or maybe it's just how Oren's does things, but we ordered a large blended drink, a piece of cake, and a cup of tap water, and we were charged for the tap water. I remember looking at the machine, thinking, ""it would really be something if they charged us for the cup of water,"" and of course, there was the charge. I asked, ""do you guys really charge for tap water?"" The barista's response was, ""yeah, sorry."" We weren't informed that there would be a charge, neither were we given an option if we still wanted the cup of water after finding out for ourselves that it had a price tag. It was pretty shady to try and sneak that charge in on us -- shame shame shame..."

Their coffee is really good - Latte is much better than your usual Starbucks. Tea is also good. Staff is pretty cool and friendly. In addition to coffee beans they also sell coffee and tea related items such a pots, mugs, etc. For the kids - or the kid in you - they have this super huge cookies that are really good in case of a sugar injection need!"

Dropped in last night right before it was closing and still managed to get a tasty cup of their daily house coffee. This location is tiny with nowhere to really sit as it's almost basically a coffee stand in a storefront, but with all the normal snacks and baked goods they usually carry along with their coffees and teas. Staff is pretty friendly here too and didn't try to rush me when I was trying to figure what I wanted considering it was near closing time. Always a good alternative to Starbucks."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2012-07-12,3,"Hmmm, Oren's....The staff is super sweet and chill.  I tried my first chai tea from Oren's and now I'm a believer.  The woman sold me at, ""It's delicious"".  What can I say, I'm a marketer's dream. Anyway, the store is quite small, so sorry claustrophobes, this may not be the venue for you.  Oren's has a tiny sitting area but you're better off taking your sips with you.  I go here on occasion and bring my tea or coffee to school since it's a couple of blocks away.  The selection is outstanding and way better than Cashbucks (Starbucks).  There is a small choice of nibbles and bits to go with your drink.  Oh, the staff doesn't keep you waiting either - definitely a plus, especially when you're on the go."

I like the mochaccino for days when I'm craving something sweet in my coffee. If not, then my regular drink is a caramel latte! The price for a medium isn't too bad. They also have a nice selection of teas for those sick days/sore throat days. 
I come here when I don't want to walk to Starbucks."

I absolutely love the coffee here (not too strong and not too weak, unless you request your coffee stronger or weaker of course).  The prices are fair (easily less than Starbucks).  

The only dilemma preventing the fifth star is the size of this coffee house.  I'm okay with a non-sitting location but if more than 5 people are in line then you are that guy basically holding the door open for everyone else.  

And when you do finally get in, you have to move around a bit because while in line and working your way to the register people getting their coffee orders have to reach over the line because there is no pickup counter (like or dislike Starbucks, they make sense... order at one end and pick up on the other end).  

They also have a door to the basement in the floor where everyone is in line and they open and close the door often so you should watch your step;  don't be the guy that falls in.  

The coffee, the friendly staff and the prices more than make up for the mini-location."
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2011-10-16,4,"It's a basically a coffee stand it's so small, but they're serving the usual great Oren's coffee, and they have the usual cookie and baked good selections. I recommend the giant ginger cookie to go with your americano."

96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2010-03-27,5,"It's a grab-and-go kind of place, since it's closet-sized . There are 2.5 seats there, so if you really want to have your coffee there, then you could. 

Coffee is GREAT! I take mine black, so I'm very sensitive to the aroma of the coffee. They also sell awesome coffee mugs, everything tea-/coffee-preparation related, pastry, chocolates. 

It does not have a feel of a chain coffee store, so that's a plus. And everything is like it's 10c  cheaper than in infamous Starbucks."

I just had a cup of their daily brew and a friend had a cafe au lait - both were fairly yummy. I've had Oren's coffee from their location at Grand Central, and this brew was a lot better. 

However, as warned - we had to wait for a while as there were about six people in front of us. I don't mind a wait, except there's no room here to stand patiently. You constantly have to shuffle around people trying to come and go....forget about actually sitting to enjoy your drink or bringing more than one friend. Claustrophobia inducing coffee, aye aye!"
96,orens-daily-roast-new-york-12,2008-02-19,4,I adore their hot chocolate but depending on who makes it you may need additional sugar. They have a card which you can stamp and makes it worth your buck to remember it upon purchase. I didn't really like the espresso caramel candy and found them overpriced. I also had strange feelings that I'm the only sucker to buy candy and that they were sitting there for ages.
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-12-06,1,"Overcharged me for what I ordered. A $11 sandwich, $7 soup, and $4 croissant somehow came out to over $32. They didn't give me a receipt either. I only noticed afterwards on my card transaction."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-11-05,1,"This past Sunday, I ordered a large iced caramel latte. Given that the total cost was $6.64 (above average, even by New York standards), I expected a high quality beverage. Upon sitting down and tasting my latte, I was annoyed to find that not only could I not taste even a hint of caramel flavor, but the drink did not even taste like an espresso beverage. Instead, it tasted as if I was drink a large glass of off-brand whole milk. 

No problem - I walked back to the counter and asked for an additional espresso shot and explained that the drink did not taste like it was made correctly. The male cashier snapped at me and told me ""that's how it's supposed to taste! If you want it changed I'm going to charge you."" 

I've been drinking a latte daily for the last decade and this is the first time in years I have asked to have one adjusted for poor taste. Despite the employee's pretentious attitude, I complied and paid an additional $1.36 for an additional espresso shot. Mind you, I find it inappropriate for a barista to scold me and tell me that I don't know what a latte is supposed to taste like. 

The male cashier then put my cup on the table behind him, and I waited approximately 13 minutes for the additional espresso shot (while the ice continued to melt into my drink). The cashier then realized he had forgotten the make the espresso shot (since my used cup and straw were now sitting on the drink counter behind the register while they focused on making fresh drinks for other customers - is this even sanitary?), and apologized. 

Instead of making me a new drink at this point, he handed back the watered-down beverage to me, and my ice had now melted. Totally disgusting and undrinkable.

Epicerie Boulud tout themselves as serving high quality beverages (at a high quality price) but this was by far the worst latte I've ever tasted (and ironically, the most expensive, at $8.00)."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-09-25,1,"So here is what exactly happened, I ordered a Tea .. Hot Tea. I was given a Cold black tea full of Ice, I asked the person on the counter that there is a mistake I asked for a HOT tea not cold. He said no problem he put his hand in the plastic cup and removed the ice cubes. Shifted that tea in another container and was trying to heat up using the steam from the coffee machine....Instead, of making a fresh cup. I told him that is unhygienic and just plain wrong .....He never budged ....I dumped the tea and walked off instead of drinking that tea ... Rude staff ... and they kept $5"
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-09-21,3,"Epicerie Boulud is one of several restaurants/cafes underneath the Plaza Hotel. It gives off a French cafe atmosphere with marbled counters and plenty of cute baked goods. You place your order by the counter, and then can choose to sit by the bar or nearby tables. They have ready-made cold sandwiches and drinks by the fridge, and they create hot sandwiches upon ordering. 

Flank-steak sandwich - the portions were much bigger than I had anticipated, which is always a plus! Roast beef was medium rare, and the bread-to-filling proportion was well-matched. The house mustard complemented the bread and meat with a tangy note. Since this was a hot sandwich, it took the longest to arrive at our table. 
Salmon sandwich - This was the most disappointing aspect of our meal. The salmons sandwich was more expensive than the flank steak one, and it was at least half the size of it. Definitely cannot get full with this order.
Carrot cake - we ordered it because it was adorably shaped like a carrot cube, green fondant stems and all. The inside was a carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. 
Prosecco - surprisingly pleasant and good quality. Happy hour from 5 pm until close (8 pm)!

Since it's a fast-casual setting, our food came at disparate times. It is a bit pricey (everything at the Plaza Food Hall is), but we thoroughly enjoyed most of our food and service here."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-07-13,5,"This place is so adorable and the service was amazing! Anthony did a very good job! He recommended some great food for me and my family and he took care of us attentively. Not only was the service great overall, the food was also to die for. Super reasonable prices and enjoyed every bit of my time here. I would highly recommend this place. The cubano was perfection."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-06-14,1,So gross. Their chai latte was super watery. Ask for no ice got tons of ice. Wished I spend my money on one of their coffees instead. Gross
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-06-10,3,"The servers are very nice. I had a vegetable quiche which was OK, but looked much better than it tasted. My main complaint about this place is they serve everything on disposable dishes with plastic covers, even if you tell them you want to eat there. So if you are trying to make sustainable choices eat somewhere else!"
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-04-19,1,"This is actually at the underground floor after you enter the shop. A bit hard to find if you don't know where you are going or you're a tourist from LA like me. 

I went to order a cup of cappuccino from them because they seem pretty reputable when competing with other coffee stands within the same shop.

Their coffee is slightly more expensive than the other stands, but that's fine. Until I realize they only filled up 2/3 or half of my cup with coffee. 

The service lady didn't seem to care, and I didn't bother to ask assuming they knew what they're doing. 

The cup was extremely light when she handed to me, maybe that's how New Yorkers drink their coffee. But if I paid extra $0.50 for an large I expect my large coffee to be full? Or else I would've just ordered a small. 


The coffee was good but a huge disappointment on their part. 


Also their service was pretty unfriendly and unwelcoming. I'd say if you are in customer service you should probably at least smile? But what do I know. 
However super clean booth!"
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-04-11,3,The review is strictly on their carrot cake loaf.  Taste good except they were stingy with the frosting.  I am also disappointed how they did not add raisins to the loaf.  For 18 dollars they could have done better.
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-03-05,3,"The food is really good, and yeah it's a little on the pricey side for counter service but it's worth it. I really like the food court here. It's classy and not overly crowded. That's the good. 
The bad: The staff is a little bitchy which is unfortunate for a higher quality establishment. Also, if you just want a splash of soymilk in your $5 iced coffee that'll be an extra 82 cents please. I mean i get it, maybe, for a latte but for just a splash in my coffee? That's petty. For those two reasons I bumped this from 5 stars to 3."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-03-01,3,"Searching for something extraordinary in a star studded chef food hall, options available were many on a Monday morning.  As I settled on what I though was something a bit off the beaten path for breakfast, instead of a sandwich/bagel or a bakery item, I went with a quiche which looked like it could be special.  Of three options available, I went with a recommendation from the staff in choosing the version with Jambon ham.  

The quiche was certainly presented well and included some small greens on the side.  Nicely browned on top, as you cut through the quiche, large chunks of Jambon was present throughout.  Other than the ham component, the rest of the quiche lacked any seasoning, which I thought could have been improved if the ham chunks were chopped smaller.  Given the price point, I would have expected a little more precision.   

The chai latte was really disappointing.  There was barely any hint of chai flavor.  I immediately reached for sugar to provide some flavor.    

Epicure Boulud's presentation was pretty and service personable however not much else to rave about other than that."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2019-02-11,1,"Love when I go to a place and the servers don't seem interested / don't know names of specific items on display.
If I don't know something I will atleast try asking around rather than smirking and shrugging. 
Their cappuccino is average to say the least, items on display looked stale. My pecan cookie was dry any brittle.. obviously stale
Mediocrity paired with attitude has no redemption.
Write off.."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2018-12-26,1,They don't have any knowledge and customer service was worse! Excuse me a hot drink in an ice cup and as well as hot water what's is wrong with u guys hello!!!
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2018-12-23,3,"The service was kind of rude and took a while to order even though I stood there for some time while they were scrolling through their phone. Got the coffee and also the pistachio black cherry, they tasted pretty good but the gelato has a bit of a grainy texture. Not really sure if that's a good or bad thing, I personally liked it at first but towards the end it started to feel a little weird. 
Pretty pricey, was $4 for one scoop and $7 for 2."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2018-12-21,4,"Stopped into the Plaza Food Court with my nephew for a little holiday cheer. We settled on this place and were pleasantly surprised. First of all, Camilla our server, was so nice, cheerful, friendy, and accomodating. She offered us the happy hour wines which were a great bargain at $5/glass and promptly took our food order. We both had the cubano sandwich (mine without bread) and could not get over how delicious it was! Overall this was a great experience and Camilla helped to make it a memorable one."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2018-12-14,5,"I was looking for a breakfast place and in the food plaza everthing else was closed around 9am. I ordered one nutella croissant and a latte from here. Although they had great things like sandwiches, soups and other baked goods on display but the nutella croissant was more appealing. Coffee was great but the star is the nutella croissant. Not too much filled with nutella, it had the perfect amount and pastry was crisp as it should be. It looked great and tasted amazing."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2018-10-07,5,"Looking for a quick bite, sandwiches and pastries, or just a really good and strong double espresso? Épicerie Boulud in the plaza food court is the place. 
Extremely pleasant atmosphere, and if you seat at the bar you get served right away. This is my Third visit and all experiences were worth 5 stars. I recommend the chicken BLT sandwich accompanied by double espresso, and if you got the sweet tooth, try the chocolate croissant.
Perfect place to take a little break from the crazy pace of the city and treat yourself to an oasis in the heart of Manhattan."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2018-08-25,1,"Bummer. I thought the Plaza was a place with only high quality shops, but what a mistake it was to take my family to this one. We are visiting from across the country and I insisted on wandering through the famed hotel. We stopped at this cafe because it looked good, but it wasn't. The macarons were freezer burned and flavorless, nothing like one would expect from a FRENCH cafe. I bought my daughter a glass of Prosecco and she immediately said, ""Ick. Cooks."" Meaning poured from a $5 bottle. My Malbec, if possible, was worse. And served in plastic cups? I'm so, so sorry we spent $ there and my view of the Plaza has diminished because of it."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2018-01-19,1,"Took a raspeberry and pistacchio tart
The thing is still frozen when I start to eat it, no taste.

I am really disappointed by the patisseries in this place"
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2017-10-29,4,"Looking for a quick-ish breakfast before heading over to the Met and we stopped in here. 
It was quite busy and the line(s) were a little intimidating. 
This is one of those places where you have to stand in different lines for different services, one to order, another to pay, another to wait for your beverage, etc. 

I got the ""breakfast sandwich"" with bacon. I can't say exactly what was on it but there as definitely cheese and egg and bacon, and it was REALLY GOOD. It felt justified paying $8 for it, that's how good it was. I also go a matcha lemonade which even a small was probably close to 16oz. That was good too, but towards the bottom there were clumps of matcha so it got a little bitter. 

My friend got the spinach quiche which came with a small salad, and a hot coffee. She said both were good. 

I'd come back if I was in the area. All of the pasties looked really delicious and I'd love to try them."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2017-09-20,4,The customer service is phenomenal! The coffee is freshly roasted and freshly made. I had an Americano and a macaroon. They were both delicious. I appreciate the high quality service. It reflects the price as well.
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2017-07-22,4,"All I can say about this is that it is clean and is quite fast. I paid $8 for oatmeal which I feel is quite outrageous, but I needed food and didn't want to pay $18 for it so I guess it gave me what I need and was actually pretty good."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2017-06-21,1,"Impolite incompetent workers. No one knew what they were doing. Poor customer service. So much eye rolling, and just pure nastiness. My chai latte was disgusting and my friend's cappuccino was also disgusting. I seriously had such a crap experience with the people working there I wish they would all get fired. The cashier repeatedly ignored my and my friend and wouldn't take our orders. Her coworkers had to ask her to help us and she just looked over and rolled her eyes and looked passed us and asked if she could help anyone else. Then another lady came and took over and helped us. And the rude girl went to make drinks while the other lady worked the register. No one gave the girl with the attitude making drinks the right orders so she was making the wrong drinks for us and she was becoming even more rude. A place like this should not have these types of people working here. My friend isn't from this country and his english is not so good. They were very impatient about it... Oh but the macaroons are good. I almost forgot about the macaroons."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2017-04-25,3,"Eh... it wasn't as good as I hoped. I got the raspberry pistachio tart which the cashier told me was the most popular pastry item. It was rather pricy and also fell short on my expectations. The pistachio creme was pretty bland and the raspberries were a weird flavor/texture combination with it. The ""tart"" pastry was just some flakes thrown at the bottom of the plastic cup if came in.  On the bright side it did look very pretty."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2017-03-20,3,Located in a very crowded shops area. Raspberry tart was little disappointing.
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2017-01-20,5,Discovered this incredible gem earlier this week. My boyfriend and I sat down at the bar and we were promptly greeted. We were excited to see the great/affordable wine and beer options! We enjoyed our experience plan on coming back and trying the French Chardonnay! A true bar secret of midtown!
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2017-01-20,5,"I had a great experience at Epicerie Boulud this past week. I am a repeat customer but I am always pleasantly surprised by the hospitable service, the speed in getting my order, and the consistency in it being correct. I have never had any complaints and am always warmly greeted by the friendly staff.

I will continue to visit the cafe weekly!"
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2017-01-04,4,"In the shops area (i.e. basement) of the Plaza Hotel. Very busy, crowded, confusing area so when we ducked in here, we were lucky to snag some stools at the counter. It was lunchtime on a cold winter day so we decided on hot sandwiches and soup. The service was prompt, the selection was pretty good, and the items we ordered were delicious. The price was reasonable (~$9 for a Cuban sandwich) but I wish they didn't serve canned sodas. (How hard is it to get a fountain drink around here??) Didn't try any of the desserts or pastries, but this was a good quick lunch option while doing some Christmas shopping."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2017-01-02,1,Service is slow very disfunction.  Where is danial Boulde?
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-12-29,2,"Pastries are good, cappuccino is bad, the staff are incompetent and indifferent  The owner must have forgotten about this place."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-11-18,2,"Please train your staff not to handle food and money with the same hands. It's so completely unhygienic when they close my coffee cup after handling the register. 

Inefficient to the point of driving you crazy but yummy.  Good coffee, soups, pastries, & sandwiches.  Relatively pleasant ambiance.  It takes five minutes per order to checkout though + 15 min to get order, I often decide the time commitment for a cup of coffee and a pastry is not worth it."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-09-10,1,"Disappointing breakfast sandwich. Advertises bechamel but they ""ran out of it"" (funny it was 9am). Attendant did not let us know but when questioned she offered butter instead as ""bechamel is just butter..."". I'm sure Daniel would disagree! Ham was cold inside. Overpriced for its quality."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-09-05,1,"Everything was great except the fact that the guy who served me gelato was being such an ass hole. He served someone who ordered after me who was obviously nice model like looking and I patiently waited. I just ordered from the cafe area and the woman pointed at that guy and said he will get me the ice cream. He was all yelling at me and saying that I have to show him the reciept. The girl who charged me never gave me one. Anyway, he decided that he will serve me after everyone else's order. Took forever felt like an eternity. Then he only gave me like half portion of what he gave the previous person and it was really sad looking. He said that the pistachio flavor is usually the soft one but it was too hard he only gave me half scoop. Not worth my $4. If you are not a model looking or Asian, avoid this place."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-08-23,4,"Excellent sorbet & Gelato, HOWEVER, minus a star for lack of signage. 

Everything looks lovely & will most likely be delicious, based on my multiple taste experiences at this location & the Broadway/West 66 or 67th street/Lincoln Center area location. 

What I don't appreciate is my time being wasted when I'm on a lunch break from work. So, please, have some lovely signage, since no one tells you that you should first pay for your gelato or sorbet, rather than wait in front of the beautiful sorbet display, thinking you're waiting on a line to be next, when you are not.  

Ok, so after learning that I should pay in advance, & moving over to the register line so that I can pay, waiting for folks to decide on their food & pastry selections, waiting for the customer in front of me to walk over to the refrigerated foods & first decide what he wants, while those on line have to wait for his decision--he was trying to be quick--& ...OK, so now, it's my turn to order & pay...I decide on an ice coffee & a 1-scoop sorbet....great, now I can go to the sorbet display, only a few steps away from this register.... I got my sorbet, & what do I see, DUE TO A LACK OF SIGNAGE??!!!  Two men are getting gelato & they have NOT PAID YET.  So they got their gelato and then went to pay.  I am not on vacation like some of the visitors here, I am on my little lunch hour break from work, trying to make my lunch break feel like a mini-vacation, so, Chef Boulud, please, help me to pretend I'm on vacation for just a little bit of my lunch time when I'm enjoying your delicious sorbet or gelato; please work on this. 

Chef Boulud, please, please, have some lovely signage, or have a dedicated staff person who can tell customers they need to pay first and then get gelato.

There is no question that any item purchased at Epicure Boulud will be 5-star. I have enjoyed wonderful assorted selections at the Lincoln Center area location & so far, at the Plaza location, I've enjoyed a very good ice coffee & a great & beautiful RUBY PEACH PASSION FRUIT SORBET--EXCELLENT!!  

I would prefer to do without the added stress due to a lack of information on procedures for ordering & paying. The lovely PLAZA FOOD HALL can be quite busy at times, so anything done to smooth out the ordering/paying process is much appreciated especially by those folks who work in the area, & enjoy escaping to the Plaza Food Halls for wonderful edible delights. 

Overall: You will be delighted with any edibles from Epicure Boulud. Food creations-excellent! Enjoy!

DEFINITELY TRY SOMETHING FROM HERE!!!  
The pastries are works of art! 
Gelato & Sorbet are refreshing! 

Room for improvement:yes, to smooth out ordering/paying."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-08-09,2,"Oh Epicerie Boulud, I wanted to like you, I really did. Given the name, I expected a lot. I know this isn't Daniel, but still, it should at least be a step above other fast casual options. It's also conveniently located across the street from my office, so it had potential. 

My steak panini was nothing more than mediocre, unfortunately. The meat was unpleasantly fatty and chewy - too tough for a sandwich. Reading some of the other reviews, perhaps I might have been better off choosing a pastry from here instead?

Also, not exactly a deal breaker, but I did find their customer service lacking. When my order was ready, I was simply handed a sandwich wrapped in paper. There was no offer of a bag to put it in or even napkins."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-07-14,4,Just stopped for something quick the apple honey cake sits on the counter when i ordered i thought it would come from the back somewhere but then she cut a piece from the one on the counter and I thought this is going to be stale but to my surprise it was very moist and tasty OMG I wanted the whole thing. Will be back to try other things and for another slice hope its always that good.
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-05-23,2,"2.5 stars for their almond croissants

the flavor is there but on the two occasions I've eaten them the bottom of the croissant is really soggy which is disappointing 

for almost 5$ I'd expect a lot more"
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-03-21,5,"A bit hard to find with a very hipster like feel in brand marketing this place and the food samplings offered in the court are most accomplished.
The Canele' from this place moved me.
There will never be a visit to NYC without one or more of these.
Amazing."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-03-16,3,"Super cute located in the Plaza Food Hall.  The food is very pretty, and the prices reflect that.  It ain't cheap, and I don't know if I'd seek it out... but it also was the most delicious slice of quiche I'd ever tasted.  Perfection.  We went for the croissants, and though they were exceedingly beautiful, they didn't spring to the top of the best thing I've ever eaten list.  Yes, I think Nutella in a croissant is a great idea, and when I found a tiny hidden pocket of it... it was delicious.  But the chocolate isn't evenly spread throughout the pastry, so was ultimately disappointing."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-02-15,2,"I had one of the best gingersnap cookies I've ever tasted. All of the sweets looked delicious but the sandwiches and salads looked positively anemic and tasted the same. I had the cobb salad which looked like it was made with Oscar Meyer turkey. I also had a chai latte that was served at room temperature and was weak. When I told the girl behind the counter, she didn't say a word. It would have been so easy to say she was sorry or to take the drink off my bill, but I just got a blank stare. This took a 3-star review down to 2. Mr. Boulud would not approve."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-02-12,2,"A disappointment. 
Had the most watery chai latte I've ever tasted. 
My spouse's Assam tea was extremely weak. 
The only redeeming factor- Muesli cookie was buttery, although my spouse found it dry."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2016-01-20,2,"I stopped by the Plaza Food Hall for a quick lunch near Central Park. I wish I had gone to another restaurant. I had a the spiced flank steak sandwich, my wife had the Cubano, my daughter the 1/2 grilled cheese and tomato soup, and my niece the Grilled Chicken BLT. The flank steak was medium rare and was a bit too chewy for a sandwich. The spices seemed off with a bit of smoky chile and a lot of what seemed to be horseradish. The filings added a sweetness to the sandwich that was also off. Overall I would not order it again. My wife enjoyed her Cubano. The pickles were better than usual store -bought and the mustard was spicy with good texture. I have had much better, but it was ok and she enjoyed it. My daughter had a pretty standard grilled cheese and tomato soup. She was particularly happy with the soup and liked that it was thick. My niece's grilled chicken BLT was a cold sandwich. It was big and the favors were good but the bread didn't quite fit so much of the fillings came out. The service was a little awkward but they were nice and the food was served quickly. They only have small tables so it is hard to get a group to sit together. The portions are big. If you got sides most people could share a sandwich. That is a good thing since for four sandwiches and tap water we paid $56. That is a pretty high bill for a mediocre lunch, even in Manhattan."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2015-11-21,5,"This 5 star review is based solely on the most amazing breakfast pastry ever, their raspberry chocolate croissant. It is buttery, flaky, chocolatey, raspberry tastiness. Love this pastry and have to restrain myself from getting it more regularly because I am only 2 blocks away. Try it, you won't be sorry."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2015-10-20,5,Decided to try their croissant after reading the rave reviews online. They were pretty big in size with their signature red raspberry ribbons baked right in. First bite: ehhhh. It was just a plain croissant that was good but nothing super special. Then I decided to take another bite. This time I got a bite with the chocolate filling. Mind blown. It was soooo delicious! My only regret was that I had only bought one for the road... Can't wait to go back for more!
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2015-09-18,5,"After I red an article about their Chocolate-Raspberry Croissant, I was determined to have one. But once at the store, they told me that they were out of the raspberry croissant. I had the Kouign Amann instead. It was soft and delicate, made of buckwheat. Because it's light, I didn't have any heaviness on my stomach as desserts would usually make me feel."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2015-09-13,4,"Stopped here looking for lunch and they had a surprisingly decent selection. The half sandwich + soup for $10 is a pretty good deal. The soups of the day were tomato gazpacho (which was supposedly good) and the mushroom soup, which I was not a fan of. I was expecting a cream of mushroom soup but instead it was a strange thick and grainy consistency, like cream of wheat.

The only options for the 1/2 sandwich is the jambon beurre or the grilled cheese. The jambon beurre was delicious and the grilled cheese looked amazing as well. 

We also tried a selection of cheeses - they are incredibly strong cheeses, so be prepared!

All in all, it was a good place to stop for cheap lunch and the service was nice. I'm not a fan of the soup or cheeses, but the sandwiches were amazing"
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2015-06-13,4,"There are several things I like about the Plaza's visually appealing and gastronomically-pleasing atrium: 1) clean restrooms, 2) beautifully crafted pastries as eye candy if you're on a diet, and 3) quick service joints.

1) Need to run from UES to Grand Central for lunch but have to pee?  Plaza.

2) Candy.  Cookies.  Cupcakes.  Macarons.  It's like a rainbow for your eyes (and stomach) to digest.

3) Want to grab a quick bite for breakfast, or an iced coffee for New York's muggy hot summer days?  Epicerie Boulud is one fab option for that.  Plus, if you come here on a weekday morning, the atrium will be mostly empty, and you can grab a table and eat your food in peace."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2015-04-26,3,The gelato was pretty good. Tho some of the ice cream is pre-scooped. And then it kinda changes color and looks different from the fresh stuff in the rest of the pan. The gelato was very tasty tho. The lemon was tart and refreshing and the pistachio / cherry was good as well. Macaroons were delicious as well.
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2015-04-13,4,"This is a nice little eatery inside the Plaza Food Hall. The food comes fast and the place has sleek bar seating as well as high tables. Despite the french pedigree, I had a Epicerie Banh Mi sandwich, which involved thai sausage, country pate, parisian ham, daikon and carrot slaw, jalapeño and herb salad on a crispy roll. It was delicious, though I wish the insides had been warmed up like the bread was. Super good anyway!"
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2015-03-20,4,"When given the option of Peanut Butter, Vanilla or Raspberry I'm going to pick PB every single time. Today was no exception...even when 'peanut butter' comes in the form of a macaron.

If you find yourself wondering around the Plaza Food Hall and in need of something small, a little sweet, but not overly peanut buttery then stop by Epicerie Boulud for a Peanut Butter Macaron.  So yummy and ended up being one of my favorites from Macaron Day."
97,épicerie-boulud-new-york-7,2015-03-20,4,"There are duplicate reviews for their location across 59th between Columbus Circle & Lincoln Plaza, but none for their Plaza Food Hall presence -- https://www.epicerieboulud.com/plaza/ -- which sure is amply staffed and stocked. Average macaron for Macaron day, and a nice, expectedly pricey selection otherwise."

No one acknowledge me, even after finishing a previous transaction with another customer. At least 3 people behind the counter, all doing something else.  I ended up walking out. That's the first time that has happened to me in ANY Starbucks.  Need a little more training."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2020-01-02,4,"My Fav (with the Sweetest peeps! :) ), but I do wish they'd Fix the ruddy WiFi at this Starbucks!  Hasn't worked in Months now!! :/"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-10-04,4,"Great service, short lines and quick pick up...  can't ask for better.  The only issue I had, is that the Power Mats on the tables weren't working, I am sorry but when I think of going to Starbucks, I want a place to chill, drink coffee, borrow some wifi and charge your phone while you have a good cup of Java, Tea or Hot Cocoa... In my case I had a Pumpkin Spice Latte, It was delicious!! I also ordered a Chocolate Chip Cookie which I received nicely warmed....  Overall great experience!"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-08-22,5,Most efficient and organized Starbucks in the crazy Times Square area. Employees are so kind
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-07-26,3,"The atmosphere is loud and crazy, it took forever to get my drink even though there weren't that many people ahead of me, and don't get me wrong, I don't mind waiting but I think the wait was a little excessive. I had to literally SCREAM so the barista could take my order, and my drink ended up being wrong.. I wonder why lol. But other than that, it isn't the worst store I've been to but it's certainly far from the best."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-07-26,3,Music was painfully loud. It was extremely hard to order due to the music and I had to tell my order. The floor was a dirty mess but I mean it was packed so I can't just hate on that... but my drink was also made wrong so I have to bump it down the 3 stars. The staff seemed super nice though which was a plus! Lower the music though ^
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-07-01,1,They need a manager or someone who understands customer service.  Ignoring customers and dancing while people wait.  It's insulting to the customers.  Unprofessional for a Starbucks.
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-06-17,5,I love coming here . They are all so nice . Wes is my favorite barista always smiling and just a delight . He makes my day start off great
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-05-21,1,"I've only been to this Starbucks three times and they've messed up my order EVERY time. I guess the fact I kept going back is my own fault at this point. They 1st gave me my grande latte that was only filled half-way (?!!?!), then next visit I got whole milk when I ordered coconut milk (maybe lower the music in there) and this morning I ordered ham and cheese egg bites and they gave me a ham and cheese croissant. Won't come here again."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-05-17,1,"Inept staff. Music so loud you could not order. Orders were incomplete, food was soggy and old. Decor was under construction or repair. Abysmal."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-03-27,3,"[874]

This Starbucks location is located on 8th Ave.   

Minimal seating but that not shocking in New York City.

The line was long but my order was properly prepared.

I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-03-17,1,Don't go to this location. Employees are horrible. Got my order wrong twice and they never smiled. Go to the other Starbucks.
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-02-28,5,"I recently stayed at the Westin across the street for a business trip and went to this Starbucks every morning around 7-730. The staff was SO friendly and energetic! The girl manning the register (who's name I wish I had gotten) was honestly the sweetest Starbucks cashier I've ever had. Every morning when I'd come in she'd said great me with a big GOOD MORNING and ask ""what can I get for you baby?!"" I just loved her energy so much! And her team made the best vanilla latte every single day. I know Starbucks is supposed to always be consistent but the truth is they aren't. I'm always finding that I need to ask for more of this or that, and this one always made my vanilla latter to perfection. Plus the music was so good! Anyway, just wanted to let the weekday morning crew know they are doing a great job. I didn't have time to stop in before leaving and tell them myself, but hopefully they read this review :)"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-02-16,1,"Just back from the most superfluous Starbucks ever. Was served, after a wait (there was no line) by a dazed barista who was friendly without being particularly nice, and who didn't seem to know what he was doing. I asked for a tall dark roast and a  particular pastry but they were out, so I asked for a different baked good, they were out of that, too. I asked what they *weren't* out of and the barista disappeared for a moment while he looked only to come back offering three items I wasn't interested in. I then asked for only the tall dark roast and scanned my mobile app and he then told me they were out of that as well. ""You can have a Pike Place or a Blonde roast instead. ""Yeah, a Pike Place instead, please."" ""So that's a grande Pike Place?"" ""No, a tall."" Dazed barista then disappears for a minute and comes back. ""We're out of Pike Place. It'll be about 5 minutes. You want to wait?"" At this point I was flummoxed and couldn't muster up anything except, ""Really?"" At which point he gave ME an annoyed look. ""Never mind then,"" I offered. He asked me if I wanted to refund my app, at which point he expertly and confidently completed the transaction which leads me to believe he might do this more often than not.
For those of us familiar with this neighborhood, it's unspoken common knowledge that this is one of the worst managed coffee shops bearing the Starbucks brand, it's almost a joke. But I'm not laughing anymore. This place sucks."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2019-01-13,2,"7 visible employees in store, 6 customers, slow service. Lots of joking around the counter. The cashier was clearly not interested in being there. The only benefit is that it is not very crowded compared to the other starbucks."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2018-11-29,5,"This is my FAVORITE Starbucks in the city!!  The baristas are always pleasant and personable.  I usually order the same thing (hot chai latte), but last night the barista suggested adding a shot of vanilla and it was so good!!  I always stop in here on my way back to Port Authority.  I've been in other locations where they really don't care if you're there or not, and I've never felt like that here!  This is a busy location but I've never really had to wait long.  Perfect place to stop on your way to/from Port Authority or if you're heading to the theater district."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2018-08-16,2,"Stopped in for a break from the heat & to get a cool drink. I ordered a ultra caramel frap. & it was the saddest drink I have ever seen. The cup was not even full of the drink, and it was liquid-- hardly any ice. Overall very disappointing."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2018-08-06,2,"Bad service, bad drink, overall just bad store. There's a difference between busy store and just bad store. I've been to a plenty of busy, crowded stores that are way better than this.

1. Workers hate being here. 
I ordered Venti Iced Bean Latte at this store while waiting for someone. The cashier girl with piercings just absolutely hated being there. She eyerolled at customers and was frowning the whole time.

2. Drink is poorly made
My venti drink was not even close to be filled to top, although I didn't ask for a room. Also it was poorly made. It was all watery and bland. 

3. Does not follow the Starbucks policy
I stayed inside the store the entire time so I wanted a refill. I asked Iced Grean tea because according to the free refill policy, I can get a coffee or tea as a refill regardless of the original drink. The cashier refused to give me a refill. 

Second time, I showed her the website and customer service policy yet she kept refusing. 

Even the manager was not knowledgeable and refused to give me a refill, although I paid with my Gold card, stayed in the store the entire time, and showed them the policy page. I'm very dissatisfied with the service. 

4. No bathroom
The only bathroom there is only for employers.

2 stars because it at least has AC and is relatively fast...but I think they're fast because they give you a low-quality drink that doesnt fill the cup."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2018-08-01,3,"I ordered a simple Iced Black Coffee, no classic, light ice. I waited for a while until I realized my order was ready but my name was not called or incorrectly called? The drink presented wasn't even what I would have expected as it had milk in it when I specifically ordered it black. I asked for it to be corrected and the barista simply poured out the liquid and added more coffee. This would have been ok except, there was still milk in there and more ice was added... I didn't want to bother and just took it as is. My iced coffee was tinted with milk and watered down. This location is a very busy tourist area so avoid if possible."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2018-08-01,2,"Only choose this location if you have a TON of free time. Also, since it's a popular spot, they run out of many things early in the day."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2017-10-29,1,"What's going on? Slowest line I've ever witnessed in life and at a Starbucks.  Guy at counter can't move quick, process what's being said to him and it's a little strange.  Hope he's okay lol"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2017-07-11,3,"Not the most efficient Starbucks and not the most spacious, but then again it's in the throes of Times Square / Theater District area. Expect to wait in line regardless of what you get. I literally just went in to get a water/snack and was in there for about 10 mins. The staff tries its best to accommodate a smooth flow, but something is just not quite right. However the display case was well stocked and everything looked fresh."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2017-07-04,3,"Subpar location. In truth, this is a very very busy location and everyone seems to be working so I give them some credit but the wait is lengthy for a Starbucks. Also I seem to do quite a lot of walking them through their menu with my drink order (black iced tea, no water). I know that refills are a perk of Starbucks but my order is not something new or complicated. I would avoid this location and go to the 42/8 store around the corner. They seem to have it figured out over there."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2017-07-02,3,"Starbucks is located on the main level of port authority, great location so you can get your coffee fix before going on your long bus trip or for when you reach your destination of NY.  
They serve all the regular drinks from cold to hot for coffees, teas, sodas, juices, water and have some pastries and sandwiches to go. 
They have one line that goes pretty fast- and that's for placing your order- while paying they ask for your name, then you wait at the other end of the store for your name to be called and your order/drinks are done. 
There problem here- your waiting around 10 minutes after you paid for your order/name to be called.  If your not right up front waiting for your name to be called with everyone else, watch out- yesterday there were little kids with there parents and they were touching everyone's drinks while the workers were placing them down.
We ordered two Carmel Frappuccinos, topped with whipped cream. They were made to expectations and a good drink to bring onto our bus for our trip back home."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2017-02-22,2,"Servers were soooo slow, even without many people in line, and not very friendly. Won't be coming to this one again. Thankfully, there are other starbucks locations on every block."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2017-01-20,1,"Staff is friendly but so slow. They took over 15 mins to serve me 2 black iced coffees with 3 staff, and 2 customers ahead of me. Not to mention coffee was watered down. I've heard that this Starbucks is bad, but I didn't expect it to be this slow. They also have a bathroom but refuse to let customers to use it. I'll be reporting this via 311."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-12-20,1,"Has to be THE worst Starbucks in the system. I have never waited less than 10 minutes and the batistas here are not only slow, they're nasty. Dare to ask them about the status of your order after waiting 15 mins and incur their wrath! They consistently get orders wrong and somehow have a penchant for serving hot drinks cold. Now if you thought you caught attitude for asking about your order status, wait until you tell them you actually wanted your hot latte hot!!! I will only go here if I'm in a total rush but will usually go out of my water to go to the Starbucks 4 blocks south at 39th and 8th. Here they are friendly, fast and get the orders right the first time."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-10-01,1,"Taste like water, they don't put enough coffee on it. 
Don't Go. Also not enough cookies, not enough choice. No gloves ....
Just because it's Starbucks it doesn't me it's good..."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-09-24,1,"Do yourself a favor and walk three blocks north to Pret a Manger. 43rd & 8th used to be my go-to Starbucks location. I've kept going back in hopes of improvement but today was the last straw. Even when they're actually fully staffed (which is unusual- and ridiculous given that it is in one of the busiest neighborhoods in New York City), The service is so painfully slow that I have actually had to leave the last five times I've walked into the store. I may actually lose my gold status- and I kind of don't care. No amount of free food is worth dealing with this location."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-09-20,2,Chaotic. Slow. Not so friendly. Chip card requirement slows things down a lot.  Big confusing mosh pit of people waiting for their coffee.
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-08-26,1,"Worst Starbucks I have ever been to! Always dirty, never a seat and they ALWAYS seem to mess up my drink order. I don't order anything fancy - it could be a tall dark roast with room - and they will even screw that up! The one on 42nd (btwn 7th and 8th) - though I've only ordered from there once - is much better (at least they got my order right). The Starbucks in the NHL Store on 47th & 6th is my go to spot because it's right next door to my office. In other words, try any Starbucks but this one."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-08-10,1,"Awful Starbucks. Yesterday I walked 5 blocks farther to go to the one in Times Square -- I wish I had done the same today. Used mobile order (like I do every day -- Starbucks you killed it with this one!), and showed up a few minutes late (as in, 8 on an order that said it would be ready in 2-5), knowing this is a busy area.

Went to the pick up counter, and nada. Waited some more.. Still nada. The people behind the counter, meanwhile, were clearly overwhelmed, and I watched them mocking customers together when the customers got upset with repeated mistakes (""Sorry, we don't have 2% milk, so I just used skim, that's why it's light"") and general lateness. I also had a meeting to get to in 10 minutes and had already been waiting 10 minutes when I finally spoke up. The barista (baristo?) was pretty lost and had no idea where my order was. He went to the sticker printer and picked up a row of 6 or so orders that had gone unfilled in the past ten minutes, as if that would make me feel better.

A different barista asked me what I wanted, I said an iced skinny vanilla latte (thinking she would go look for my sticker with the rest of the details), but apparently she did not, as the latte I got was missing the additional shot of espresso THAT I ALREADY PAID FOR and had too much syrup. When I questioned my spinach fold over they had somehow made that part of the order (?!?) and it had been sitting there for the last 12 minutes and was now lukewarm. 

As more customers got upset, the baristonians tried to defend themselves saying they get lots of mobile orders at once, they don't know who comes first - in person or on mobile - and they get really busy. Sorry, baristdudes, not my problem and frankly, that's your job."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-07-20,1,"I order the frappucino thru the mobile app.
I went to the store ask for pick up frist time fat black lady she ignore me. Second time she ask my name(she just realize that I'm exist) after she ask my name there is no respond or anything from her and I been waiting patiently more than 20 minute then I ask for the third time finally she handed me a completely melted frappucino. (It does not look like it's edible ) never gonna go back there again."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-06-09,1,Truly the worst starbucks.  It isn't even busy and it takes them 11 mins to make a flat white????  Lazy rude staff.
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-06-05,1,"Laughably bad. It's got that get'em in then get'em out vibe. No plugs to charge, few seats, poor service. Avoid unless you need it for points."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-05-20,1,"Bad service! I order venti, but she did the tall size. Without apologized for the mistake, she was also pungent on the costumers!"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-04-01,2,"And just like that - the great manager they had here is gone and the place goes to hell. There are a few friendly faces at the register, but drinks are slowly and poorly made. 

I can't keep coming here..."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-03-29,1,"I usually like Starbucks, quick friendly service and people who are on point.

This location is awful, one cashier with huge lines, filthy tables, no milk or cream available at self service stands. Extremely rude employees engaged in personal conversation making the line move even slower and practically ignoring the customers.

I won't be back to this or any other location after experiencing this."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2016-03-23,1,"It's kind of fun giving a Starbucks a bad review, because I know it's like trying to scar the ocean with a teaspoon of milk. I can only surmise that this review might translate poorly upon the employees, so I'd like to stress that the cashier, ""Tiny?"" She was very warm and welcoming and doing her best. This place is nuzzled against Times Square; it's super populated and it's dirty inside (joke about my ex wife). As far as I can see the people working here are working their butts off, it's just not enough for the crowd. 

I've been waiting here for a long while now. It's been so long I honestly can't remember a life before Starbucks. I have to assume the worst... I'll probably die here. So by the time I get my venti iced coffee, I'll need to find a suitable mate and repopulate as best I can, start a home here... Maybe grow a farm from the seeds I find in the garbage.

Anyway, so my official review is that unless you want to die a slow death, you should just go to one of the many other awesome coffee joints in Hell's Kitchen. 

Don't be like me. Stay in school!"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-12-11,2,"One of the slowest locations in the city.  Huge lines (Times Square, no surprise) and always very few folks behind the counter making things happen.  They're giving it their best shot under the circumstances, but don't expect to get in and out of here in any kind of hurry no matter the time of day."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-11-15,1,"Probably the worst Starbucks ever. Basic drinks made incorrectly. Workers are rude, talk about customers right in front of other customers. So many people working but seems like no one wants to help. I asked for a drink tray, and the girl just says, ""No. No trays."" So rude. Pissed I just spent $17 worth of drinks and they all suck."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-11-01,1,"Worst Starbucks ever. I live in Seattle so my Starbucks bar is high but this has to be the worst I've ever been too. Way too many working and literally doing nothing. I had to wait 14 minutes for my grande! Advice to management- tighten up ship asap. Staff is rude and disrespectful and there's zero sense of urgency. Staff acts as though we are on their time and can just sit around and wait for coffee to be served when they please; no, not ok. Firing and hiring needs to happen"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-10-21,4,"Small location. If you're hoping to sit down & do some work while you're here, chances are you won't be able to. 

Staff is very friendly and efficient. They're excellent at getting your order & getting you out the door, but not in a ""we don't want you here"" kinda way. They understand that people in the city are busy & they don't want to take up any of your time if you don't want them to. 

When I was there they were out of bags which meant I had to carry the souvenir cup I got for my wife in my hand, but whatever. No biggie."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-10-14,1,"I came here about a week ago, wanted a frappuccino. Machine was broken, no fraps. Ok.

Came back today, same exact story. Get your shit together Starbucks."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-09-29,4,"I stopped by here for a PSL before having to attending a conference one early morning. 

There was only one person ringing people up but that was because 2 were making the drinks. 

They got my name right and my drink right, which is all one can ask for! I didn't have to wait forever for mine either. 

Also, found a seat pretty easily to rest and wait until I had to be where I had to go. So always a nice perk. 

Not a bad spot."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-09-25,1,One of the slowest starbucks in Manhattan.  Also this location refused to accept my free drink rewards.  The management was not nice about it.
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-08-10,1,"Rude customer service, very rude cashier. The barista was no better. He made the wrong drink, and didn't even know where they kept the ice. Seriously...a barista that doesn't know where to get ice...My order was a green tea latte, he made a grande latte...clearly he didn't pay much attention during his training (if he ever had one). Afterwards, he process to make the correct drink, which is a green tea latte. Well, what do you know, he just pour milk and dump some matcha powder and handed to me. Speechless.....I think he expected me to shake it on my own...excellent attitude! Way to go!"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-08-05,1,"A pretty tragic Starbucks right in Times Square. Extremely slow, even though there are always five staff members there and at least two making drinks. There is always a huge group waiting for drinks, at least 5-10 people and today a group of 10+. Poor tourists. Go to the one on 42nd between 7th and 8th, much faster service and more sitting room too."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-08-02,5,"I haven't met many friendly Starbucks workers in New York yet, but Karolyn got me an iced, cold water when I was dehydrated and stopped by for some cool air. So she basically saved my life. Thanks, Karolyn!"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-07-03,2,The service here sucks. The baristas here a very rude and disrespectful to the customers. They chose to speak about us right in front of our faces instead of addressing it privately or just simply having better service where the customer wouldn't have to complain
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-07-03,2,"For being so centrally located in a fast-paced area, this is one of the slowest Starbucks in NYC."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-06-29,3,"I've been visiting this Starbucks at least 3 times a week on my way to Penn Station and it's a basic Starbucks. 

While there is nothing special about the place or the staff it's the same quality coffee you would get at any other Starbucks. 

The one good thing about this location is its always clean."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-06-07,1,"Very slow despite lots of people working. With so many around, avoid this one. 4 people working behind bar, but they all seem to be bumping heads and nothing else."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-04-29,1,"Horrible customer service! I told the cashier my order,  she wrote it correctly on the sticker. The person making the drinks made it wrong,  and then proceeded to give me attitude when I questioned it.  I asked for 'nonfat', she made it 'no foam' with whole milk, and said 'that's what it said'. Look at the picture and tell me if it says 'no foam'."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-04-01,1,"What do you call an espresso that makes you sad? A depresso! 

Meh I exprencied better ....

 My top bad experiences at this Starbucks are: 

- getting a Latte made with whipping cream instead of chai! 
- watery iced tea! 
- too much ice in the iced tea! 
-crowded! Always crowed...
***The worst part about this place is there is no outlets at all and very limited to seatings!"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-02-23,3,"I get it- it's a busy area and things can seem hectic. If it wasn't for the smile the barista forced at the end of our transaction, I would have given this place 1 star for the following: 
Code required for the bathroom; they didn't even tell me they inconvenienced another barista to go open it for me. Which... FINE but its not like I'm going to post the code on yelp for all to see. He was rude about it anyway.
No comfortable seating- a few stubby stools, no chairs."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2015-02-20,1,This is by far the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. I have always felt that Starbucks has prided themselves in excellent customer service. This one has no pride in anything. The workers are rude and seem miserable to be working there. I came here 2 days in a row while at work and it's just horrible. I give it 1 star because I have to put in something if not I would have put zero.....
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2014-08-30,1,"Very crowded this morning, and had a new staff working who was clueless, took a long time for other staff to realize they needed to help out. my turkey bacon was barely cooked and cold, and the new clueless one made my iced Oprah chai with nearly no syrup, then argued with me when I showed her. I nearly missed my bus though I had been 25 min early, and had to blow the cash because I couldn't wait for another chai. terrible."

No seating to speak of - but you're in times square - who wants to sit ??? only issue: they make the drinks out of order... so if you have a group of 3 or 4 ... you may have to wait a while for people behind you getting theirs first.

Forget this place ASAP!"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2014-07-01,2,"Not the worst Starbucks I've ever been too but nothing to rave about either. Service was speedy, but seeing as the face of the building was being renovated, it looked like the place was closed. Ordered two iced waters and used the washrooms here. The orders took less than 5 minutes. But the washroom took 10 or more minute and was only waiting for 2 people. The first lady took forever in there and while waiting, I was wondering if she was giving birth; for heaven sake! The only pro about this place was that it was on the way to Penn Station. Other than that, you'll find better elsewhere! Stay clear if possible."

During my stay in NYC I came in twice in the morning and the place was pretty packed, but the line moved at a good pace.  There is no seating area in this starbucks, FYI."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2014-03-03,5,"I don't drink coffee, but the tea is very good. Quick service. Friendly staff.  Clean place"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2014-01-06,3,I've forgotten which starbucks this is. They're all pretty interchangeable
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2013-08-05,2,"Oy. Not nearly enough seating for a midtown Starbucks. The line moved quickly, but my drink took forever (And it was a black tea lemonade! No brewing required). There was a crowd around the ""waiting area,"" but that's because a couple of boxes & an open cabinet revealed a restocking disaster that had spread onto the floor. Messy & crowded. My drink was good, and that is its saving grace. But overall? Not impressed. Try again, midtown Starbucks!

PS: Also the door is way too heavy. I know I'm little, but I saw more than a few people (women & men alike) who struggled to open the door. Doesn't really affect my opinion of the business, but just be careful when you're trying to leave with the drink in your hand!"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2013-06-27,2,"Between all of the ice and the foam on top I some how feel ripped off. On top of the fact that cashiers at The Bucks is always borderline slow. I ordered a peach green tea lemonade. While it was extremely tasty, it's such a hassle. I don't mind paying $4 for a grande drink that I enjoy but I DO mind paying $4 for a grande drink, sans ice, that can be poured in a tall cup. Using ice as a filler. A buttload of it at that. Ps my name is not Amika ???"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2013-05-25,4,"I hate everything in Time Square, but it was very nice to walk out of the movie theatre on a rainy day and get a hot cup of coffee!"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2013-05-09,5,Defiantly a great atmosphere and nice seating with exceptionality in speed if service and quality! Loved it!
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2013-05-06,4,"I usually don't want to review chain places but this Starbucks went above and beyond. 

The customer service I received was awesome. They were very friendly and super quick.

They have a a great set up when it comes to the line and make sure to ask for your name so they know who the coffee is for in the end. 

It's not quite as big as most other Starbucks, but it gets the job done. 

If I was on that side of town and needed a quick fix of java - I would definitely stop again."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2013-04-10,1,"Initially was going to give the highest rating I anticipated giving any Starbucks....ever. The etiquette of the staff (only Starbucks I've been to where employees address customers as ""sir"" and ""ma'am"") is offset by how busy and crowded this place is, unfortunately. What really made me drop this review was the barista making drinks. 1. Doesn't call out the orders or names on the orders when they're completed.
2. Openly flirted with customer in front of all the customers."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2013-03-29,4,Typical Starbucks. Service was good. Food/drink was good.
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2013-03-06,5,"With Starbucks is the promise of free wi-Fi, an opportunity to get work done and outlets to charge your phone. That's a win across the board.

Although its crowded and when it should be crazy, there are no loud obnoxious patrons. Def great place to work.. you would almost forget you were in Times Square.  

And as always love the music selection."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2013-02-09,4,"On a cold day in NYC, Starbucks is the place to go. Very fast service! Super friendly staff! The best part is very good coffee!!!"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2012-10-17,5,"This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations. In terms of the drink and food, it's precisely the same as any other Starbucks. But the staff here has a peppiness unrivaled in other Midtown Starbuckses. It's like they're feeding them drugs that make them immune to typical New York assholery; and in particularly strong doses, because this is Midtown we're talking."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2012-07-31,5,"Great Starbucks. Drinks are always great and the employees are cool (except the cornball David jk). This Starbucks actually have an exclusive drink called the ""Flopuccino"". Ask Deshawn to make it. If it's at night you might not see him though. He is a very dark individual lol jk.

Seriously this is a great Starbucks with great people."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2012-07-30,4,"Great Starbucks! Fast service, SUPER friendly and efficient staff, not much space to sit (but it's ok, I always took to go on my way to my old job). If it gets too busy, the staff will come get your order in line. As you can tell, they are very efficient.

Once again I dock a star because of all the tourists. Not the tourists or coffee shop's fault, but I like a Starbucks that is relatively tourist-free so that I can come in and out very quickly to or from work."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2012-06-14,1,"Coffee is good, but any of the other Starbucks within a couple blocks have a better staff. I placed my order (no orders in front of mine), and it was 10 minutes before they decided to start making it.  Take a stand on poor service and take your business elsewhere.  The one @ 750 7th Avenue has Baristas that are friendly and efficient"
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2012-02-22,5,Fast and friendly service and the now have reserve coffee's that they grind and brew fresh for you. I may never go back to Dunkin again.
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2011-07-06,5,"What can I say, a lot of people know what to get when it comes to starbucks, good coffee, good customer service. 

However, just because of the customer service, this is the only one I really choose to go to. Not only are the employees, like David, incredible but they all make pretty kick ass drinks too, no matter what I'm feeling like they satisfy. 

A+."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2011-01-20,4,"If you're looking for a Starbucks in the area that's not crowded and you don't have to wait on line, this is the one. It's not a big Starbucks, but they always have a table or two available or you can sit by the window."
98,starbucks-new-york-162,2011-01-11,2,"I received about $40 in Starbucks giftcards from well-meaning relatives and coworkers over the holidays. 

I've been eating these $5.35 egg salad sandwiches and $4.95 snack plates for the past week for lunch. Really, it isn't that good, I'm left hungry, and you can get a bigger and better egg salad sandwich for less at any diner or deli.

To add insult to injury (to cliches?), this location doesn't even have much seating. And the coffee tastes burnt."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2020-02-22,4,"Friendly staffs, reasonable prices, pretty fast and quite a few selections of milk tea and fruit tea. Small place so good for only to go but it's fine. Walkable to subway stations and easy to find. Coco is still a bit too sweet and the ingredients are fine but nothing to memorable. Nice for occasional cravings"
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-12-13,5,"My go to boba place. Pretty small and you can only stand by the table and have a sip, but for me it's okay. I know they're a chain offer standard menu but they got all the combinations I need (primarily classic milk tea with pudding and passion fruit green tea with aloe jelly). I didn't have bad service experience as mentioned by other comments, they are good."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-11-25,4,"Came here after dinner.  We're from San Francisco so wanted to try New York boba.  I wanted my 3 guy tea - black milk tea with boba, grass jelly hot and 30% sweet.  They didn't make it super hot, more like warm but I understand why, not to melt the grass jelly.  Could have made it a little warmer though.  The grass jelly was smooth and boba just right, a lint chewy with some sweetness.  30% sugar was plenty sweet and can still taste the tea.  The girl and guy at the store were friendly and courteous. The place was clean.  Surprise at the lower star rating from others.  Overall, better than a lot of boba tea places in the Bay Area."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-11-03,4,Pretty average bubble tea. I got the standard black tea with bubbles and non dairy milk. They also have paper straws instead of the usual plastic ones so if you're concerned about plastic waste you can throw away your plastic drink container with one less plastic straw. Like all paper straws they tend to get soggy after 30 minutes or so and they're also rigid. I'll probably will go plastic next time.
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-09-30,1,"Service:1/5 Taste:2/5
The staff who shakes the Boba undermined me ""Do you even know how to do math"" when the itemized receipt showed different amount than the price printed on menu Although the accounting practice was nothing major, however, that particular employee of Coco, who calls himself ""Daddy"" when I asked what his name was, not only condescended a customer but have also invited me to go outside and have a brawl, with acknowledgement of I just had a right shoulder surgery.  What a disrespectful person and unprofessional employee of Coco. 
The taste of the boba was terrible. The tea blend was indifferent than water, perhaps a tea bag could be more flavorful than theirs. I was unspeakably unsatisfied, and will NEVER go to this Boba shop ever, especially when I could have a cup of adequate boba and a nice chat else where, oh and not to mention also without an invitation to brawl. Reckless...."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-09-08,5,"Not really sure what the main complaint is for getting the rating it has right now, but it's bubble tea and it's not much different at all from other locations and other companies that serve the same stuff.   Choose a flavor, add ins, sugar amount and ice amount... pretty standard across the table.   Yes, it's more of a place to take and go, but it's another bubble tea joint that I enjoyed and was hesitant on lackluster reviews."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-07-22,3,"This is your average CoCo. This location is a tad smaller than the others, but still run by young people that churn out quick service. Nothing too spectacular to write about this. A recommendation: it would be helpful to have somewhere that they use non lactose milk. Surprisingly, that upsets my stomach more than regular milk, although, I'm not lactose intolerant."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-07-15,3,"I love bubble tea and usually come here a lot to get something. However, there's something that didn't please me which is one of the employee. Everyone is nice but one of the employee was rude. As today, I order my drink and he did something wrong, I just stick with it, what so ever. But I was a bit upset on how he deals with his co worker because apparently, she was new and ask for help. Then I saw the scenario that he scolded and harassed this poor girl right in front of me which I don't normally see here but this was the first time. He got my drinks wrong and was being mean to the new staff which literally caught my attention. People deserve respect in many ways which includes customers and employees. I still give 3 stars because the drink taste good but what needs to be work on is customer service and treating employees with core values and respect."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-07-07,5,"My go-to for boba. There's another boba tea closer to my place, but I prefer this one by a long shot. CoCo is a big chain and their boba is consistent across the board. The tapioca pearls are always perfect and they have a ton of different flavors. I usually get the Bubble Gaga (passionfruit tea with tapioca and coconut jelly). Perfect for a summer day, and they also have hot drinks in the winter."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-06-16,4,"Pretty good bubble milk tea - 30% sugar is just enough. There is NO seating inside, so it is a grab-and-go boba venue."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-05-29,3,"This is a small take-out location, walk in directly to the counter to place your order of one of a few dozen drink options. Menu is directly overhead the ordering area. 
My usual go to is the bubble milk tea, I also like adding grass jelly instead of bubbles sometimes for a less carb-y option. Like many bubble tea places they give you options to reduce or remove sugar (though there will be some natural sugars from the milk tea), and reduce or remove ice (for cold drinks). 
The tapioca bubbles here are on the sweeter side, still bouncy/chewy in a good way, like little chewy jello marbles. If I had one recommendation it would to make them the slightest but less sweet, but otherwise a decent place to pick up a mid-afternoon pick-me-up drink."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-05-22,3,"I don't know why my friends dragged me here, but they did and it wasn't awful but it was also not that great. The place is very small. It's a stand-and-drink place. I got taro milk tea with boba, it was just okay I've had plenty of bubble teas way better than this"
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-05-02,2,"I went through a Coco phase when I first moved to New York, but now I just go because this one is the closest to my office. Recently, I've been trying to cut down on tapioca, so I've opted for the 2 Ladies as opposed to the 3 Guys I used to always get. However, today, I realized the guy charged me extra to REPLACE the tapioca with grass jelly, which has never happened to me before. If I had wanted to do that, I would have just gotten all three. At 50% sugar, the drinks are still too sweet, and sometimes, I can taste some sort of particles ... unclear if it's sugar or milk powder or what it is. Also, whenever we go (around lunchtime), they always seem to be out of something on the menu. Wish there were more places closer to me to go to."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-04-06,4,"I'm pretty partial to CoCo for my bubble tea, and I couldn't be happier that one opened right down the street from me. No offense, but I'm so glad I can go here instead of Vivi now. I go here multiple times a week with no shame, and I've settled on a rough rotation of a few drinks. Usually, I'll get the Bubble Gaga (no sugar needed in my opinion), but I'm also a fan of the 2 Ladies, Hoji Bubble Milk Tea, and the various lychee options. Recently, they've been trying out a new drink called the Lava Pearl Latte that I'm also a really big fan of, but they haven't committed to having batches all day (I'm guessing they're specially made boba)... hopefully this gets added to their permanent rotation.

Service is great, and you're usually in and out super fast. There's only one small counter for standing inside, as the entire place is not very big. I'll admit that CoCo isn't necessarily the absolute best bubble tea you could buy, but it's more than good enough for satisfying my regular bubble tea cravings."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-03-26,4,"I love this tea chain. Coco is definitely my favorite. 
However, I'm giving 4 stars because this tea store was very small... I really wished it was a bit bigger to handle the number of customers it had. 

Overall:
Good tea
No restrooms 
No chairs/tables, gotta drink standing up or order to go"
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-03-24,5,"Came in for a spur-of-the-moment bubble tea!   Ordered a green tea with mango, no sugar, with tapioca bubbles.  One of the best bubble teas I've ever had!    :)

Employees were very friendly and helpful, and made my tea very quickly."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-03-10,4,"Pretty standard bubble tea chain, although now that I've been going to Teazzi, all other boba places don't taste nearly as good to me now... Still like Coco better than Vivi though! I ordered milk tea with pudding with less sugar and less ice, and it tasted great. The sweetness was perfect for me. I wish that they had added more of the topping in; there wasn't much pudding and it didn't satisfy my craving. There's nowhere to sit but there is a small counter where you can stand and have your drink."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-03-03,1,They double charged my credit card and refused to refund me or assist me. They told me to take it to the bank and didn't bother calling me back despite the guarantee that they would call me back immediately. Check your bank statements.
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-02-03,1,"I went on a very quiet Sunday night, there was no customers there, but the young man at the front desk emerged from the bottom of the counter looking very bored and annoyed at my arrival.  His greeting was lackluster and when I asked for a drink they don't have, he doesn't even suggest substitutes.  I asked for a jasmine green bubble tea and he did't even clarify if it's jasmine green tea or jasmine green milk tea.  He gave me a jasmine green MILK tea which I didn't want but didn't want to spend more time there to ask for a new one.  

HORRIBLE customer service and subpar tea and boba."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-01-20,1,"I am pretty convinced that this place is a rip-off and it is not one of the official Coco store originated from Taiwan. It is not on the store locator on Coco official website, you can check it by your own, it's en.coco-tea.com. The bubble is so tough, and it tastes so weird. They must have ripped off the Coco recipe and I can taste that. Avoid this place, and go to the Flushing location."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2019-01-09,3,"It's okay, nothing better than okay.

The bubble is kind of hard... hot milk tea is lukewarm.

Hoji Milk Tea tastes good!"
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2018-12-14,5,"Love this location! They play awesome J Pop , and the staff are all very nice. This location is more of a pick up and go than stay and hang with friends, which is perfect because I live 2 blocks away!
So we always end up going to my place after."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2018-11-17,4,"Came here for the grand opening which was BOGO. It's the same classic Coco taste, even from LA so I admire their consistency. However, the boba was a bit denser and not as chewy as I expected and they don't have a rewards card set up at this location. All in all though, happy there's more boba variety in Hell's Kitchen!"
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2018-11-01,4,"They had their grand opening here a couple of weeks ago and my friend and I went for their opening BOGO free deal. 

The interior is clean and looks just like any other CoCo in NYC except it's much much smaller. There's no seating/tables except for the ledge against the window. Overall pretty standard bubble tea chain with the standard menu and customization options. If you want something to grab and go, then this is a good location. If you're looking for somewhere to hang out with friends over bubble tea or maybe get some work done, then their Midtown East location or the one by Broadway and 38th might be a better choice for you."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2018-10-20,4,"Grand opening has BOGO from 10/19-10/21. Mango Green Tea, Taro Milk Tea, Bubble Tea, Jasmine Milk Tea, and Passion Fruit Green Tea."
99,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-24,2018-10-19,4,"So happy to have one in Hell's kitchen, it's like every other Coco, the owner was pretty nice in letting me customize my drink. There's a B1G1 free deal for this weekend."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2020-03-10,1,For what they charge for a salad Putting an avocado in it that is not right is unacceptable. The Rye location should get rid of their kitchen staff
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2020-02-22,2,I want to.give this place high marks. They offer a nice variety of plant based options and it's tasty but it is HIGHLY overpriced. OVER $16 FOR A LENTIL SALAD. Save you're money and go somewhereore reasonable.
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2020-02-16,5,"This is my favorite restaurant and has been for years! I got the Winter Porridge and a matcha latte, and both were incredible!! Y'all that winter porridge slaps. Buckwheat?? With seeds and idk what delectable crunch things?? And shredded carrots?? And an apple jam/compote topping?? And the coconut yogurt??? Wow. Amazing. I loved every bite, and I would say the coconut yogurt was the best part! I was surprised because usually coconut yogurt has a weird flavor or texture, but not at LPQ! 

Another reason to live and die for LPQ: you can get oat milk free of charge! Got some in my matcha latte and it frothed beautifully. The latte was so good--not really sweetened, but if you're into really strong matcha you may be disappointed. But for me it was perfect! 

I love the vibes here. Classical music and surrounded by rustic wooden shelves and that gorgeous bakery case--yes LPQ, take me to the elegant French countryside!!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2020-01-13,1,"Almond croissant had absolutely no almond inside. I truly don't mind paying 4.85 (yes outrageous) for a croissant but i do expect that the cost reflects the ingredients. In this case i basically overpaid for a plain croissant with some almonds on top. 

Brownie was 2/5 and lack of organized line and only 1 employee actually working are reasons i will not return."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-12-16,4,"This is our ""go to"" breakfast spot in NYC as we usually stay on Central Park south.  (7th Ave and 58th locational). Love the European atmosphere and consistency in food. Avocado toast is a favorite with an organize egg over easy...mmm. Frittata special is usually a good choice and the Coffee Mocha is a staple for us....Large of course!! And don't forget the Hazelnut spread - a treat I keep for special places. Today it started snowing outside along the bustling street as we enjoyed our brunch time breakfast. Love NYC at Christmas time!!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-12-15,4,"I don't usually frequent chains, but if you're looking for a place to sit and grab a coffee in this part of town, Le Pain Quotidian is a solid option. 

I came with a friend who is vegan and they have a few new options that are different and interesting. (She stuck with avocado toast, which, you know, is the reason we're broke, but hey, at least they add chia seeds.) I had the salmon plate, with a nice, fresh ricotta, a soft boiled egg, capers, and a generous serving of rye bread. It was tasty. I wish the coffee was a bit stronger.

And even though we were seated right next to another table, it didn't feel cramped and I couldn't hear their conversation.

The service can't be beat. We ate and lingered over coffee and our water glasses continued to be refilled. We weren't made to feel rushed at all, which was appreciated. And they run your credit card table side, so you can also clear out quickly if you need to.

The only funny thing was the continual, enormous line for the gender neutral restrooms. And they were so huge, they surely could've fit at least one more!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-12-03,2,"This place seems to be always busy with customers, so we decided to pick up some pastry for breakfast instead of ordering the room service from our hotel.

100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-09-12,1,"My husband and I went here last week for breakfast for the first time. We usually go to 9Ten but thought we should try something different, hoping it would be as good as Europa. What a laugh!

When we entered the restaurant it was not busy but there was no one to seat us. Finally a waiter motioned for us to come back to the back of the restaurant. It was a 2-top in the window. It was okay but I asked if we could have the first 2-top instead of the one at the end. He said they were saving that one to push together for a 4-top. That would have been fine with us except for the fact that their was hardly anyone eating there!

The waiter seated us with no menu, no water, no utensils, and no offer of coffee or anything. He didn't say that he wasn't our waiter so we kept waiting for him to come back but he never did. After nearly 15 minutes another waiter came over and handed us a menu but still no utensils, offer of coffee, water, or anything else! He went over and started cleaning silverware and setting a table - for no one. 

I am not making this up. The restaurant wasn't even a quarter full but there was absolutely no service! I saw other people trying to pay and get some attention but the waiters didn't even look at them. One guy needed a straw and he finally got up and got it himself.

We decided to wait 2 more minutes (generous!) and if no on came we were leaving.

Seven minutes later we were sitting in 9Ten; we immediately had water, a menu, coffee and tea, and 2 fresh squeezed OJ's! We were eating within 10 minutes. What a joy!

I don't know how long this restaurant has been here but I suspect it will not last long. Tourists might be fooled once but locals won't put up with this level of service. My husband grew up in Manhattan and we go up to see family several times a year. La Parisienne was our go-to diner and we were sad to see it go, but we will stick with 9Ten because we know what to expect. The food is always good and the service is excellent."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-06-20,1,"I had high hopes for this place. Perfect location across from Central Park. However, my matcha latte (w/ almond milk) was HORRIBLE. They put wayyyy too much matcha powder and barely any milk. There was a large amount of matcha powder sedimented to the bottom of the drink. I mixed up the drink thoroughly but it just made it worse since there was too much matcha. I paid ~$6.50 for a drink I ended up throwing away"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-06-18,5,I love this location - it's so conveniently located to Central Park and the nearby hotels! The breakfast sandwich is delicious and the coffee is hot and fresh. Service was fast and attentive. MD and Kazi are the best!

Had to go back in to ask them what they charged me for! Be wary, ask for receipt all the time!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-04-30,1,I have been to several of these Le Pain Quotidien because I used to be able to get a good organic coffee wherever I was in different neighborhoods but lately the coffee is like scalding dishwater. The service is terrible. I see Le Pain now as just a dismal experience rather than the cute place it used to be with smart service and quality goods. I wanted to purchase a bag of their coffee the other day at Lexington Avenue and 64th St and the bags were dusty and the dates on the bags expired. I will never go to another Le Pain again.
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-04-30,5,"An excellent bread and something. Everything is of great quality. If you want to drink a coffee and take some bread, this is perfect place. I will definitely come here again (even though there are queues)."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-03-29,4,"Here's the deal, the food is great. The service is dismal, if it were any worse it would be FRENCH. My  dorm cafeteria at Purdue University had better service."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-03-28,4,"Busy but large LPQ in a convenient location, close to Central Park. On a recent breakfast, food was delicious, fresh and flavorful. The bread was soft and the spreads are always good. The soft-boiled eggs are a go-to there and they were cooked very well. Coffee was strong and smelled good. The pastry case looked really appetizing as well. Great option for a quick hot drink, a treat or a full breakfast."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-03-23,4,Ordered an iced latte for pick up via ritual and my mind was blown. I don't use coffee for the stimulant effect but rather for the taste. I loved the perfect amount of bitterness from the beans they used. Their milk ratio was also on point. I did not need to add anything to it and I enjoyed sipping it throughout the day.
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-03-20,1,"We stayed the weekend in the city not too long ago and had an excellent time checking our some sights and restaurants. On our last day in town, we woke up pretty early and decided to go look for some breakfast. We didn't have that many choices available to us, but Le Pain Quotidien was open, so we decided to give it a shot

Uff, what a disaster.  The place was absolutely packed and the noise level was migraine inducing. Does anyone really like sitting in a raucous breakfast place? I certainly don't. First thing in the AM, I'm still trying to wake up and find some coffee. I have no desire to be surrounded by loud mouths going on and on about their previous nights adventure. Honestly, it's the worst. 

Aside from the noise level, service proved to be a disappointment as well. It took forever to get our food, several of the orders were wrong, and the dopey waiter hit my kid in the head with one of the plates. We got an apology but...what the hell? I've never seen a waiter hit anyone in the head with a plate. That was a first. 

Finally the food. The quality was somewhere between free hotel breakfast and shitty diner. Either way I was not impressed, especially at the price they charge. 

Not one of our best experiences and absolutely not recommended. Save the hassle and get something at Starbucks. It may not be gourmet, but it'll be quick and consistent."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-02-21,5,"This is by far my favorite LPQ. The staff, in particular Edward and Carlos the barista are wonderful! They always greet you with a smile, are patient and always prepare my coffee perfectly!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2019-02-16,1,Aweful service. Took 20 min to get any service. Took 45 min to pay. Won't be back. The staff just ignores you. Do not come here.
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-12-25,1,"Hot chocolate and the croissant were good. Now the service was terrible. Waitress forgot one hot chocolate, we asked her twice for it in a span of 15 minutes and nothing. Asked another waiter and he never brought it. Asked for a to go cup to two different waitress and never received it. Overall the worst service ever."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-12-25,1,"Worst experience ever. 20min to take order, then the order was taken wrong... super bad attention. And the order was only 3 hot chocolate one with almond milk..."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-12-25,1,Although enjoy this restaurant The service at this location was horrible. With a family member and waited 30 minutes for a simple egg sandwich that was supposed to come scrambled instead came over easy and runny and then they told me they don't do scrambled.Then the manager came and said course we do.I know it sounds silly but when you're on the trip traveling and there's more arrogance then customer service it becomes very disappointing.
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-12-12,5,"I was in NYC for the weekend & happened upon this place. It was Saturday morning & I enjoyed the atmosphere & the view out to the street. The service was attentive & prompt. I sat at the communal table & loved the experience. My breakfast was delicious, the mimosa was perfect & the coffee hit the spot. This was one of my favorite experiences the whole weekend! I will definitely be back."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-11-29,2,"So disappointed on a recent Sunday morning. We come here maybe once a year, and love the high-quality food and the ambience, especially the communal tables.

On this visit our waiter largely ignored us for much of our stay, never followed up to ask how everything was, or if we needed anything else. When he finally got around to giving us our check the pen was out of ink (which makes one wonder why we still bother with the whole signing the credit card receipt step in this day and age; can't this be done through our phones?). After trying, unsuccessfully, to gain his attention, and that of the hostess who made frequent laps around the restaurant (even the patron at the next table, seeing our plight, attempted to flag one of them down on our behalf), I went to the waitstaff portal to look for another pen but found only a red crayon, which didn't work so well. Ultimately, the hostess slammed a pen on our table when I finally managed to get her to stop.

For all the servers out there -- if all you do is take the order and deliver the food, please don't expect anything close to the ""suggested 18%"" tip."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-11-27,2,"The only reason why this place gets a two star instead of one is because of the nice manager. I went here with 2 friends and waited about 10 min to get seated. A party of 4 all Caucasian's gets seated right away and the waiter claims they were here before us. We knew for a fact we were here before and it was all a big misunderstanding. The waiter said it's a misunderstanding and we will prepare another seating arrangement however, we just wanted an apology. The waiter never apologized and we were then and there ready to just leave. The manager saw the whole incident and said that they will make it up to us by providing our order to be free. That was the only reason we ended up staying. We met a nice lady who had a service dog, and she was drinking wine and talking to us. Another waiter, who was serving her, said to her when she asked for another glass that ""this is your fifth"". How dare he keep count of how many she is drinking much less mention it. The food and manager is nice, but they need new waiters"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-11-09,4,Read the reviews and they didn't feel our server was fast and very friendly. Ordered a quiche lorraine and was just perfect. Most places tend to go over wit the ham but this was just perfect. I likked the setup too. Made me feel like I was back in Paris!
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-11-07,5,"I've been a LPQ patron for 10 years. I like their coffee, breads and spreads best. I regularly stop by this location after work to grab some bread and whatever pastry I'm craving. Normally I'm never asked anything. I get my doggy bag, I pay and I'm out the door....the NYC way. Tonight was very different. The manager Julia greeted me at the register with a friendly smile. She not only went in the back to grab my hazelnut flute because they were out of it in the front but she asked me if I would like it cut, if I wanted jam, if I needed anything else. She complimented my glasses and gave me a cup of water. She was so kind and warm, I felt compelled to say something to make it known that is kind of customer service is sooooo appreciated and so important. It's almost completely lost in the city but every now and then you run into someone like Julia and it makes your day a little bit better. LPQ has ginormous employee turnover but I do hope they find a way to keep and reward this wonderful manager. A real gem. Thank you, Julia."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-10-30,1,"The waffle was good, the service was so-so (had to ask for water twice, a refill, and received maple syrup a few minutes after receiving my waffles) , and the portions are 1/4 than what you would expect. Restroom is out of order and the other was occupied by someone for at least 30 minutes. I was forced to go to the out of order toilet after being desperate enough. Only the sink was out of order. I had to ask for my check after I don't how many minutes after my entire party's dishes were stacked, ready to be cleared."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-10-13,4,"Great place for breakfast just outside of Central Park.  the Warm Belgium Waffle with organic coffee was my choice, my wife had the breakfast sandwich both great ..."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-08-08,5,"This restaurant is amazing!! It's vegan friendly and has gluten free dishes and everything we had was excellent. In addition, the service was great."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-07-23,4,"I've been here around 7 times - and I always leave happy. The tartines are delicious - I always get the avocado tartine and add salmon & hard boiled egg. You won't be disappointed. 

In my experience, the service has always been very slow. I wouldn't recommend coming here before work or on lunch break. 

I have the app and it saves me so much time when ordering to-go, & I always get free rewards. Literally all the time! It's the best - if you're a regular the app is perfect for you!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-06-30,1,"Nice dining room, but extremely over priced for what  you get. My friend and I stopped in for a quick late breakfast and 50 dollars later we left still feeling hungry and what we ate gave both of us mild indigestion for the rest of the day..not recommended!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-06-23,3,"Unfortunately not my bowl of quinoa. Ordered the breakfast bowl and was disappointed, for that price at least they can put two eggs on the bed of quinoa and sweet potatoes. Maybe good for skinny vegans but if you want a hearty breakfast to get you through the day, look somewhere else."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-06-03,1,"What a shame.  On my way to work, after exiting the Q train, I often stop by Le Pain Quotidien for a large iced Americano.  Usually, I'm greeted by a fast moving line.  On Friday, June 1, at around 8 am, was greeted by the cashier's back as she wiped down a counter.  I waited patiently until another customer came in. Another additional cashier walked up and took her order.  I too placed my order, and was handed a cup with about a third of the coffee missing.  The other customer exited with a full cup.  I asked if they could please fill up my cup.  The two cashiers grabbed my coffee, snuck off to the side and filled my cup with coffee that was sitting on the counter when I arrived.  I asked if that was old coffee, and the reply was that it was the same.  Ewww.
I threw it out.  I wish I'd asked for a refund. 
I wish I'd gone to Starbucks.  At least they're now working on sensitivity training.  Even the coffee trucks on the corner appear friendlier.
I will never return."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-04-16,2,"I've been here a few times because of its convenient location. The service is consistently poor.
Sunday brunch party of 4. Two people ordered the baked frittata, kind of looked like a crustless quiche without the creamyness. They arrived tepid temperature. Since our waiter didn't check on us for 25 minutes, it was too late to send them back.
I ordered pad tai salad with zucchini spirals. Nice flavor but mostly arugula.
Egg skillet with avocado and onions was good.
We won't be returning for a while"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-03-31,5,"Quiche lorraine-5 stars
Great for lunch. Served piping hot. Delicious!

Open faced sandwich with fig and goat cheese
And
Crispy quinoa bowl."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-03-24,3,"not bad but a bit dirty
I got the lunch special with Quinoa, avocado toast and soup of the day: fairly cheap and tasty
my soy cappuccino was tasty but cold!
Its right outside from Central Park.
We try one more!"

100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-02-12,4,"2018 Review 9/100

I'm obsessed with this little cafe. I dined at Le Pain Quotidien once before in California and when I saw there was one just up the street from where I was staying in NYC I had to go.

I stopped in for an early lunch after a flight into town so I beat the lunch rush, which was nice. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Breakfast with a Cafe Au Lait with almond milk. Let's start with the coffee. I don't know what kind of coffee they use but that was one of the most delightful coffee beverages I've ever had. And I'm a regular coffee drinker. Then, onto the food. Super light and delicious. Everything paired so well together topped on the wheat toast.

So good. Great breakfast or lunch spot. I would come back for sure."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-01-16,5,I Like this location a lot - peopel are nice and service is fast.
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2018-01-04,4,"I always love this place, it's in the middle of Manhattan has a lots of  natural wood material interior decorations. My favorite is a ""Spiced hot apple cider with star anise""."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-12-25,1,"It's expensive here. I ordered 3 drinks and 2 pastries and it was $30. The chai tea was absolutely terrible. The worst I've ever had and I've had a chai at so many different cafes. Their blueberry muffin was also terrible. It was also hard as if it had been out for days. The service wasn't good either. Our waiter brought us our food but we didn't see him again until we wanted our check over 30 minutes later. There wasn't a lot of people either. For what we received, service and food/drinks, it's very over priced. I would not recommend going."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-12-11,1,"The place is just horrific!!! I've been buying coffee and having lunch at different levels pain location for a while, but never had such a terrible experience! The management is outrageous! We bought  coffee and tea and we're not allowed to take a seat at the community table!!! These people make money on tourists who just simple don't know the rules and willing to pay for nothing!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-12-09,5,Good enough for Helen Mirren good enough for us. Actually good was to die for waitress was great would come here everyday .
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-12-04,5,"Omg....the best organic latte I have ever had, not to strong but strong enough, I think when u r ordering large proportions are perfectly calculated, not sure though. ( ordered reg before and it was much weaker, may be proportion for reg size is slightly different)
I met my friend for a cup of coffee here or should I say for cup of coffee and cup of tea. We placed the order for our drinks and a second later they already screamed for pick up. That was super fast! Of course I didn't forget to  indulge myself with raspberry tart, how can I possible avoid dessert when it "" stares"" at you from  the moment you opened the door, especially when it's covered with healthy staff like raspberry. I ordered vanilla latte on almond milk and my friend ordered hot tea with honey lemon and ginger and organic coconut chia pudding, that  she claimed was heavenly delicious. Can't wait to get back for chocolate mousse cake, we have a ""date"" with it on Wednesday;)"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-11-28,4,"Very nice place for a healthy and rich breakfast - it is very crowded all morning, obviously loud and not cheap but the food is so good and the atmosphere is just what you would expect of a popular place in the city."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-11-19,5,"Having been to the Newport Beach location only once before, we still considered this a ""new"" experience. A half block out the back door of our hotel and we're chilly and hungry for breakfast/lunch/whatever. LPQ looks like a beckoning haven with big sunny windows, worn wooden tables and a decor that makes us feel like we've stepped into a Parisian bistro. Piles of heavenly smelling bakery and a friendly server both great us. We score a table for 2 in the window and now have a hard time choosing from the delicious variety on the menu. My husband has his priorities and today that's an apple turnover. He adds some steel cut Oatmeal with berries to ease his guilt about said turnover. I snitch a taste of that turnover. It's tasty. I'd return for just that some other time. I'm going for brunch and choose the kale salad with warm quinoa. It's loaded with all kinds of goodies: roasted sweet potatoes, nuts, goat cheese and other stuff that tastes good and makes me feel pretty good about my healthy food choice. The service is efficient and pretty good for a busy NYC restaurant. Tables are tight so it's not necessarily a romantic place but there's a je nais se quoi that makes it feel that way anyway. This location is super convenient to many of the hotels around Central Park South. So break away from room service or the hotel restaurant and feel like you're somewhere else for a little while."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-11-16,3,"Came here for a quick breakfast meeting with a friend and was disappointed. 

-Found 2 hairs in my food
-Eggs were impossible to peel since they were definitely not cooked long enough, even for a soft boiled egg (currently feeling a bit iffy TBH)
-The side of bacon (for $3+) is just two strips that they cut into tiny pieces so you don't notice how little bacon it actually is. 

The bread + latte is just about the only thing that keeps this review at nothing below 3 stars"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-09-20,5,"Great Le Pain Quotidien at 861 Lex.ave NYC, lots of space and comfort too, and of course great the food and snacks: and 148004 Fanta E. provided me with such excellent meal service there.  Thank U !John F."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-08-18,5,"Stopped in here for breakfast and ordered the skillet baked eggs with bacon and scallions. The service was exceptionally fast and accommodating. The coffee was exceptional as well.....if you are a coffee lover, this might be your new favorite coffee stop. This establishment offers not only  regular milk, but soy, almond and coconut milk! 
On the way out I spotted the pastries and bought a chocolate croissant for my afternoon guilty pleasure! The manager at the front was very helpful on choosing my selection, as there are so many to choose from! She also recommended the plum tart which is definitely my next purchase! 
If you are in this area, stop in and enjoy a delicious meal! I recommend this spot for your healthy or guilty culinary pleasures!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-08-15,5,"I have a heard a lot about this chain so I decided to stop in for a quick bite before going to Central Park. I ordered the avocado toast with salmon, and egg to top it off. I was also recommended to order the watermelon cooler which is a specialty drink that is supposedly only offered during the summer. Both were absolutely amazing and are now my new obsession! 

The ambiance here is very relaxing, and the service exceptional! I'll definitely be going back here to try some different dishes, and desserts!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-07-25,4,"Sit down restaurant with easy take out. I've been to a different location before so I wasn't expecting a bad experience. I go on for a late lunch so I can take it back to the office and had the whole menu to choose from. There wasn't a limited take out menu which was nice. I got the prosciutto, ricotta, and fig tartine and it cost me $15. The size of the portion was filling, but felt like it was slightly overpriced.

While waiting for my food to be prepared. I got to look around the baked goods. There are so many options! I have to go back and try some."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-06-04,4,Crapèz we're super delicious. We got there just before the morning rush and our order was made super fast. I wish they had more tables to sit and maybe more comfortable chairs but food was great.
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-04-19,4,Very good food!  Light breakfast items and very fast service!   The egg dish looked really good and all the breads were fresh.  The dipping sauces and dressing for the salad was really good too!
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-04-13,3,"Never been to one e of these but they apparently are popular in NYC. Fresh healthy sounding v food options. Had the salmon tortinni (sp?) and it was okay but a sliver of salmon on a thick piece of wheat bread like was not my idea of heaven. Perhaps the bread just didn't match what I was hoping for--a cool new way to enjoy the salmon it was not.

The best part of my visit was the company and the service. Nice comfortable place to hang out but I wouldn't choose to go there for the food."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-03-22,1,"Went to try the ""wonderful"" avocado toast but service was so HORRIBLE and slow that I left.

Visited today after a morning meeting en route to an afternoon meeting. After entering and waiting for a table I was waved over and pointed to sit at a table next to the cash register. 

After sitting for a few minutes and being completely ignored I asked for a menu. After having wait staff speak OVER me as they communicated with colleagues at the cash register I asked to be moved. ""Sure hun!"" was the response to the request. I saw myself to another table I waited to give my order ... and I waited.  I had to find a convenient time to flag down a waitress. I asked a few questions then asked for another minute to make up my mind. Big mistake! I was literally ignored (again) and after several attempts to flag down the same waitress. I placed my order and asked for water to take some pills before lunch. 

After considerable more time no water arrived. A tall waiter dutifully visited each table in my section and checked on EVERY guest except me. I waited, waited, no water. I noticed other tables filling up and customers being attended to without delay. I then stood put on my coat and headed to the door. The waitress saw me and didn't ask a question. I left after 20 minutes and before being able to try to the fabled avocado toast and without as much as a glass of water.  Service here is HORRIBLE. Management truly needs to intervene and train wait staff. 

I went around the corner to Pret A Manger and enjoyed a decent organic lunch at a fraction of the price of Le Pain Quotidian. Feel free to do the same if you're ever put off by the staff in this place. The way I was treated was ridiculous."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-03-18,5,Let me start by saying I've been here the last two weekends in a row so it's definitely a place worth going back to. The brunch menu is great as is the espresso. The food is overpriced and I would probably give the experience 4 stars overall for quality of food to price except that we had an awesome waiter that I would give 10/10. I think his name was Al and we actually sat in his section both weekends. He gave us some great ideas of what to do that afternoon in the area and I think he was the reason my girlfriend suggested we go back there the second time last weekend. Try and sit in his section when you go!
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-03-16,5,"I have been a customer in this place for many years now, and although the food isn't cheap, the quality is exceptional! I really enjoy coming in the mornings because the service is great and everyone who works here is happy all the time!
I would recommend the Salmon breakfast with a side of avocado. It's great protein for the morning and it's light. The coffee is also one of the best I've found in the city.
The customer service was great this morning! Julianna and Ony helped me throughout my meal, and made me feel right at home. 
Great team, exceptional food and the atmosphere is relaxing. If you're in the neighborhood you should definitely check this place out!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-03-13,5,"if you're in the area looking for a good spot to have a quick bite- have the soft boiled egg and a side of prociutto. Their quiches are pretty awesome too. 

Juliana is just the sweetest lady and is the only reason I come back time and time again. I work down the street and live few blocks away so I rly should be here like every day.

The the service is always inconsistent, apart from Juliana who's just a damn ray of sunshine, most people just seem to be overworked and under appreciated. Food is ok/good most of the time but the thing that gets me coming back is rly location...and did I mention Juliana? Lol"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-03-02,5,"Visiting from LA and thought I'd come to a familiar place! Same ambiance, great service, and I found some of my regular dishes on the menu. This Le Pain is in an amazing location if you're headed into Central Park. 
I had my usual which is the Salmon Breakfast, and a large latte. Never a disappointment, and to boost the servers were all having fun and were smiling while working at 7:30am! I'll definitely make this my go to place when coming to midtown."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-03-01,5,"Came here for a quick bite on a Sunday morning. I was recommended the frittata with a side of avocado, which I absolutely loved. I actually just thought I'd grab a quick croissant and coffee but my server Julianna adamantly advised me to try one of the specials! Good thing I did, because I was extremely satisfied. 
The coffee here is also quite good. I usually just stop at big chains here in the city to get my coffee, but it looks like I have a new place in which I can purchase from. My server gave me a list of all the Le Pain Quotidians in the city, so I can find one wherever I may be. This is perfect since I am from out of town and I travel all over the city for meetings. I'll now look forward to stopping by for lunch and, or dinner."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-02-28,5,"Stopped by Le Pain on 7th avenue today, and had a quick breakfast. I've been here a few times before, but today I had exceptional service. My server Julianna recommended their Super Green juice to get my day started, followed by the Salmon Breakfast with gluten free bread. I'm actually not gluten intolerant, but she highly recommended it, so I gave it a go. This bread is fantastic, and may be a weekly purchase from now on. 
If you are thinking of stopping by this place, I personally recommend their coffee as well. It's truly some of the best you will find in the city!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-01-31,2,"Came here for a quick bite in between meetings last week and while my chocolate croissant and coffee were satisfactory, service was lacking.

I knew what I wanted and told my server that a menu wasn't necessary and proceeded to ask him to bring me a coffee and chocolate croissant. He was gruff and dismissive with his hand gesture and grunt of a response. Not even sure he got my order but ok.

A few groups come in and his attitude was totally different. Cha-Ching. Gotcha. I know the deal. 

Short of flailing my arms, I finally get his attention and ask him to please warm my croissant. Same gruff response, but that's ok my coffee has arrived and all is good again. Shortly after, my barely warmed up croissant arrives and all is forgotten until I spill my coffee. My bad totally, but he sees all this go down and does not offer to help nor does he offer up more napkins as I'm mopping up the mess with the one napkin I had. Luckily there wasn't much coffee left and most of it was drenched up by my pants. Here's a tip, when you're pouring your coffee from the pot, hold the lid in place or risk wearing it like I did. 

Coffee as always, was good. Croissant was ok. Service, not so much. Treat ALL your customers well even if you know the bill won't amount to much. That's Service 101."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-01-14,4,"Absolutely loved the urban and organic vibe that it gave. The service was pretty good. All of the employees seemed to give off a positive aura. I had a simple cup of hot cocoa which I enjoyed. Wasn't too hot. However, i definitely need to go back to try the food."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-01-14,5,"This place is one of my favorite  locations I been too from their many locations. Staff are really friendly, in other words service is great. Very attentive and nice. My servant was Samira, she is a sweetheart.  Food was great I had the avocado toast with Boiled egg which was incredible. We also tried some of the spreads which our servant recommended. It was the Belgian hazelnut spreads, also cookie spread and the jam was delicious.  We also had the chocolate mouse was delicious, everything that I had was very good. I would definitely recommend this location and also its so close to Central Park.  I would definitely visit this site again =)"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-01-11,4,"Hard to resist the pain de chocolate as you come in the door. So I saved room for one as a sweet finish to brunch. I had the open face avocado spinach sandwich with an egg. You can only get a soft boiled egg here, they make no others. My friends had the chicken salad sandwich & the grain bowl. Both were large portions that could have been split. Fresh squeezed OJ and coffee were very good."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2017-01-11,5,"I absolutely love this place. I was just making my way into Central Park when I had found Le Pain Quotidian on 58th and 7th Ave. The food is fresh, delicious, and organic. The staff and management here had friendly smiles on their faces, and were extremely helpful. 
This was my first time at Le Pain so I needed a little help in choosing what to eat, since there are so many amazing choices
Thanks to my server Julianna, I believe I achieved the best option with the Avocado toast with added salmon and egg! Julianna also gave me multiple recommendations for my next visit, so I'll be back when I get back to the city! 
Excellent food! Excellent service! Excellent experience!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-12-04,3,"We stopped in breakfast on a Sunday. Service took forever.  and ever. coffee arrived at least 10-15 min after we ordered it and it was lukewarm. Food was good and I like the gluten free bread option  (very seeded and high quality). Smoked salmon was excellent. Everyone is crammed in like sardines, but that's New York for you. I don't think the food and coffee is good enough to overlook the terrible service."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-12-04,5,"Good foods, all organic fare, fast courteous service. The waiter made small talk and found we were tourists from Canada. And with the check he brought my son a croissant to go, compliments of the house, for our travels the rest of the day!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-11-27,5,"ordered double espresso, multi-grain raisins bread, Paris ham + cheese. about 17 bucks.

3 star to the multi-grain raisins bread. Crunchy bread crust. various seeds , raisins add a touch of sweetness. High in fiber n fulfilling too.

2 star to the espresso, I m loving it, unique depth.

** 
asked for mustard, love their mustard trio."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-11-02,5,"I thought we were in receipt of good cafes but I'll have to side with NY.  There is an amazing plethora of cafes everywhere and for those who are looking for a quick bite or a snack between meals, NY has it down.

Le Pain Quotidien is a charming little corner cafe/coffee shop and since we were in dire need of caffeine prior to hitting Central Park, this perk place was in perfect position in relation to where we were headed.  Staff here are efficient and service was quick with a smile.

I ordered the latte and a pumpkin muffin and greek yogurt with honey/pistachios.  All items were very good, especially the coffee.  It was so smooth!  The pumpkin muffin slightly dense but still moist and the yogurt?  I gobbled the entire thing down.  Remember to grab a few napkins before finding a seat behind the statue in Columbus Circle and watch the world walk by."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-10-21,5,"Visited this Le Pain Quotidien again a few days ago and was shocked.  Usually Le Pain serves wonderful food but the pace of their service can vary between good-ish and painfully slow. But this time my breakfast of a pair of soft boiled eggs and a caffe latte came out within 10 minutes - major kudos.

If you've never been here before there is a take out counter in front on the right and seating to the left and in the back. It can get packed at peak times but the tables usually move reasonably quickly. Lunch is served at breakfast time (much to the delight of my egg-allergic sweetie) and pretty much everything we've ever ordered has been delicious."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-10-09,4,"We ordered a basket of bread selection, thought large was too much for three. The pot of coffee was just a small pot not a generous pot to be shared amongst three. However it was good the pot was refillable. Service was good."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-10-03,3,"Food was good. They had good coffee. I ordered baked eggs with smoked salmon. Smoked salmon on my plate was scarce. I thought it was what it was  but as we were leaving the place, I saw the same dish on other tables and their plate was covered with smoked salmon. I wasn't the only one noticed. I think it should be all consistent."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-09-03,3,"Service was alright. Food was really good, I ordered the Belgian waffle, which was very good but definitely on the smaller side so don't order this if you're starving. The ham and gruyère cheese croissant was great, the avocado toast was alright..not much to it. It's a busy place so I'd reserve ahead. Great area around too, perfect for after eating walks around central park and 5th Ave. I'd go back to try out there pastries."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-08-14,5,"Wonderful French pastries coupled with whole good selections. You will find fresh squeezed juices, berry bowls, and avocado toast all for a reasonable price. The ambiance is lively but calmed with beautiful classical music is the background.  Nice find!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-08-01,3,"Grab a quick breakfast on our way to Central Park.  We got a fresh cold-press juice with some French croissant. All was good, clean place and ok service."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-07-15,4,"Healthy, light, nutritious food, if you are on a good choice; wooden interior decoration, casual setting"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-06-25,5,Lovely place. After seeing The Color Purple we were all in the mood to walk. After sometime we were ready to sit down and eat. I ordered the quiche that came with a garden salad. It was delicious. I skipped dessert because I am trying to not eat to much but believe you me they looked amazing. Staff was very nice. Bathroom were clean and there are two of them so that was helpful. After I enjoyed my food and the view out the large windows it was time to make our exit. All the staff said good bye. Warm and friendly.
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-06-24,4,"Pretty cute cafe that has some great healthy breakfast options.  I loved my ham and cheese croissant sandwich with a green side salad.  My mom came with me and ordered the avocado toast.  The waitress suggested that she add egg and smoked salmon to the toast which she did.  It was very tasty, super filling and a pretty large portion.  

Even though the food was good here, the service was a bit slow.  It took some time to get our menus and we also waited for a while for the waitress to take our order.  I would come back and give this place another time though."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-06-07,5,"We visited the Rockefeller Center location, but can't seem to find it on Yelp.  We had their ham and guyere cheese croissants, which were heavenly.  And the best belgian waffles with mixed berries and syrup ever!  The prices are a little high, but this is NY after all!  We enjoyed the outside seating and people watching ambience at the Rockefeller Center location.  We would definitely return for breakfast.  Hubby said the coffee was among the best he's tried!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-05-22,1,"I have been eating at Le Pain Quotidien for a number of years. Today was a terrible experience. Dirty tables, poorly cleaned silverware, porcelain coffee cups that were cracked....unpleasant manager who took over thirty minutes to come to the table when requested. 

The food was ok....I probably won't be back."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-04-17,4,Had a lovely Sunday breakfast. High quality ingredients. Wonderful organic banana muffin. Delicious yogurt with granola and berries. Great coffee. Peaceful ambience that makes you forget you're in the city. We will come back.
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-04-15,5,hands down best chai latte soup in NYC
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-03-31,3,Great service and ambience. The menu lacks depth and should have a better choice. The ingredients are all high quality but the menu doesn't do justice.
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-03-10,4,"Had brunch here and it was delicious! I had the waffle which came with fresh seasonal fruit. it was light, delicate, and filling at the same time. Very delicious and memorable dish. Marked a star down because there weren't many other options that appealed to me for brunch, also a bit on the expensive side for what you get."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-03-04,4,Good for a chain. Great healthy options. Will to continue to visit occasionally.  Great for gathering as a group or even as a light celebration.
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-02-23,5,"We have made this our regular breakfast place, the avocado sandwich is amazing. 
The atmosphere is fantastic!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-02-10,4,Their avocado toast and an americano are my favorite ways to start the day!
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-02-01,5,"Loved this place! Went here for a quick brunch and it was delicious. I got the waffle and a boiled egg and my husband got the avocado toast. The waffle was so good, kind of flaky like a pastry and so tasty with fruit and a little syrup on top. Avocado toast was amazing too! Service was polite and attentive. Definitely would go here again and recommend it to anyone."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-01-25,4,"Le Pain Quotidien was a good overall dining experience, with one flaw. I had their salmon breakfast and a tiny teapot of their green tea. $4.10 for a cup and a half of green tea seems excessive, but I was willing to pay $15 for the salmon. It was quite good. Their jams are divine, and their soft-boiled egg was a nice touch. This place would have deserved five stars but for the price. $20 for a conservatively-portioned lox breakfast? Plus tip/tax? Puh-lease!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-01-22,1,This was my go to while in NY - I have crossed this restaurant off my list after the dining experience today. Salty food. Incorrect order twice. Nice servers who are not adequately trained by management. Why not support and train your team?
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-01-16,4,"A good hangout place closer to Columbus Circle. Quality of the food was good as well. I am a dessert person, but I didn't find the Belgium chocolate brownie that I ordered any extraordinary. Being a student in the city, I found the price a little expensive for the quantity served."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2016-01-12,5,"The chilled bisque was perfectly refreshing on a summer day with just a hint of citrus. The toast with avocado, corn, and shrimp was simple but unbelievably good."
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2015-12-28,1,"Do not get a chai latte here. Worst chai latte I've had in my life, and it was extremely expensive to boot!"
100,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-154,2015-12-24,5,Great service & great food (especially the French toast). Keep in mind portions are big though!
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2019-11-23,3,i was in the westside of manhattan near 54th st and ran inside the nearby dd to  use up some free wifi and grab a hot chocolate while waiting for a friend but  not glad that it's tiny inside with no seating as it's order grab and go and  its a bit cold outside . typical dd and nothing to get glee about but the hot chocolate aint bad and the wifi is strong so its all good in the westside manhatty hood.
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2019-07-12,5,"You can always count on a great cup of coffee at DD. When everything and everywhere is not getting it right, go to DD.

Lines are usually long, but they are quick. Lots of employees available for your morning rush needs."
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2019-06-21,5,"Location is tiny but they have very fast service, friendly employees and the food / donuts was fresh."
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2018-11-14,3,"Coffee was ok, not great. Prices 25% higher than DDs outside of NYC. Small store front, no tables. Nothing special."
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2018-10-23,5,"I like this Dunkin' Donuts even small. Sometimes there is a huge line to get coffee but their stuff are nice. I believe that, they should hire one more person to register and 2 more people should be back for food and coffee preparation. Last thing, most Dunkin' had order and go! Because of this place is so small, the couldn't do that. If they increase there staffs I think everything should be better"
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2018-09-10,5,Came here with the wife at 9pm after dinner.  Purchased a glazed donut and it was fresh.  We left.  While leaving I was enjoying the donut so much that I turned back and bought THREE more glazed donuts.  Nice and fresh.  Let's keep this a secret. But the cashier hooked it up with three donuts for the price of one ;) customer service can't get any better than that !!!
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2018-07-18,1,"This morning, I had a very unpleasant experience at this location. I have been staying here for a convention since Friday and I have pretty much visited this place every day.  Today I went in and ordered two breakfast sandwiches, two iced teas and a hot chocolate. I paid for my order and waited on my sandwiches. The tea were unsweetened eventhough I asked for sweet, I had them put additional shots in it. When I finally received my sandwiches, I asked for a grape jelly and knife. I was told it will be an additional cost. Excuse me! Since when did DD start charging customers who purchase breakfast sandwiches for grape jelly. I told the lady, I have been here for the past 3 days and I've never had to pay so why now. Also, if this was an additional charge, then you need to note that on your menu. The only male worker in there decided to want to argue with me and while I was still standing there, made comments about no more giving discounts. This took me by surprise because I paid for my meal and at no point did I ask for a discount on anything. I love DD and will keep going back but definitely not back to this location. Your workers behavior is unacceptable and his choice to want to argue with me and his demeanor as though he wanted to physically fight me speaks volume. He even went as far as to not want to hand over the jelly and I had to tell him several times, give me the jelly so I can get out of here. He also had no regards to the customers waiting patiently in line. The establishment was packed and he chose to pick a fight over A GRAPE JELLY."
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2017-11-11,3,Quite small / crowded and the donuts didn't seem too fresh on Saturday morning but it was overall okay
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2017-09-12,4,"Very busy area, located in the city. Any store you go to in Manhattan,  it will be busy. However,  got the chocolate and vanilla cream donut of the month, with large iced coffee. I have to say it was tasty, but the iced coffee was a bit pricey. Paying over 3 bucks for iced coffee is a bit expensive."
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2017-07-31,5,"I had a great experience with the customer service at this Dunkin today. Also, when you buy a frozen coffee, they give you a free donut!"
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2016-07-24,4,"Space is tiny. 

No dining area. 

Small, stand up ledge/counter that can fit two diners, maximum 

Beverages come out quickly. Sandwiches take some time..too much time

Staff are extremely pleasant

Standard pricing -- NO COMBOS at this location, everything is priced separately"
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2016-06-01,5,"I know this is a chain, but I think good service needs to be recognized. This DD is super efficient and the staff is always pleasant! I'm going to try to go here more often than the Starbucks located in my office building."
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2016-04-26,3,"Dunkin Donuts is my favorite spot for iced tea. It's inexpensive, it's plain black tea with no frills and you can get a lemon. I used their app religiously, but lately, a lot more $$ is being taken off with each visit - $7 instead of the $1.50 it should be, for instance. This has happened on at least three locations. DD customer service has not been helpful over email, and has certainly not employed any type of customer is always right, even if they can see all of my transactions to see they're overcharging.

As an aside, with the 8th Ave location closing, this is my closest Dunkin when I'm in NYC. The workers are friendly and generally quick. I've never had an issue with my order here."
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2016-04-01,2,"Good morning
Restaurant is clean and visual appealing. Fast and speedy service with friendly smiley faces, but I had to repeat my order 3 times. I ordered the Big n toasted sandwich , that comes with cheddar cheese, egg, & bacon. I wanted no cheese and I got ONE slice of bacon. No cheese and light bacon apparently. Sandwich was good just missed the bacon. Welcome to New York!"
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2016-03-30,2,I'm convinced they prepare the munchkin cups with old munchkins.... Shame on you! The best DD is on 44th and 6th. Fresh munchkin cups all the time.
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2016-01-20,4,"Great location for a Dunkin....but the place is WAY too small. often, there are people waiting outside on line or having to yell their order 4 people back because there just isn't enough room.

Despite all of this, I am giving this DD 4 star because I am never waiting for too long. Things move fast and the employees are always pleasant. 

It matters."
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2015-04-04,5,It's a very tiny shop but great service and team. Just great guys and felt very welcome.
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2015-04-01,3,"Okay, I've been going to this place a lot more recently and they've seemed to have gotten their act together.  The team in the morning is awesome.   They keep things moving so getting coffee is generally quick and easy, even when there's a line.  

Now that they have the right people, I go there almost every day.

The only drawback is that there are still a lot of idiot tourists who come here and feel the need to spend five minutes decided what they want while the line backs up out the door.  Hey morons, if you don't know what you want, step aside and let other people order!  And news flash...it's donuts.  None of them taste that much different and if you order any of the awful sandwiches, you deserve what you get.   But otherwise, welcome to New York!  Make sure you spend lots of money.  Thanks."
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2015-03-21,5,The best coffee place in the area!  Great coffee...Great owners.... Stop in and grab a cup of coffee
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2014-05-23,2,"Bad service here. 

Barely speak English, got my order wrong, gave bad attitude when i mentioned the mistake. Bum asking for change while I'm waiting for my coffee and bagel.

But coffee is good and cheap, thats why i keep coming back, even after this kind of treatment."
101,dunkin-new-york-70,2014-04-23,4,"First, I don't get coffee at 7am, let alone wake up at 7am. You guys can come in whenever you feel like it, but do it before 8am :)

It's super convenient for me, it's right downstairs and isn't called Starbucks. It's DD... can't go wrong... Just don't order food, they don't have anything that isn't common right now.

I guess it's still new.


11/20/2014 Review
Their efficiency has improved so much. For a tiny Dunkin Donuts shop, it is as good as it gets. I can now get my coffee and food in less than 3 minutes once the order is in the system."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-11-16,4,"Great spot for lunch or breakfast. 
Plenty of seats and it moves pretty quick. 
The price is dead on as well. Everyday they have a different special. Staff if friendly and the place is clean. Tons of options from full breakfast to small yogurts. I'll be back for sure."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-11-03,5,Don't know why they have such a low rating! Great bagels and super friendly staff!!! We came during the NYC marathon and it was fast and delicious!!
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-10-06,1,I've been here three times. All three times they messed up my order. Today the cashier even realized it was messed up and corrected the guy and then I got home and found out it was still wrong. A bagel with 2-3 items shouldn't be hard to make.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-10-04,1,"Lack inventory or variety to order/choose from. 
Lacking customer service. 
I felt an energy of racism. It was better when I ordered from here a few months ago, different workers and customer service was 5 stars. 
Now I don't know what happened to management but never again will I spend my hard earned money in an establishment just to be disrespected."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-08-17,4,"I've only had bagels and cream cheese. I really like the bagels. This place is right across the street from my apartment and I'm really glad it is...I've just moved to NYC, so I'll update when I have tried more places to compare this to. For right now though, love the bagels!"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-07-23,1,"One of the worst bagels I've gotten in NYC. My order was simple - bagel toasted with cream cheese and tomato. The tomato was sour and rotten (and I was charged $1.50 for 2 slices) and immediately removed it. The bagel and cream cheese were somehow both tasteless and did not taste fresh.

Do yourself a favor and walk up a few blocks to Bagelworks for a delicious bagel experience."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-06-20,1,it is illegal in ny to accept credit cards amd still require customers to spend a minimum amount. i will report this business to the bbb every day if i have to until they change.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-06-09,1,"This is second visit, again horrible service! Won't come back. There is Dunkin around the corner, yiu should go there!"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-05-08,4,While visiting NYC I was looking for a good bagel place close by. I found Daily Bagel. A large selection of smears and bagels. The people behind the counter were fast and friendly and my everything bagel with jalapeno smear was toasted perfectly. I will be back the next time I am in town.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-04-19,1,"I waited 30 minutes for an omelette and they didn't even get it right, place wasn't even that busy, I'd give the food 2 stars"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-03-17,1,Had a crispy chicken sandwich. The chicken was Rock hard and literally black in some spots. Must of been very old. I couldn't eat it.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2019-01-19,5,"Grabbed two eggs and cheese on a bagel. Everything was fresh, hot, and delicious. Staff was friendly and efficient despite the Saturday morning line."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-12-11,5,"1st time here, up upon being greeted by a kind young lady I ordered the Hawaiian wrap and a lg hot latte made to perfection with a dash of cinnamon on top just the way I like. Joe Costa the owner also greeted and served us. Great sandwich, latte and service. Thank you kindly for your attention to detail."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-12-02,1,"This was my third time throwing money away at this joke of an establishment.  Let me tell you about my most recent visit this afternoon.   

I had just finished my insane workout at the Equinox next door.  I ripped 4 pullups and rode the recumbent bike for 6 minutes (level 3). I'm all about efficency, value and results.  The results?  Amazing.   

Anyways, after this workout i stopped into the daily bagel for a turkey sandwich on rye.  Fairly simple order with lackluster results (see above for my thoughts on results).  The bread was stale.  The turkey tasted like horse and the price was a gdamn joke.  

And now for the employees.  I believe that the vetting process in order to work here consists of being someone who huffs lead paint no less than 6hrs daily and grew up in an asbestos riddled household.  Also, prior to their shifts starting another staff member hits them in the head viciously with a cast iron frying pan to ensure a severe concussion prior to serving customers.  Now I appreciate the unorthodox hiring and customer service practices but I don't think this strategy leads to strong (or any) customer retention.

In conclusion. If you are thinking about food from the Daily Bagel I would suggest going across the street to Bed N Bath and eating a tube of toothpaste (spearmint preferably but peppermint is allowed.)"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-09-30,1,Find another bagel spot and save yourself the money.  They over charge for food and terrible employees. No one speaks English.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-09-30,1,Worst place ever. Staff is incredibly incompetent. The owner needs to do immediate turnover. Go to another place because they are stealing your money
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-09-12,3,"what i like about this bagel shop and then some is that bagels are made in house which means if you stop by at the right time you will have your variety of hot fresh bagels . good selection of bagels with plenty of assorted spreads . the muffins and salads are decent but stick with the bagels and some cream cheese which will be good enough with some coffee or whatever beverage you may like .the prices are a bit high but it's manhattan so expect it but the counter folks are fairly quick and stuff the bagels above average and decent amount of tables spaced out for added elbow room  . daily bagel on 1st ave may not be the best bagel shop in nyc but it holds its own with a passing grade . 3.5 stars on my yelp meter cause If you don't want bagels you can grab some cereal , eggs on a roll , donuts ,etc."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-09-01,2,"Mediocre food but the worst part is that their large iced coffee is probably 16 oz and costs $4. That's more expensive than Starbucks. And the coffee is watered down. I hate when I forget this fact, so I'm writing it down so I remember next time."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-08-24,4,The bagel tasted super fresh and was cooked perfecly.  The vegetable cream cheese was delicious as well.  Very nice spot.. their danish case looked very tempting as well!

They have a nice build your own salad bar. Grab a container of the type greens you want and a guy at the fixings bar will customize it for you."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-07-26,4,"had a medical procedure done so i was not permitted to eat since the day before....so, I was starving (lol) and left the hospital with a singular goal. Find something to eat! I walked into this shop..pleasant surprise ..made their own bagels on site..real bagels..not that crap that is passed off as bagels...crisp on the outside...i ordered nova, pumpernickel bagel with veg cream cheese and onion...for the non NYer...smoked salmon from Nova Scotia... the result was a lox bagel and cream cheese that would make my mother proud! Lots of lox, lots of cream cheese...no skimping and not expensive...Zabars would have charged 30% more."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-07-08,3,"I got the onion bagel with scallion cream cheese (I was feeling this combo...don't judge). The bagel itself was great, it was super soft and fresh and cream cheese was decent. Nothing really stuck out to me about this restaurant. The price was okay for what you get."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-06-19,2,"poor selection for salads. have no beans except for red beans (no black beans, no chickpeas). i'd go elsewhere to get lunch!"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-04-07,1,The lady at the counter doesn't know how to run the counter. She says I will get a manager when the boss isn't even there. They made a mistake on my order and would not correct it. The staff is incompetent and I've never had an issue here before until today. Horrible experience never going back. My coworkers frequent here all the time I would have never expected this kind of service on the upper east side let alone a residential area. Week days are great but maybe getting someone that understands how to run a restaurant on the counter is the manager isn't in on weekends. Very very very disappointed!
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-04-05,1,A large ice coffee is 3.95+++ with taxes$4.30. Deli coffee fyi. Starbucks across the street VENTI ice coffee 2.95+++ shocking ripped off.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-04-01,1,The worst cream cheese I've ever had. I couldn't even finish 2 bites of the scallion CC. So awful. I will never go back there again
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-03-29,2,"woof. this place is bad news. im not gonna say its the worst news, but you can do a lot better. bagel places generally have the longest lines, but aside from the wait, daily b never gets your order correct and is hella expensive. their bagels are good but i am wary after the numerous health code violations."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2018-01-15,1,"I called and ordered bagels yesterday. They delivered the order incorrectly. Then they resent it and they left out one of the bagels. When I called to tell them they got the order wrong again, the manager refused to resend the bagels again even though it was now 2 hours after I ordered and it was their fault that they got the order wrong.  I would advise not to go there. Not only is the manager beyond rude, when they take your order over the phone they rush you and they don't understand english so the order is always wrong when it arrives. I would recommend walking to Bagel Works. They are much more professional and they always get the order correct."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-12-31,2,"Most expensive bagel shop I have ever been to. They charged me $3.54 for a bagel and cream cheese. I get bacon egg and cheeses for $3.50 at places around the neighborhood, but I tried to give these guys a shot. Very disappointed."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-12-08,1,"This cost $3.95. 
Need I say more why it only gets 1 star?
Bagel with scallion cream cheese was OK. Not a great NYC bagel, but better than the ""bagels"" at the supermarket that come in a package of 5."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-11-29,4,"I have walked by this place for many years (en route to Bed Bath Beyond). And I used to love Bistro 61 but never thought to stop in. 

I decided to order in and can't understand these horrible reviews. 

BEST bagel I have had in a long time. And much cheaper than Pick-A-Bagel. 

Also 20 ounces of green juice with ginger for 8.95 is decent. Often the 12 ounces are 9 bucks. Fast delivery. 

Vegetable cream cheese as good as Pick-a-Bagel which has the audacity to charge 3.75 for this portion. 

Because it was cheap and I was ordering anyway, I got a blueberry bagel, which I haven't had in 20 years. 

I'm happy to have found this place."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-11-24,1,These little sneaky creeps have been robbing me of my change for lord knows how long. The two spanish guys that work in the evening are straight crooks and should be deported immediately.  I always get the wrong change and they always act like its a mistake. Count your change and send ICE in to clean up these losers
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-09-05,2,"I went here for breakfast with a friend. The bagels were great, your typical soft and chewy NYC bagel, no problems there. The mini heart black and white cookies look cute but they are not the real deal. These cookies were crumbly, dry and bland. I would definitely skip them. The service left a lot to be desired. First off, while standing in line none of the workers behind the deli asked me for my order. Somehow I made it all the way to the cash register and was asked to go back to the end of the line to order. The line took forever, even though they were not that busy they cashier kept asking the couple in front of me over and over what they had ordered. Maybe they should write it down? 

Given the fact that there is a plethora of deli's in new york, I will be looking else where to meet my bagel needs."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-08-23,2,"Very expensive, but I'm not sure why.   $6.50 for an egg sandwich and $2.75 for a 12oz (330ml) bottle of orange juice.   The sandwich was tasty enough, but then its hard to get bacon, egg, and cheese wrong.  I asked for my eggs scrambled, but the yoke and the white are clearly not combined."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-08-16,3,"Not a bad place. Didn't see any health grades and apparently this place got shut down by the health inspector but we didn't have a bad experience. 

We got two bagels and the lunch special gyro with fries. A blueberry bagel w strawberry cream cheese and a onion bagel with sun dried tomato cream cheese was $7.50. My gyro with fries and a water was $8.17 including tax. Nothing was bad. The fries are freshly grilled and the gyro is like your average gyro. Not bad. The two Latino men on staff weren't rude and helped us decide what we wanted."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-08-07,1,"Edit: hope this place shuts down for good. Just heard it was on the news for health violation... 
No refunds sign was already displayed. Apparently this place messes up orders often. Looked forward to eating here. Will never be back because of the shitshow service.
Rude Latina cashier. She's sounds so much nicer speaking her language towards the girl in front of me. But when it came my turn she coldly took my money. No smile or farewell. Latino taking orders seem to never heard of a pen and paper. He took orders verbally which unsurprisingly resulted in messing up my and my boyfriend's order. I repeated to him twice what I wanted and he still forgot the bacon and specific bagel...."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-07-30,1,"Health Inspectors closed this place down for over several violations they even came out in the news.  Even though I went to this place multiple times I thank God I didn't get sick.  They are very pricey at times the average lunch is 15.00 dollars.  They were so many flies on those Bagels and I told the workers that just doesn't look appetizing.  
EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I will never go back to this place ever again."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-07-11,1,"Health inspectors have shut this place down. It's even in the news. I've never gone but just read about it.

102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-06-06,3,"I got the whitefish salad here on an everything, and while it was pretty good, it wasn't the best bagel either. The lettuce didn't seem particularly fresh, and the whitefish was saltier than other places. However, the location is pretty convenient and it's nice being on a street corner. I didn't get any coffee, but the variety of drinks seemed pretty interesting, although nothing seemed like great value, including the bagel itself. It's an ok place to stop by in the morning on your way to work, but not worth going out of the way for."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-05-20,2,"Probably not bad if you're a regular but not worth seeking out. Cashier lady messed up giving me the correct order because she was too busy chatting with a customer. When I walked back, she made it seem it was my fault  and why didn't I say something when she told me. Just rude and unnecessary. Maybe if you paid more attention to customers and less to socializing, people in the area would go there more. NEVER had this happen at Bagelworks."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-04-02,2,They always make mistakes. Burned my sandwich a few times. They try to save money on their protein shakes by using mostly ice. Buying shakes at equinox instead. Nox for life.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-03-09,3,"There are times I want to give Daily Bagel 5 stars and then there are times I want to cry and throw away my burnt bacon, egg and non-melted cheese. So, I'll be fair and stick to 3 stars. The guys that work here are so sweet, I can't even get mad at them when my order gets messed up. When they're not rushing, my bacon, egg and cheese always turns out amazing!! I always tell them to make sure my bagel isn't burnt haha. The salad bar in the back is pretty great too! One thing that I've noticed is the cashier always charges a different amount every time I'm there!! And it's always more money getting added on. I don't feel like arguing since there's usually a line in the morning, but I've noticed it and I also saw other reviews that mentioned it as well. It's the closest bagel shop to me so it's my go-to."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-02-08,5,Ok best bagel in NYC .. in my 27 years of living in NY I have never eaten a bagel without cream cheese but these bagels are good enough to eat without - I got soup here and it came with a free ww everything bagel which I was surprised I liked even though it had no cream cheese. I also get Greek salad wraps here which are very good. Really surprised to see the other reviews here!
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-01-24,2,"Was excited to have this a block from my office until I ordered soup a few weeks ago and discovered some small critters at the bottom. Called daily bagel to let them know they said ""ok thanks we'll take care of it"" and nothing else. Have not gone back since. Overpriced, ok service and not great quality."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2017-01-09,1,"microwaved chicken cutlet on a roll for $9, rude service...do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-12-31,5,Seriously one of the best Tuna bagels sandwiches I've ever had. The bagel itself was delicious. First time here and didn't try anything else.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-11-30,5,"We were in NYC for 5days 11/23/16-11/27, and we ate at the Daily Bagel 3-4 times.  The bagels were amazing, the Green Juice was great, service was quick and friendly and the prices were right!  The selection and freshness of all menu items was fabulous!  I wish we had this joint in Orlando, FL!"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-11-20,4,"We order delivery here for breakfast often and it is consistently fast and fresh.  Bagels are large and always fresh and you can't beat the prices for their fresh juices compared to some other spots nearby.  Good spot if you are looking for eggs, bagels, and other simple breakfast items.  They also have a lot of great cream cheese selections."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-11-05,3,"It's always hard for me to write a mediocre review for a place where the staff is as friendly and eager to please as that at Daily Bagel. This deli has a lot of potential and I hope it takes an upswing.

The location is extremely convenient as it's right on first avenue. The deli itself is great for a quick in-and-out visit and the space is open, clean and comfortable. There are plenty of chairs and tables if you'd like to sit and have a place to eat with coworkers and friends. Service, like others have mentioned, is a little bumbly but they are very friendly and do try their absolute best. I have never had an issue with food quality and everything I've gotten from here has been great. My favorite thing here is the udon soup station near the back. You get your pick of unlimited veggie toppings and the soup is steaming hot and flavorful.

My only big gripe with Daily Bagel are their price. It does seem a bit high, even taking into consideration the Manhattan area and higher rents. A large iced coffee here is almost $4 and the average sandwich around $9, which makes coming to Daily Bagel multiple times a week rather financially irresponsible for me.

All in all, Daily Bagel is a decent deli but improving on some flaws would really make it a staple in the neighborhood."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-09-03,2,"Bagels are solidly OK, usually not fresh and very middle of the road.  Glacial service.  Pastries are also mediocre. Overall feeling that the management just doesn't care. Jumbo Bagels on Second and 56th is a better bet all around when it comes to quality, freshness and service."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-08-19,3,Very very expensive. Makes you feel like they don't care about the customer and just turning profit.  I only go there when I'm feeling very lazy.  Isn't extra $2 for avocado on your bagel excessive tho?!?
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-07-30,5,"We were staying nearby and gave  this place a shot for breakfast. A plus is they have seating to eat inside. Service was fast and friendly, at the counter. Bagels were great, food was good."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-07-27,2,"When Daily Bagel first opened, their food was very good and reasonably priced. My gym is on the same block and I often stopped by for a customized salad (with free bagel) or a Chicken Delite Wrap - grilled chicken/avocado/red pepper/lettuce with balsamic vinegar - to take home after a workout. On weekends, I'd opt for a garlic bagel, scallion cream cheese, Nova and capers.

Unfortunately, over time, the prices have gone up and the food quality has plummeted. I'm no longer a customer."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-07-22,1,"Definitely always order from their grubhub! They increase the prices if you go on person!!

I wanted a simple smoothie that is $7.95 on grubhub. I ordered it in person and had to pay $11!! I tried to show them the item on grubhub, and they did not honor the pit ice listed. 

This place is a scam!"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-07-09,1,"Worst bagel place in the neighborhood - gave the place a chance a number of times - every time placing a simple order - they screw it up. And the worst you have to wait 15 minutes just to pay . 
If you go check your order before you leave !!"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-07-05,4,Nice little bagel shop on corner of first avenue . Had an egg bacon on a roll. A little pricey but overall great place to sit and relax for breakfast . The also had a chocolate croissant which I have not had in a long time. Yummy yummy.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-06-18,1,"Terrible value!

A whole wheat breakfast wrap with eggs, cheese and turkey bacon = $8.98!!!

Most places across the neighborhood charge $4.50-6.00 for the same item. I believe this same item was previously about $6...not sure why the price went up by ~50%. The staff at the register confirmed the $8.98 price when I challenged what seemed like a mistake or joke.

Aside from the outrageous price, it tasted fine - but was light on the eggs. 

Summary: Avoid Daily Bagel at all costs!"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-06-01,3,"I can echo many of the other reviews about service and incompetence. I go to DB several times a week but it is only because of convenience. 

Their food is fresh but they often mess up orders. Whenever confronted they are apologetic and quick to fix. Prices are inconsistent and their order/paying system needs to be fixed. It is especially painful when there are a lot of coffee orders. 

Hopefully they get their act together"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-05-25,2,"Food is decent, albeit overpriced. Service is beyond horrible. The owner really needs to take a serious look at staffing issues. Been going there since it opened given I work locally. As of today, done."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-05-01,1,"They can't get ONE order right from behind the counter. If your order has more than 1 ingredient, they will surely mess it up. A combination of the dumbest staff in the world with lazy people and terrible management. I would rather die than go back."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-04-29,1,They messed up my order and then tried to overcharge me for it. The food isn't even that good. I won't be going back there again and told them that too.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-04-25,3,"If you're in the mood for a bagel, this is the place to go. If you want anything else, go elsewhere. Their omlettes and ""paninis"" are overpriced and really not good."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-04-02,1,Just found a black hair in my tuna sandwich. Spoke to the cashier and he showed the cooks who just started laughing.  Do not come here unless you want extra hair with your tuna.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-02-26,1,"Simple, Go to bagelworks or any other bagel spot in the neighborhood.

On numerous occasions this place has been slow, staff forgets orders and prepares incorrect orders. The food is very bland and mediocre."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-02-08,1,"In summary: Food is bland. Service is slow. Prices are too high even for Manhattan. Coworkers clearly having side convos of patrons in Spanish. 

In detail: I waited nearly 20 mins (did they bake the bread first?) for French toast w/ a side of turkey bacon, NO eggs. Before telling the ""chef"" my order, the person who took my order mentioned turkey bacon would be $1 extra- multiple times (check your cameras) Okay no prob.
Time to pay: sometimes the cashier gives my 10% city discount, sometimes she doesn't. Whatevs don't mind paying the tax, that's life.  However, what I don't have tolerance for is brainlessness. 
I was charged 7.95 + $2.00 for the turkey bacon in my order- based on the only French toast on their menu was the ""platter specials"" (#3- French toast + 2 eggs + bacon or sausage + free 10oz coffee)
A) Jose over there told me it was $1 extra multiple times (cashier shrugs)
B) do you see any eggs on my plate? Why am I paying the a higher price FOR LESS FOOD? Not even willing to waive the $2 up charge for the 2 slices of turkey bacon (cashier shrugs again)
C) if you're charging me for the platter, where's my ""free coffee""? Found out I'm not entitled to one bc I didn't order the platter- yet they charged me for it. Got it. My money will go elsewhere. This rating stays here.

Other bagel places nearby: bagel works, cafe fresco, lennys- all conveniently on the same side of the avenue too."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-01-24,2,"The reason for the low rating is that on more than one occasion, Daily Bagel has sold the previous day's bagels when they were short staffed. If they are going to sell day-old bagels, the price should be steeply discounted. If there has been any kind of inclement weather the day before and you want a fresh bagel in the morning, do NOT go here."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2016-01-04,1,"I'm even more disappointed with Daily Bagel then I was originally. I went in at noon to order a breakfast sandwich and found out that I owed an extra $1.50 because they apparently stop serving breakfast sandwiches after 11 AM. As if it's that much of a hassle to reach into the fridge and crack an egg on the grill! I would understand (slightly more so) if Daily Bagel stopped serving breakfast altogether after 11 AM, which is not an uncommon practice. However, they still serve it, it's just that after 11 you owe them even more money than the exorbitant amount you would already be paying.

Again, there are much better places to grab yourself a bagel on the UES. As someone who's been living above DB for a year and a half now, I urge you to steer clear."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-12-27,1,Count your change. The guy taking cash at the register tried to short me $10 bucks. Saw him counting and he counted a 10 as a 20. I called him out on it - he recounted the change and tried to pull the same con. Watch out. btw the bagels are average and the line moves slow.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-12-20,1,Terrible service. Line is always way too long. Staff is slow. Cashier is rude and disrespectful. He yelled at 3 customers in a row telling them that they are confusing him. I was appalled. Can't complain about the bagels and cream cheese though.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-12-15,3,"The food is good but make sure you don't ask for an omelette sandwich with a bagel on the side, $2 charge for no reason. Seems to have high unjustified additional charges for simple things like this."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-12-05,1,I'm very disappointed by the rudeness and unprofessionalism of the cashier lady at Daily bagel. She is incredibly disrespectful and condescending to customers and clearly hates her job. I wouldn't be surprised if she spits in the customers' food. I placed an order on Seamless for pickup and happened to be walking my dog this morning. I tried to go in while carrying my dog to let her know I'm waiting outside the store for my order. She then kicks me out of the store for not allowing dogs and tells me no one will bring my order outside the restaurant. So basically I cannot get the food I paid for. I've been a very loyal and valuable customer at this place and I can safely say I will not be returning or recommending this place to any friends who live in the neighborhood. I will only return if that lady gets fired for ruining the reputation of Daily Bagel. Such a shame.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-12-01,2,"I came back here today. I really was craving an egg sandwich and it's located so conveniently near my job. Once again, I did not have cash on me and had to find a way to meet their $5 minimum. I told the guy behind the counter ""egg and cheese on a scooped out whole wheat bagel."" He asked me something I did not understand and then after him repeating it 3x, I realized he was asking me what kind of cream cheese I wanted. I said no ""egg and cheese."" He replied okay, I got it, but I knew it didn't. I just had a feeling. I only repeated that I wanted itscooped out, but should have said the whole order again, because of course it got messed up. I know egg and cheese on a bagel is $4.08, at least that's what it was the last time I got it so I asked for avocado to raise the price by a dollar which worked out. When I got to the office, before I went upstairs, I had a feeling I should check the sandwich, but didn't and of course when I got to my desk I realized he gave me a plain bagel instead of whole wheat. Whatever. First world problems. I ate it and made a mental note to speak slowly and clearly and have them repeat the order back to me 3x if I ever go back there again...emphasis on if."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-11-13,3,"Since I was NY, I figure I would pick up a bagel for breakfast.  As this was in walking distance I came here.  Got the 2 eggs, bacon platter with a toast garlic bagel.

First off if you are on the run, this is a better go stop as everything was served pretty quickly.  The eggs, bacon & home fries were ok. The bagel itself was tasty!  It's different from the standard ones out in the west coast.  I would definitely come back for the bagels and to try the assorted flavored cream cheeses."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-10-18,1,"I went to get 2 bagels today.  I got there at 12:15pm on a Sunday and it was pretty packed.  I ordered one of my bagels and I waited 10 minutes, they totally forgot my order.  I got their attention and re-ordered.  This time they screwed up my order (I asked to get my bagel toasted and they didn't toast it).  I pointed it out and they re-did my bagel.  I came home and noticed that they toasted the bagel, but they gave me the wrong cream cheese and didn't scoop out the bagel like I asked for.  Now I'm fuming.  So I go back to Daily Bagel to tell them that they screwed up my order AGAIN!!  DO NOT GO HERE, THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-09-26,2,"I asked for an egg and cheese bagel, when I opened the package I had an Un-toasted bagel with a piece of cheese on it. When I asked them to fix it they had the audacity to charge me for the ""extra"" eggs. I will not be going back ...I suggest going to Bagelworks up the street."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-09-20,4,"Chewy bagels with a wide array of scrumptious cream cheese. It's sort of a deli also and a bakery all in one.... but definitely a solid joint for bagels. 

TIP: Ask to get half and half cream cheese, depending on who is serving you they'll let you choose half and half but sometimes they won't (bummer). I always get the garlic bagel with the chipotle cream cheese and sun dried tomato. Delicioussssssssss and eat when it's warm!!! Saving it for later will melt the cream cheese into a messy gooeyness."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-09-07,4,"Solid option for bagels and their accoutrements. Wide assortment of spreads. My favorite is the (stacked) sausage, egg, and cheese bagel.

Haven't tried any of the non-breakfast food but it looks decent. Pastries are a bit mundane."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-08-30,1,Totally overpriced and rude!!!! I've been here three times since opening and has always been very unorganized and have gotten orders wrong two out of the three times. Each time all personnel have been very rude! Was trying to give it another shot as it is so close to my place but I just rather walk a few more blocks to bagel works where the bagels are perfect and nobody is rude!
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-08-08,5,"My go-to neighbourhood breakfast place! I love creating my own fresh juices and salads, and the staff is always welcoming. Though the menu is massive, I usually settle with the chicken-avocado wrap for something more filling. As for the bagels, well, that's their specialty :)"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-08-06,2,"Too expensive, order took too long, and when I got back to the car I discovered they messed up the order.  I will not be back."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-07-30,5,Supeeeeeeer!!!!! I love it!!! Stuff is super nice and fast! Bagels is amazing... I took lox bagel and it was a lot a lot a lot of lox! A LOT! :) super good!
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-07-12,4,"Really good neighborhood bagel place. Really quick service, and great food. Beyond bagels, they have sandwiches, soups, salads, and really anything else that you may want to eat.

Whenever I need a bagel fast, I make sure to come here. Their spreads look delicious, and they have more cream cheese flavors than I can count. 

The only negatives are that their fruit flavored cream cheese (blueberry, strawberry, etc.) are too colorful for me. They look nice, but I imagine that they use a ton of food coloring. And there is an additional $1 fee for breakfast sandwiches after 11AM. These aren't major complaints, but just some things to keep in mind. 

They offer coffee as well and is a great one-stop breakfast stop."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-07-02,1,"It was such a mess here trying to get and pay for a bagel and water here this morning it felt like an episode of What Would You Do. The only thing that makes sense is that the owner is trying to lose money as a tax write off etc. 
There was a long line of mostly workers trying to get breakfast orders in. You think a bagel place would be thrilled construction workers would buy from them but one guy was practically chastised for having a biggish order.  The store workers were not organised at all and it was chaos with orders being received wrong, in bits and pieces etc. When you run this kind of place you need to work efficiently and get the customers out before their food is stone cold. I waited to pay while my daughter ate her bagel which was ok and she was half done by the time I got finished. A bagel place would be welcome as there is only a Starbucks across the street but I am not going back and I can't imagine guys on the clock are going to enjoy dithering away their mornings waiting for the correct order in a timely fashion. I am not blaming any individual worker as this is clearly a mgmt issue! Good luck!"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-06-27,3,"They are ""ok"". They are the closest bagel shop, so when I need a cup of coffee or bagel Saturday morning we will come here. Don't go out of your way; there are better places in the area. Also, the guys who work there are often very rude!
They have a juice bar which is a plus, but do not serve organic fruits and veggies, so, meh."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-06-26,1,"Just placed an order through seamless a very basic coffee and bagel AND THEY GOT IT ALL WRONG.

They delivered a completely different bagel than I ordered, didnt cut or toast the bagel (because its an additional 10c was their pthetic excuse) , coffee was delivered black, and the cream cheese was literally scooped out or even preused by someone else (look at picture)
AND they were unapologetic and demanded the food back.

Worst experience for something so basic.

You guys just lost a whole store as customers."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-06-22,4,"Happy to have a bagel place within a 2 block radius of my apartment! This place has dramatically improved since they opened a couple months ago. They were super unorganized, but I think that they have the weekend rush under control now. 

I usually go with an everything bagel. Always yummy. I have recently made the switch to whole wheat everything and they are equally as tasty. I've ordered a bunch of different combos from here as well. They have a salad bar in the back which I've never tried but I plan on doing so soon."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-06-19,4,"Great addition to the neighborhood.  Spacious, clean and pleasing to the eye.  They have Boars Head meats and I'm a fan.  I've only tried their lunch sandwiches so far and they have all been great and delicious.  I also find the service to be very friendly and welcoming.  One time they did forget to put cheese on my sandwich and when I went back up to the counter they were very nice about it."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-06-13,2,"The customer service here is just not acceptable, which is unfortunate since the food itself deserves a higher rating (great salads). I ordered their 2 Eggs Any Style special this AM which is $3 on a roll/bagel, or $5.95 as a platter. I asked for the first option but for my eggs to be placed on a plate instead of in a sandwich - he said no problem. When I was rung up by the woman at checkout, she insisted I pay double, $5.95, since I was having my eggs without the roll. I explained to her that I didn't order a platter (includes home fries/sides), but just wanted my eggs plopped on a plate as I'm trying to eat light, and that I was told it would be no problem. She would not honor this. Honestly if I hadn't been so hungry I would have just walked out, but my stomach made me do otherwise and have them place the eggs from the plate onto a roll so I wouldn't be charged double. Sadly this will no longer be my salad-go-to anymore! Not worth it."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-05-27,4,"I'll begin with the most important thing about Daily Bagel: the food. Upon entering the store, you'll encounter rows and rows of bagel baskets, each indicating one of several different types available. Of course you'll find your standard favorites - sesame, everything, pumpernickel - but you'll also discover less common options like sunflower seed.

The base price is $1.20 for the bagel itself (which is pretty average in Manhattan), and there are numerous spreads you can pair them with. So far, I've only tried the whole wheat everything, but the quality and taste have remained consistent. The texture is especially noteworthy; soft and chewy, with a relatively even distribution of toppings. There really isn't anything bad I can say about the bagels served here.

To comment on the customer service issues mentioned in other reviews, I've noticed that the majority of criticism derives from the unstructured process of standing in line to order & pay. Last time I was here, one of the employees inadvertently skipped over the man in front of me, thinking he had already been helped (which clearly frustrated the customer). I won't deny that these mixups are cultivating an overall negative depiction of the business, but certain aspects can be improved by something as simple as a rope line to foster a more organized system. Daily Bagel is still figuring it all out in terms of its service, but at least I know where to go if I'm looking to buy a quick, affordable breakfast nearby!"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-05-24,5,Probably my new favorite bagel spot in the city.  A bit pricey for a bacon egg and cheese ($6) but worth every single penny.  Highly recommend!!
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-05-12,3,The food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable. It's really nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood with so many meal options. The only downfall is that the service is painfully slow. I waited half an hour for a sandwich when it wasn't even that busy.
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-04-19,5,"I ordered a 2-egg bagel sandwich with sausage and cheese.  the bagel was good and fresh, the sausage and eggs were cooked and tasty, and the delivery was fast.  10/10 would ruin my diet again!"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-04-05,1,"Have tried this place three times and each was severely disappointing.

1 - Bagels are clearly never boiled and therefore are a baked, soft doughy mess. If you're into that (and have no sense of taste), then you'll love this place.

2 - I ordered a breakfast platter through seamless that included coffee. To make a long story short, I ended up in a fight with the manager on the phone who claimed the included coffee was a grand opening special and was no longer honored. Why is it still on the menu?

3 - Went for my last time this morning. The place was not busy, but I could not get the attention of any of the three workers chatting amongst themselves to order. Finally asked for a blueberry muffin. Opened it when I got home - it's cranberry.

These people are incompetent."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-03-26,3,"I think Daily Bagel is a GREAT addition to the neighborhood. The food is delicious and fresh. I do, however, want to make a strong comment regarding the customer service.

My apartment happens to be across the street so I get my dinner from daily bagel AT LEAST 5 out of 7 nights per week, plus breakfast one weekends. The evening staff is nothing but lovely and helpful, they will go above and beyond to make sure you feel welcome. The morning staff is a different story. Although the following experience has nothing to do with their food specifically, I feel it is important to mention in a world (and specifically a business) where I can purchase the same food at 3 other locations within a one block radius - customer service is what really sets you aside. 

I left my phone there one evening at 8:55pm. The evening staff locked the door behind me as I walked out so I know for fact I was the last customer. I got up early the next morning and went to the shop at 6:15 before too many people had been in. I was ""greeted"" by Vincent, the morning ""manager"", who had an outrageously arrogant attitude and even accused me of lying about having left it there. He said they had cameras, so I asked to see them. Whether or not they had the phone (which they did, sitting JUST behind the register), the level of attitude, unhelpfulness and accusatory behavior was unlike I had ever experienced in a customer service driven environment. I was finally able to get to a computer to ""find my iPhone"" and make it ""ping"". At which point, I went back and picked it up  - I told Vincent that there was no excuse for his attitude and accusations and his defense was ""Well, you shouldn't have left your phone"".  Ignoring the fact that the phone was sitting directly in plain sight behind the register the entire time, the behavior of the morning staff, specifically Vincent, is something I felt was completely out of line. 

I value customer service more than the food in this case, as I mentioned, I could give you a list of alternative places to get a bagel or coldcuts within the one block around the shop."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-03-17,5,"I go here at least once a week since it's opening.  While service was absolutely terrible the first week or two, the staff has become much more comfortable it seems.  The bagels never disappoint and while I've never had anything on it but cream cheese, I'm not complaining.

Nice selection of both bagels & spreads.


FYI $5 minimum to use a debit/credit card"
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-02-28,1,"No good!!!! Disappointed !!!!! Went for cup of coffee and a bagel.. Bagel itself was a ok.... Ordered tofu vegy cream-cheese and coffe with soy milk. When I got my bagel ... I could hardly notice any cream cheese on it, but when I opened my coffee , my eyes rolled up. Milk was sour... Ok. No biggie. Went nicely to the cashier guy and asked him to check my cup and do something about it. I had to wait good 10 min until he turned towards me, there were other workers and two more customers standing on line. Rudely he told me that:"" this is Soy milk is support to be in hot liquid""??!!! Really ??? Like, this is my first time ordering coffee with Soy milk. He defiantly took Soy milk pack out of the fridge and pointed to me that expiration day is fine, then in the same manner tested the milk  and asked me what do I want ..??? I asked for regular milk.... 
I wouldn't recommend this place for two reasons: first, unprofessional and rude stuff. Second, for the price they charge, skimpy portions."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-02-24,3,"I've had a few decent bagels here at this point. Not mind blowing, but no complaints."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-02-20,1,"it's really a shame this place has such poor customer service and indifferent (at best) ownership. yes, this kind of place is needed in the neighborhood. (i've lived a couple blocks away for many years and was happy to see this shop open.) but they seem to suddenly lose all language skills when a customer tries to engage. apparently particularly when it comes to price discrepancies. (which is odd since they have a very detailed menu posted.) i went in within the first week. the person who took my order was lovely (i can't imagine employees sticking around too long) but my cashier was rude. and i saw what was likely one of the owners surveying the goods in the case, etc., while i was sitting right nearby and never once did he make eye contact. (i saw a van from queens arrive and he and some others run out to unload.) a welcoming presence would be good for a business especially when it's new. yeah, i didn't review the food here even though i had an egg sandwich (which was adequate) because i just don't care and I won't be back. if the service is abysmal, why give them business? it's important to support small local businesses but they in no way deserve patronage when they clearly don't care about the community they're serving. and in fact are rude and dismissive. plus they seem to be playing games with the prices. i don't go for that. so, no way. hope they close for good sooner rather than later. good riddance."
102,daily-bagel-new-york,2015-02-17,1,"I was very excited for this place to open, since the food options in the area are limited. However, this place was a major disappointment - food-wise, price-wise and service-wise. The biggest let down of the place is the inconsistency with the cashiers working there. They either need better training or the place needs to establish clearer price points. Every time I have gone in there for my breakfast sandwhich- a whole wheat bagel with egg whites and spinach, I am charged different prices, usually ranging between 5.50-6.50. However, this time (the last time I ever go in there), I was charged 7.57 for the same item. I let the cashier know about the error in the price and he shook his head without saying a word. The manager behind him also did the same. I would advise customers to buy their food elsewhere, unless they don't mind inconsistent pricing and being charged $8 for a simple sub-par breakfast sandwich."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2020-03-01,4,Great place to go for a quick bit and/or study. The turmeric latte was quite great but the chocolate croissant could be better (perhaps more chocolate flavor?)
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2020-01-02,5,This is my go-to weekend coffee spot. They make a great latte and I also like their cold brew in the warmer months.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2019-10-10,5,The best coffee ever! I love the banana bread from here. They always have fresh coffee and a variety of pastries and sandwiches. The environment is very pleasant so it's a good place to enjoy your drink. I almost rated the place 4 stars because I think the people that work behind the counter should smile more but the coffee is so good that I had to give the establishment 5 stars.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2019-10-06,5,"This place made an amazing espresso. 

Their summer flavors are definitely worth a buy.

Their customer service was great and the barista's are good at customizing orders.

They are peanut butter cookies are great too.

I highly recommend this place."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2019-09-15,5,Delicious chai latte with oat milk. Would come back again! Great cold brew but expensive for small size.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2019-07-05,5,"This is my favorite coffee shop. No matter where I am am staying in NY, I always make sure to come by here at least once. If you are in Manhattan, this is the perfect everyday stop to get your joe. Joes coffee offers 3rd wave coffee roasts, lattes and the usual small bites as well as some Gluten Free, sugar free and vegan baked goods. They also have seasonal offerings beyond the usual faire that are always delightful. The baristas here are fast and know their coffee."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2019-03-03,5,"Clean caffeine. My standard latte was super smooth and delivered solid non jittery caffeine for hours. 

Husband had a perfectly Instagram-able match oatmilk latte. It was green and tasted like grass. Very healthy."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2019-01-01,3,Good amount of ample seating. Service was good. The baked goods looked good especially the chocolate chip cookies. They also serve water which is nice and definitely needed. The mocha coffee was alright. Found it to be lacking flavor. Espresso seemed burnt and tasted bitter. Located close to Central Park.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-12-14,5,"Best coffee in NYC! I'm so picky with my coffee and their coffee is perfect, strong but still smooth and not bitter. And the staff is so nice and funny! They are always in a good mood. I love coming here every morning! Prices are reasonable as well."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-12-10,4,"Cute shop, friendly staff, tasty drinks -- didn't  try the baked goods (even though they looked delicious)...  What else do you need to know?"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-11-19,4,Found the optimistic reviews here and I didn't regret making time to come here. Had Iced Latte for a break (very solid latte) and people-watching. Nice location-- not too crowded or empty when I came at around 1.30pm.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-08-10,5,Great coffee shop. Favorite in the area. Lattes are bomb and the place has an excellent and friendly staff.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-08-01,4,"I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but on my way to the subway this little coffee shop caught my attention. Or maybe it was the wonderful caffeine aroma. So, I decided to check this place out. 

The shop is small is tiny, but cute and sort of hipster-ish.  It seems like there is always a line.  The baristas were very cordial. I ordered a small latte and within minutes I got my order. I decided to sit in a little corner browsing the internet while I sip my coffee. Like I previously said,  I'm not much of a coffee drinker, so I'm not a coffee expert. But I thought this is a good cup of joe.

4 stars. Very pleasant experience."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-07-27,5,Cool place for a quick coffee and snack in the afternoon. We had avocado toast and a croissant. Not bad at all!
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-06-23,5,"Gotta give props to the barista that actually listens when I say ""no foam please"".  Finally an 'almond milk latte no foam' made just the way I asked, thank you!

Excellent tasting too, got a small and it looked like it came with a double shot, which actually balanced out perfectly with the amount of almond milk they use.

Tasty & made the way you order it! Friendly staff too."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-05-21,4,"I've tried their coffee before but in another location, never got to truly appreciate how good it is. 

Small cozy coffee place. Service is pretty fast, despite the small and limit staff they have. 
First time trying Oat milk, the lady who took my order assure me it will be worth it, and I'm glad by her suggestions and I follow. 

The barista were very friendly and tried to please me as much as he could, giving me an open option to anything else that I wanted if I didn't get to like my coffee, which I thought it was very thoughtful. 

Simply love their coffee."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-04-27,5,"Its a tiny little coffee shop in Manhattan. But quality of coffee is excellent, and its a cozy environment. Definitely a good place to stop by for a cup."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-04-21,5,"This spot has consistently been the best coffee shop on the UES for many years now. There have been many newcomers to the area that are solid but Joe sits at the top even after 7-8 years now. 

I love this space. It's intimate and classy modern. 

The coffee is one of the best anywhere. 

They do tend to have a long line in the morning during rush hour but it moves relatively okay. 

Anywhere on the UES must visit this coffee shop."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-04-18,5,"Always excellent. The baristas are patient and kind, but mostly intelligent about what they do. They have oatmilk (big plus) and delicious pastries from a variety of bakeries in the city.
The prices are reasonable: less than Starbucks, more than your local corner deli, worth it even if they were more expensive.
The seating is kind of limited- 2 actual tables in the back and a large communal table in front. Really a cute shop and worth a visit if you're in the area."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-04-12,4,I work in the neighborhood and appreciate this little slice of downtown on the UES. Mini chain Joe serves up great coffee that's never over roasted or bitter and they have a decent selection of pastries and baked goods on offer from purveyors such as Ovenly - their cardamom cake is unusual and delicious! It's not a huge space but you can almost always grab a seat here and there's even a bench outside. It's a cleanly minimal modern designed cafe and servers are friendly if a little on the slow side. Prices are reasonable and they also  have a loyalty card scheme.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-02-12,3,"Came here on a rainy Saturday afternoon while killing time (was waiting to pick up something from the nearby Apple Store). 

Super cute space. Friendly staff. But I could not believe that the medium cafe mocha I ordered (which didn't actually taste like it had any mocha in it) cost me $5.45!!! 

I mean, I know this is NYC but I eish!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-01-25,5,"Went there during the middle of the day and it spoke to me like a good coffee house should do. Ordered a smoking rich hot chocolate from the friendly barista, had a whole table to myself, popped open a book and lost myself for a bit there. Definitely recommend if you are ever in the area."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-01-20,5,"Beautiful coffee art, nice foam and delicious coffee!! They have a punch card if you visit frequently. Everyone is very nice behind the counter."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2018-01-13,5,Great latte in a communal setting. Small shop but reasonable prices. Sells their coffee as beans too to take away.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-11-21,5,"If you like espresso drinks you can't go wrong at Joe. The get real baristas behind the bar pulling some of the best shots in Manhattan. The beans are excellent and freshly roasted as well. I particularly recommend the Waverly--they call it their ""espresso"" blend but I use it for pour over and it's delicious. You are liable to have a short wait at this location, and there's not much seating area. Also, they pull double ristretto shots, so the espresso is strong! With those expectations you will not be disappointed in Joe."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-10-22,4,The Coffee is good and always fairly priced and the pastry option is usually pretty great. The staff is always friendly and attentive as well. Could do with WiFi (unless I missed them having it) but it's actually nice to sit down and just unplug for a bit over a solid latte. Definitely worth checking out.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-10-06,3,I came here to get coffee after hearing how good this place was. I got an almond milk lattes and wasn't so enthused. The coffee was harsh and almost bitter and not smooth like I like my lattes. It wasn't terrible but it just wasn't for me. The barista and person who took my order were all kind and helpful and lovely.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-09-22,5,"Great coffee, delicious pastries, consistently friendly staff...and zero attitude (unlike those places in the Village).  Love this place!  And they even have a punch card for a free cuppa Joe"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-09-17,5,"The whole place itself has such a nice vibe to it. The lattes are absolutely amazing. I haven't had a chance to try the food yet, but I will definitely be returning. The staff was very friendly as well and overall just a great experience."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-07-27,4,"This place is good, but they need some coffee training. For example their small cappuccino is more like soup. It's HUGE! 

The beans they use are decent. Location is great. Seating area is modern."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-07-23,4,"Great coffee, sometimes somewhat slow service. I personally wouldn't use this as home base to do work due to how small the interior is, but it's a great caffeine pit stop before going to the museums in the area."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-07-19,5,Quintessentially decent coffee. Cappuccino was well made and my espresso was dark and perfectly made served with a shot of soda water. Perfect.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-06-27,5,"Great atmosphere. Great Chai Latte, good customer service, nice clientele and music you can groove to. I'll be back for sure!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-06-09,4,"I've been to several of Joe Coffee establishments and always been fond of their blends. Joe Coffee may be a little bit more than my usual coffee cafe, but I determine their quality by the taste, extraction, and crema when requesting an Americano. It's a simple drink, but you know what taste you're looking for. 

Once my Americano arrived, the crema on top was honey golden and so creamy; I knew this was a good extraction! And it was proven right. Upon my first taste was I impressed with my drink that the espresso did not taste under extracted (bitter) nor over extracted (dead & dirt).

We shared the strawberry sugar morning bun, although I don't think it was worth the price tag of $4.

Nonetheless however, Joe Coffee has a lovely seating in front of window for people watching on Lexington Ave, and just a few streets from The Met Museum x"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-04-28,5,"Every Joe I've been to in NYC and Philly has incredible customer service, and this location was no different. I don't know what it is about their training or hiring, but staff is always incredibly kind, efficient, and seem happy to be there. Product wise, their drip coffee is great, but not super overpriced, which is appreciated when you buy as much coffee as I do. Also had the BLT this morning, which I had never had before. Wasn't ready for it to be pre-packaged, but was happily surprised by it's quality and freshness. With WiFi, this spot would have everything you need."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-04-12,5,"I stopped here for a pick-me-up. I really needed some caffeine and a cookie.

I'm giving 5 stars because the guy behind the counter was SO nice and helpful. His general tone and willingness to answer questions without the hint of annoyance and impatience that you might sometimes get in NYC was refreshing.

I'd been disappointed with the look at desserts in the glass case, because, like I said, I needed a cookie fix, and there wasn't any. They had some DELICIOUS looking donuts, some muffins, and breads. I asked him what the favorite was so he described his top 3. I ended up going with the multigrain banana bread. It was delicious and I didn't regret it since it was seemingly healthy.

He asked what kind of iced coffee I wanted out of the 2 options. I had no idea what he meant by either of them so he went into detail on that too. I made my decision and went to the counter to top it off with Almond milk!.. happy to see that.

Great experience. I didn't do the punch card since I'm not usually in the area, but would be back if I was!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-03-31,4,"When I bought a small coffee for $3 dollars I thought ""Damn this is expensive coffee!"" then I sipped it and thought ""Damn this is good coffee!"" Then I remembered it was $3 and thought ""Damn this is really pricey coffee."" Then I drank it and thought ""It really is good coffee!""

Pros:
+Very good coffee
+ Neat interior
+ Friendly barista

Cons:
-$3 for a small coffee"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-03-15,5,"Good coffee, fast service, and friendly staff. They don't have wifi so no one sits around for hours like in Starbucks."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-03-06,5,"Joes is my go-to in the summer when I'm looking to cool off with a delicious cold brew coffee topped off when cold Almond milk. Their punch card is a great incentive and their donuts are SO DELICIOUS and tempting. There's a lavender one I'm particularly obsessed with and would have every day if it didn't mean more exercise time! 

Very happy to have Joes in the neighborhood-- definitely wins the award for cold brew coffee!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-02-02,5,"I thought New York City was the land of the coffee house, but apparently they're being priced out -- twenty minutes of wandering the neighborhood without even a stinkin' Starbucks to get out of the cold.

Thankfully, I happened upon Joe. What a find -- great people, friendly patrons (not a big place, Joe's coziness encourages you to get to know your table mates) and fine drinks.  

An oasis in the concrete desert -- can't wait to return."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-02-02,4,"Great tiny coffee shop with a small communial table. Coffee is reasonably priced and taste great. Staff is friendly too. The only downfall is that there is no wifi availbe for those looking to get some work done. It seems nice coffee shops with wifi, other than starbucks or think coffee, are hard to come by. My search continues."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2017-01-19,1,"Terrible services, bad actitud,  the coffee is not the best, they ask for the tip in advance but you have to service yourself,  don't ask for to go , I did it and they don't help,  don't have boxes or big bags  for to go. 
I  got my client with the coffee cold.
Disappointed."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-12-09,1,Slowest barista. Took 9 minutes for my late this morning with two people in front. Not exaggerating
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-11-30,4,"Came here to conduct a meeting and the back has seating (front is mostly a large communal table) and it was really nice, not TOO quiet that we felt like we were being disruptive by having a conversation, but not too loud that we couldn't hear each other.

Coffee was great, service is quick, donut was okay (overpriced, but what donut isn't overpriced these days?) - mainly just happy that this place worked out for my meeting! But there's no wifi so I wouldn't come here to study."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-11-15,5,"Every time I go, I stick with the lattes as they are reliably delicious and always beautifully made. Reasonably priced at $4 for a small and $4.50 for a large. Their coffee is a bit too acidic for me. Haven't tried any of their food. This location tends to be a bit crowded but usually you can find a single seat somewhere. Staff are consistently friendly and efficient - especially the lady in the front taking orders! Great spot to get your caffeine fix while people-watching or reading a book on the weekends."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-10-31,5,"one of my favorites: Joe, grumpy, stomptown, culture espresso, nine street esporesso."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-10-30,5,"This cute little coffee shop lies in one of the nicest areas on the upper east side (in my opinion). The atmosphere up here is super chill and you can even sit on the bench outside and have a talk without too much noise around you. Also loved the iced chai latte and chocolate croissant I had here. Their doughnuts looked pretty good, will get one of these next time. Prices are decent for the neighborhood, I paid $6.50 in total."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-10-29,4,The coffee is really good. Tried both a latte and a caffe au lait. The donuts were a nice accompaniment but nothing special. They have a decent amount of seating space inside.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-10-23,1,"My chilled espresso was great, until I found a bobby pin in it. Didn't even get a refund or an apology.  Disgusted and furious"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-10-21,4,"Joe's Coffee is a spacious place for NYC--and that, I mean it's small, but there are seats to get cozy. I almost missed the place walking by ---but I'm blind as the place is painted in a toyish powdered light blue (matching their coffee cups)
I was there Saturday late afternoon (4 PM)

Call me ignorant, but I think the coffee taste and overall experience is similar to blue bottle. The prices are about the same as well.

I ordered ice coffee for $4 and enjoyed it to-go. Walking down a few blocks before I was craving another cup. 

The coffee was smooth and very refreshing against the perfect mid-September weather. Looking forward to drop by in my next trip to New York City."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-10-14,5,"Great  cappuccino $4 for a small. Much better than Starbucks.  If you hate Dunkin as much as I do, you will love this place"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-10-08,3,"The customer behind me order the same thing as I did. They give him the coffee first without paying attention. I tipped $1 cash at the beginning and now I am not feeling happy.  Good coffee, NO WIFI.  3 star over all."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-10-05,4,"The coffee is pretty good. Had a glazed doughnut that was good as well. Somewhat sparsely decorated, kinda spartan and industrial feel. Metal chairs, concrete floors, etc. Service was pleasant and quick. 

Good place to grab and go, not to chill."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-09-09,5,I'm not much of a coffee fan but I'm a huge fan of their pastries. The only drink I've tried once was a hot chocolate and I thought it was pretty bitter unless you added sugar. I personally enjoy the Coconut Creme donuts which have coconut creme filling inside as well as coconut shavings and creme on the outside. They are a bit pricey but I think they're worth the price. I also like their gluten free desserts especially their chocolate cookies.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-09-04,4,Got iced coffee to go. Very good cold brew. The pastries looked cute and good but I didn't get any. Wasn't too busy Sunday at noon.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-07-13,5,"Amazing coffee! It's similar to Blue Bottle coffee that I normally enjoy when I am in San Francisco. The coffee is strong and yet really smooth at the same time with no bitterness afterwards. I sat on the outside bench to enjoy my latte and to people watch since it's a small location and not many seats inside were available. When in NY and in need of a cup of joe, Joe Coffee is where you should go!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-07-05,4,"Great espresso-based drinks, though a bit pricey. We got a small iced latte (large was $5.50 I think?) and a hot drip coffee. I actually preferred the house drip over the specialty drip of the day, since the latter was a bit too citrusy for me. The house drip wasn't bad but will definitely just opt for the espresso-based drinks next time. Also be sure to ask for a punch card!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-06-26,5,"Very very good coffee
High quality espresso 
One of the best in town
Service is a bit slow during sun am rush hour, but overall worth it!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-06-17,5,Excellent coffee on a charmy little place. I had the Americano and a Green Iced Tea and both were great!
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-06-02,1,One of Tues slowest coffee shops in the city. Don't bother to go if you have somewhere to be on time.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-05-30,4,"Got a iced chai and a vegan chocolate chip cookie and my friend got an iced matcha. Here are our impressions:

1. Iced chai was a real winner. Good taste, really could taste cardamom and cinnamon. Got it with almond milk!

2. Skip the chocolate chip cookie. While it was vegan and I was craving something sweet, there were blocks of saltiness on the cookie. Also it was a cakey cookie; not a huge fan. Pretty sure it was confused on whether or not it should be hard or soft.

3. Iced matcha was not the best but definitely refreshing. Completely unsweetened, just how I like it. But it's probably not for everyone! (Doesn't really have that vegetably earthy taste that most matcha things have)"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-05-17,4,"Nice, modern little coffee shop off of Lexington Ave -- been here two times before and the lattes/cappuccinos are consistently smooth. The staff here is also very nice, smiley, and patient.

The food selection here is really good/unique -- the little doughnuts they have here are honestly so good, I have gotten a different one every time and they're all delicious.

They don't have any wifi, which is a bummer, but they do have bathrooms!

It's a chain, so it kind of has that chain-coffee-shop feel to a certain extent, but that's okay because I have enjoyed myself every time I go here. Would definitely recommend to a friend!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-05-14,2,"Limited seating options. No wifi. Maybe it's my own fault for not checking beforehand, but I feel like every coffee shop should have wifi. I generally try to avoid Sbux and opt for smaller, independent coffeeshops, but I should have just opted for Sbux. The coffee was good, though, so I would come back if I'm grabbing something on the go."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-05-10,4,"Great coffee spot for NYC.  They care about their coffee and the tasty deliciousness is smooth, delicate, and fulfilling.  

They do get busy, so better time it right to get a seat or...just take it to go.  Either way you will likely leave happy."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-05-06,5,"Love the coffee here! A great neighborhood spot, though pricey. Want to give a shout out to one of the baristas here. A couple days ago I was enjoying a coffee when a couple came in and opened a huge take out container of Chinese food right at the communal table. The smell was so strong and offensive, people literally started walking out. I discreetly told the barista what was happening, and she handled the situation quickly and with grace, both being respectful toward the offenders and saving all the other customers from this overwhelming stench ruining our experience! Thank you."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-04-28,4,"They accept the Dollop App, code PXWRXP
Redeemed my Dollop app credit for a tasty chocolate truffle cookie from the friendly staffer. Place was oddly overrun strictly with 20-something girls on a weekday afternoon."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-04-17,4,"Great cup of joe for the fussy coffee snob or just ol coffee lover! Pour overs were delicious, macchiatto was balanced and I even got a heart from the barista... ;) but seriously, super place for a great single origin coffee experience!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-04-05,4,"I am a fan bc of the adorable cups and delish cafe au laits... but be warned there is no Wifi! Cute communal table and more seating in the back with outlets, but there is no internet. A biiiiiig bummer when trying to get work done with a nice cup of Joe and scone."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-04-05,3,"Rob Thomas, Train, Dave Mathews Band, 3 Doors Down, Spin Doctors, Maroon 5... One of the worst 20 minutes of music I've ever heard in my life was while I was sitting at Joe last Saturday. Don't know if it was intended to be ironic, as I have noticed a frightening trend of early 2000's alt rock, creeping into uptown coffee shops lately. Either way it soured what should be a pleasant experience of an early afternoon coffee, and I had to leave. I don't know if I should be writing a poor review because of the music being played inside what is otherwise one of the better places for an espresso uptown. But maybe there should be stricter guidelines as far as playlists for coffee houses go, because to me, and I'm sure most people, there is a favorable difference between say smooth jazz, and the band who wrote the lyrics ""My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest"", while you are reflecting over a good cup of coffee."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-03-31,5,"Kind staff, great coffee. Staff was super patient with each customer helping them choose all while the line had grown a good bit. Service was still quick as well. The place is pretty small so I don't expect a roomy spot to sit back. Overall, best coffee in the area."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-02-27,4,"A great, busy coffee shop on the Upper East Side. It can get quite crowded in here, so save a seat if you see one coming in! Friendly service, and I received a picturesque latte. A downside is that there are no plugs if you want to come here with a laptop."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-02-03,4,One of the better coffee shops in the UES. Great place to take your coffee to go - head directly to the park and enjoy. Recommend the espresso based drinks here more. Coffee is ok.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-01-15,5,I'm on a 2 day visit to NY and so far I've been to this coffee shop 3 times. I'm very very passionate about coffee and tasted so many brands but their cappuccino is the best so I ever tasted so far.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2016-01-09,5,"This is my go-to spot because they have great coffee. I'm originally from Seattle and pretty particular on this subject, so I definitely shopped around in this neighborhood before becoming a repeat customer here. Even my mother approves of this place when she comes to visit."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-12-29,4,"Around 12:45 theres not a lot of traffic. Simple coffee and desserts. There a variety of pastries, like granola bar, donuts, and choco dipped macaroons. They do espresso, au lait, and other coffee styles. A little pricey for me regarding the desserts."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-12-21,5,"A pretty standard Manhattan cafe, complete with all the charm and all the nooks and crannies. I am a fan of their caramel steamer, just a thought."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-12-05,1,"Trendy little place with a nice vibe. I ordered a filter coffee, which I guess not that many people do, because it was stale and old, and basically un-drinkable. I had already left and started walking, but after a few tries, it just had to go in the trash. Inexcusable for a coffee joint, imho."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-11-07,5,"This is a very unique place with great coffee. I'd say this is one of the best coffee cups I've had in a long time and this is coming from a coffee expert. Even if you try this place once, you'll be coming back for more."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-11-07,5,"First time at this place we ordered simple decaf cappuccino not expecting much.... The drink we got blew us away, it was outstanding! Milk foam was nice and dense and the flavor was complex."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-10-24,3,"This is a cute independent coffee shop with cute decor and their own beans.  They have a big communal table in the center, and it was pretty full on a Saturday afternoon.  

It seems hard to find good coffee in this area?  My friends all liked their espresso based drinks."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-10-21,4,Stopped here on a snowy day to warm up after strolling Central Park.  Nothing goes better with a snow storm than hot chocolate. My boyfriend and I both ordered hot chocolates to stay. The small coffee shop was crowded (everyone was hiding from the cold just like we were) but we were able to snag a seat after some people finished their coffee and left. We sipped on our hot coco out of the classic white mugs and were instantly warmed. I was thoroughly impressed by the cute design the barista made in the foam at the top of my drink.
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-10-03,5,"Great coffee and great location. 
If your looking for a quick latte or cappuccino this is a great place."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-09-17,4,"The espresso bean used is very good,no hint of bitterness, in fact it might be too smooth and creamy.  Still this is very good.  The gynormous cinnamon roll is fresh.  Snag a stool by the window and watch the world go by..."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-09-15,4,"Good coffee, great people. If you're looking for both of these, this is a perfect spot. If you're looking for a place to post up, do homework, or work, while drinking their amazing beverages, this is not you're place. Limited seating, small space, and no wifi."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-09-03,4,"Solid coffee, cozy atmosphere and nice/small layout. They need a wireless connection, I would go more often."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-09-01,4,"A cool and quite space in Upper East. Espresso is not as perfect as I expected, a bit more sourer than I thought but still good."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-08-28,4,"Nice little diamond on the upper east side. Their coffee is pretty good (better then that Starbuck's stuff). Place is a bit small but cozy. Staff is super friendly and the place is really clean. 

It's a go!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-08-22,3,"Joes coffee seems like a small chain coffee shop around New York.  A slight edge above Starbucks, in my opinion, with a Better Batch brew.  They have espresso drinks too if you are feeling for a cup of latte or Capp.  Good looking pastries including Planet doughnuts!  
Nice and comfy seats and nice workers."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-08-17,3,"Great little coffee spot for working or meeting/ having conversation at the large community table. Very friendly service, strong coffee with a nice selection of pastries/ cookies for those who want to indulge their sweet tooth."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-08-13,2,amazing coffee. Great service. Clean. If it weren't for the fact they didn't have wifi I would be in there everyday. 21st century. :/
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-08-09,4,"Great place! I really like studying by the windows and Upper East Side people watching. Coffee is great too, and servers are so nice. This is definitely my go-to place for hanging out/working in a coffee shop in the Upper East Side!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-08-02,5,I had a small iced latte with almond milk and chocolate croissant. Both were delicious. The latte was particularly bold and thick. Loved it. I wish the chocolate croissant was warm but I guess I could have asked :)
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-07-28,3,"Typical milky coffee on the upper east side. Wasn't bad but wasn't great. There are a few other australian coffee shops down in Greenwich/west village that are much better. 

There are also no light breakfast options which is a little tricky, we ended up having a almond Crossiant and a donut but they weren't great, but good enough. 

The communal table was lovely though."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-07-15,5,"I love this location. I actually really love all of the Joe locations I've been to (which is almost all of them). Their coffee is always AWESOME, and they have an amazing chocolate chip cookie with sea salt on it. KILLER.

The ambience of this place is relaxed, and I love how there is usually a group of people sharing the big middle table, either working or conversing. It's a couple blocks from the 77th St stop on the 6 train, so pretty convenient.

There isn't any wifi, so beware you Internet-seekers!"
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-07-06,5,"Definitely the best spot for coffee on the upper east side. It's a quiet, communal-style, dim little cafe where don't have to worry about the hustle and bustle of say a Starbucks or D&D. Great spot to get work done or to take a date. I have coffee 3-4 times a day, and like to keep it simple with a black, iced-coffee. For this, Joe Coffee is the best. Also, the staff is awesome."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-07-02,5,"5 star coffee (& it's consistent day after day) and not to mention an amazing staff! There's NO other way to start your day than with this ""Cup of Joe"""
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-06-18,1,"While the idea of ""joes"" is nice, the experience is not. The shop  is supposed to invoke a ""local"" coffeeshop experience which I am all about. However no matter how good their coffee is the people that work their must pass a test of how rude they can be, before getting hired.  Eye rolls, sucking of the teeth when asking questions. One time I had a cashier hold a 10 dollar bill to the light as if it was fake. The cold brew is great as is the only reason I kept going but today I had an enough with this pretentious hole in the wall. If you wanna  support local businesses, do it with a company worth your money. If you want a decent coffee with a whole lotta attitude and false pretense, this is your spot."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-06-05,4,"The lack of Wi-Fi is a head-scratcher but good vibes here...the staff has personality which isn't a given in this part of town. Space is tight (as are most coffee shops in Manhattan) but it's a nice place to grab a quick cup and hang for a few minutes if you can. Decent selection, prices are fair..."
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-06-03,4,"Delicious coffee and most of all, friendly staff!! Only unfortunate thing about this cafe is that it has no wifi!! :["
103,joe-coffee-company-new-york-7,2015-06-02,5,Best almond milk latte I've ever had! Line was fairly long with one guy manning all the orders. Wish they had this on the west coast :(
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2019-09-01,3,At this Starbucks because it is close to our hotel. Fairly standard Starbucks experience. Employees werent the nicest but thats probably just a NYC thing
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2019-07-03,1,"My god the music gave me a headache. Had to leave. Went there to get my coffee fix and feel better, but instead i come out with a headache"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2019-05-30,5,"It was soooo busy but service was so good! Whoever was passing out the drinks at the end of the counter was helpful, quick and funny! She really made me smile even before coffee so thank you to this Starbucks team!"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2018-10-28,5,"I visited this location and met Jay, Janice and  store manager Chris. They all made me feel welcomed at this location and provided great customer service. I will definitely come back to this location. I would highly recommend visiting this location when your in the area.


Lorraine"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2018-09-21,3,"Standard Starbucks. Overpriced, oversized, overcaffenated hot and cold beverages for the office worker masses."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2018-07-25,5,"Jackie is the best barista !!! She knows everyone's name goes out of her way to make sure everyone gets what they want.
Thank you for all of your hard work"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2018-06-29,4,"Starbucks is Starbucks, but the MORNING staff here is very friendly. They remember peoples names even though they're always busy. 

I'd recommend doing a mobile order at this location as their in person line moves super slow. 

Not sure why it's such an issue to blend the matcha powder and milk and then pour it over ice, but it always is for the girls who work here in the afternoon. No, I don't want a Frappuccino, I want a matcha latte without clumps of matcha powder so either shake it well or blend it, but don't give me an attitude when I get a cup of milk with green specks slowly floating to the bottom. That's not a matcha latte."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2018-05-08,5,"Even though this location is very busy, the staff is attentive and tries their very best to get you your order in a fast manner. I love coming to this location when I need my afternoon pick me up."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2018-05-01,3,The execution at this location is a bit slower but they haven't messed up an order and they're consistently pleasant.
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2017-12-24,1,I ordered a venti strawberry acia. They proceeded to fill the cup up with a ton of ice!! Very misleading. I will never go here again!
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2017-10-21,1,"I go to thousands of different Starbucks around the country and this by far is the absolute worst!!!!! Ordered two custom drinks and they messed up on both... When questioned if they put certain milks or syrup inside, the girl rolled her eyes.. when we asked to remake it... They took forever and it still came out like shit... They are annoyed as fuck here, not worth a visit, walk to the next Starbucks over..."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2017-09-27,3,"this starbucks on madison ave between 48th and 49th st is hit or miss when it comes to service , some times it's on point and sometimes it's missing in action . it's fairly spacious inside with a few tables scattered around with some window counter seating for hustle and flow watching . nice display of pastries and other food offerings which is easy to see for ordering . i was lucky this morning cause it was not crowded so i was able to order my decaffeinated cappy and egg crossiant in a snap and the dude behind the counter was not overwhelmed so it was a smooth transaction . free wifi and music is played on a low level so if you need to hang a bit to get some work done or if you have time to waste before hitting work in the area . overall 3 stars this visit but it can change on my next one if i am in the area ."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2017-09-07,1,"Ordered a pumpkin spice latte. Employee Janis only filled the cup halfway.  When I brought it back she proceeded to just dump milk in it to the top. I asked for them to make a brand new one, which she agreed to after a hefty amount of eye rolling. It took me over ten minutes to receive a properly made drink (and it wasn't even complicated!  Grande pumpkin spice). Never going back while Rude Janis is on the clock."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2017-07-17,1,they don't fill up the cap. I get only half of the coffee by paying the full cup price
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2017-05-26,4,"Friendly staff and pleasant experience. I placed an order through the Starbucks app ahead of time, so I was able to skip the line and go straight to the pick up area. A staff member immediately greeted me and asked me my name. They confirmed my order and handed over my cup, with a ""Have a great weekend!""  One of my best experiences at a Starbucks during the morning rush!"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2017-04-01,1,Worst service ever. Do yourself a favor and walk 3 blocks to the next one. So unprofessional and rude.
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2017-03-20,3,"I stopped by this Starbucks around 8:30pm. It was not crowded, the reason I stopped by was they close at 10:00pm and I needed a refreshment and also charge my phone. I got a very berry hibiscus. It was ok. The staff looked tired since it was almost end of the day. One lady was trying to put the pastries in the place for next day and didn't care I was waiting someone to take my order. Then a gentleman took my order and take like 2 minutes to do something else then got the money. I read in the other reviews that this is one the busiest Starbucks during the day so I understand they were tired but they should be more careful with the customers."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2016-10-18,3,Great starbucks product but poorly organized barista station. Patrons are directed back to the register area for coffee clogging up the line. Food is on the other side of the store which is means 3 locations and more chaos.
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2016-07-23,1,Really?  One person making drinks?  Line was 15 deep so I mobile ordered.  Mobile ordering said 5-8 minutes. After 15 minutes I got my first 2 drinks. 18 minutes I got two breakfast sandwiches. 20 and I got my shaken tea. I'll walk a little further and find another Starbucks next time in NY.
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2016-07-16,1,Terrible customer service. This cashier had the nastiest attitude with every customer. Gave me my bagel by one side of the store and gave me an attitude when I didn't realize she left my drink at the their side of the store. What about we use common sense and serve everything at one part of the store and not give customers attitudes about it??? Hmmmmm.....
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2016-07-09,1,"Horrible service! We ordered 10 items at 10:05 am this Saturday 7/9, got the 1st 3 at 10:07 am (the shop was almost empty), another 4 at 10:12 am. At 10:20 am, I enquired about the last 3 items (one cookie, one brownie and one muffin so all readily available) and the lady told me to just wait. I waited for another 10 minutes, went back to the cashier who gave me the 3 items without any excuse. These people just don't care about their brand, their company and their clients. A total shame! The manager must do a very bad job!"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2016-01-25,1,Can I give zero stars? Barista was comatose when it came to making coffee or remembering orders or polite service. Did  not know the diff bt  a cap and a latte ; forgot one of our orders entirely ; offered no apology .
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2015-12-29,1,"I've been working in this area for over a year now and I purposely avoid this Starbucks. Most of the employees are unpleasant and incapable of simple tasks such as taking orders promptly or being decent human beings. I've never seen a store manager at this location so I could complain in person so I've resorted to Yelp. Hopefully, Starbucks corporate can fix this issue and make this store what it once was."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2015-12-09,1,"This is the worst starbucks shop I've ever been. Bad costumer service & bad drinks! 

Just walking along madison & saw this starbucks so I decided to grab some drink. When I went in, theirs nobody in the cashier. Theirs 1 guy that just stares at me while I'm walking in so I stood their for a min until I called him & ask if hes the cashier & he didn't answer me, he just walk towards the cash register & another guy came out from the back room & take my order. 

For real I don't understand if this people are really trained to do this kind of job. Where's the costumer service? Its very important. Felt like they hate their job or something. They never smile. Their so busy talking to each other. 

after taking my order I moved to the counter where I can get my drinks & they just put it their without even telling me that thats my drink. I ask them if its my drink and thats how I found out. When I tried my drink Ohhhhh no!!! Tasteless. I always order the same drinks in a different starbucks location & it always taste good. 

Everything in this cafe is bad!!! Avoid this location. Never ever coming back again! I should've buy some $1 coffee from the deli than wasting $4. What a waste!"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2015-07-08,3,It's a Starbucks. Must I say anymore?  It has a taller ceiling than most Starbucks. There were lots of staff so things moved along relatively fast. It's a Starbucks...
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2015-02-27,3,"Hasn't been busy at all when I've gone around 10am. Plenty of seating at tables and windows, ideal for some interesting people-watching. My skinny vanilla latte was done right. Name was spelled wrong as always. Cashier was icy cold to match the wintry New York weather outside."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2015-01-21,1,"This morning I came to get my coffee and breakfast, I come to Starbucks daily. This had to be my worst experience thus far. My order was taken by Alana, who seemed so disgusted and annoyed with being at work. 
I then walked over to wait for my drink, and breakfast. I asked Janis so politely if one of the bags were mine, she looked at me with such a horrible face and didn't even answer me. 
There was a man also making drinks who had white stuff around his lips which I felt was so unsanitary, he was speaking while making drinks so who knows what was flying into the drinks.
I then received my drink which turned out to be the wrong one, I told Sophie that I thought this was not a green tea lemonade, it was just a green tea unsweetened which isn't what I ordered. She began to make me a new green tea lemonade sweetened which is what I ordered and put 8 pumps of sweetener In a grande cup. I didn't even drink it, and I was so mortified by the time I left!"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2014-12-04,3,"Very little place to sit, and the location doesn't help the cause either, because it's always crowded! Service is quick however, and the baristas are friendly. Not enough plug points for charging devices is of course always annoying - but if you have a few minutes to spare you could get a seat by the window which has two plug points next to each other, because customer turnaround is rather quick. No large tables though, so it's an awful place to come for a meeting with more than one laptop."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2014-10-05,4,"Line is always out of the door but for the location it is in, its understandable. OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO BE OUT THE DOOR IF IT'S IN THE MORNING ON A WEEKDAY. At least the line goes by faster than others i have experienced. Always nice staff (well at least to me) and never disappoints whenever I order from them."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2014-06-06,1,"If I could give this location 0 stars I would. I order the easiest drink (unsweetened Ice Coffee) and they botch it every freaking time. Not once, twice, three, four. five but six times in a row and then on the 7th they give me an ice coffee with a chocolate shot. This location needs upper managerial intervention if they would like to grow the business. The only reason I continued to go there is because I work across the street. Save yourself the frustration and go to Au Bon Pain down the street where you can make it yourself for half the price. Bottom Line - STAY AWAY FROM HERE. 

(Unless you like eating breakfast sandwiches with ice in them and drinking another persons drink or nothing at all)"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2014-05-02,1,"Probably the worst service Starbucks in the city.  It's much larger than most so one might think the place can deal with large amounts of patrons efficiently, but no, the establishment is a cappuccino scented morass of inefficiency, a quagmire from which your iced caramel spiced vanilla skinny frappéchino laté and artésan slow roasted low-fat turkey breakfast sandwich will never emerge.  Who created a line in one section of the store, then snakes the line around so it's packed with thirsty and hungry patrons with little time to spare for their break, and then also uses that exact location to not only place orders but also pick up food items?  Also throw in an oversized display case and the newspaper stand to make the area extra tight for good measure.  It just makes no sense and strikes me as patently foolish store design.

To help them out, I've identified two development points for this location, areas of improvement that I've noticed service lacking  over the past few weeks:
1.  They are always out of breakfast sandwiches.  Either every single one of them, as I discovered last Thursday at about 7:45am, or the person in front of you orders the last slow-roasted ham so they're all gone, but the lesser quality ham sandy is still available (today, 34 minutes ago), or they just make you wait ten minutes and in the intervening time all of the sandwiches have been taken by the people ordering on line behind you (last Wednesday, 7:43-7:55am).
2.  They don't tell you when your coffee is ready.  This has only happened twice, so maybe it's not as pervasive as the first issue, but I would think the purpose of asking for your name in a crowded coffee-serving restaurant is to actually use that name on the drink and call said name out when aforementioned drink is ready to be consumed by the beverage consumer previously discussed.  But I don't work in the coffee hospitality biz, so I have no idea what I'm talking about.

I would also like to note that this location is in midtown, and takes way too long to process and deliver orders - if you've been to a location that does it right, like a midtown chipotle at lunch or the Starbucks on 42nd st, placing the order to paying and leaving takes all of three minutes.  The breakfast rush is just as crucial a time - either you have to catch a train somewhere and it's leaving in 5 minutes, or you're on your way to work and needed to be at your desk 10 minutes ago.  In short, everyone's in a rush, and twice this Starbucks location had forgotten an order or delayed for so long I wanted to get behind the counter and craft the thing myself.

Anyway, this place receives positive mentions for the quality of the coffee and food item - it still is a Starbucks after all - and for the size of the store, so one isn't packed into a 30x10 box like most other locations waiting to order or afterwards.

Cheers"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2014-04-02,1,"The cashier makes you feel like it's the end of the world if you don't move fast enough from the ordering line to her register. I'm sluggish in the morning and this is why I'm getting coffee to begin with, so please hold the attitude!"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2014-03-26,3,"Updating my review to a 3 cause when they get it right, they get it RIGHT. They spell my name correctly and the chai latte is banging."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2014-03-15,1,Worst Starbucks I've been to. They mess up your orders and don't even pay attention to what you order. Everything is fast for them.
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2014-03-06,4,"The service here is great, although the location makes this Starbucks full of tourists.  After just going a few times over a month, the baristas remembered my name and my most popular orders.  Much better service than I've seen in other Starbucks!"
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2014-01-05,1,"Thumbs down at this location. I would swear that if the cashier smiled, his face would crack. Even on a Sunday afternoon, not during peak hours, the two men behind the counter were slow and unfriendly. I was not greeted by the cashier and he did not ask me what I had; he just looked at me. I told him what I had, scanned my card, and he stared blankly at me. I looked back and he pointed at my drink in the pile of drinks on the counter. 

I know it is unfair to rate a business solely on its employees, but customer service is imperative to keeping customers! As far as the rest of the place goes: 6 tables, a few window seats, only a few outlets. Low-to-no music, so it might be an okay place to do work. Not good for groups larger than four."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2013-08-23,4,"This is one of the busiest starbucks in midtown, no question. The lines can get really crazy (15+) during peak times, but the staff does a pretty good job at handling the traffic and orders.

I come regularly for quick coffee runs and I do appreciate the service at this location vs. some of the other starbucks or coffee chains in the neighborhood. The staff here are friendly, efficient, move the lines fast and get your orders right! (at least mine)."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2012-07-23,1,"Morning experience that makes me wish I was a secret shopper or worked for Starbucks so I could fire the guy behind the counter with no apron and an untucked shirt - looking a hot mess and not able to handle a simple line of customers!

Stopped in on my way to Spanish class this morning to grab a tall dark roast and a bacon gouda sandwich - my regular, but not my regular Starbucks location.  At this location it took 15 minutes and I was late to class!  

The guy calling out drinks behind the bar took my sandwich order and called out my drink.  Then the girl at the counter asked me what I ordered, put it in the computer, called out my sandwich again and the guy said he had already got it not to worry.  I put some cream in my coffee, came back to the counter as they guys was taking something out of the oven and he went to hand it over to me and said oh wait this is not yours ...... it was for someone that was way behind me in line.

He then said yours is on its way and waited another 2 minutes to put it in the oven.....seriously?  Then the oven went off and he left it in there for another 1-2 minutes (it was way over cooked by the time he took it out)...seriously?  Then he handed it over like nothing ..... terrible service - at least apologize for the wait!  People like this should not be allowed in customer service jobs.....let alone Starbucks where the service is usually excellent.

This guys should be fired....his shirt was completely untucked, not buttoned all the way, no apron and it looked like he wasn't using tongs to put stuff in the oven - what a mess of a person.  To top it off he acted like he was running the place and doing a great job......I sure hope he is not a manager."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2012-04-25,2,"This Starbucks gets it wrong 9 times out of 10.  Several times in a row they've put out the wrong drink and then when I explain what it should be, they pretend to change it and put it back out.  Caramel sauce on a vanilla latte does not a caramel macchiato make.  

This is commonly known to be a crappy location.  You're better off making the trek to 50th and Lex."
104,starbucks-new-york-400,2011-05-13,2,"I can't believe no one's reviewed this one yet.

This location is right next to my office, but I hardly come here unless I need to make a quick run during the day.  The baristas are horribly rude.  Actually, it's one or two of them in particular, but their behavior is enough to make me not want to come back.  They are good with big orders, however.  Guess that comes with the territory of a Starbucks on Madison."
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2019-03-31,5,With midtown having a Starbucks in every block literally. This I can say is the best one at making drinks. Especially the Sunday morning crew. They have a great attitude and customer service.
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2018-06-09,4,"This is such a rough spot. Of course they can get crazy busy because this location is on 6th ave, and it's going to be hard to keep drinks moving quickly when you're a small storefront in front of some HUGE buildings!! I will say it's probably worth it to walk the extra block from Times Square so you're not dealing with all the madness/tourists. This is weirdly specific, but this location does NOT offer the nitro cold brew (i.e. the one that's all foamy), so if you have your heart set on that drink, you will have to walk over to another location.
On the pro side, I often come into this Starbucks to use my free drink rewards, and I go ham when I use those (needing special milk, extra shots thrown in, you name it I've probably asked for it). And they've never gotten it wrong. God bless the baristas who put up with our ridiculous coffee orders!"
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2018-05-21,1,"Quite possibly the worst Starbucks in NYC! No bathroom, completely apathetic staff and filthy tables, floor and bar make for a regrettable experience!"
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2017-12-30,1,"No bathroom.
Wrong address, inaccessible from 6th ave enter on 47th.
Count on Starbucks as reliable place to meet friends and was highly disappointed."
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2017-09-21,5,By far the best Starbucks ever! Maxine is so sweet and so is the Store Manager and all of the staff. They know me by name and I feel at home here everytime. My favorite location forever!
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2017-08-29,5,"Coffee: I ordered my usual (tall vanilla blonde in a grande cup) and it was perfect. I've come here many times and they always do it right. 

Service: The baristas here are always friendly to me. 

Overall experience: Great! It's located in the same building as the NHL store so when I come to meet my husband I always come here. It's never too crowded and I usually get a seat."
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2017-03-31,3,Average. Lines aren't terribly long. Service nothing special. Visited here twice during my stay in NYC.
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2017-03-06,4,"Friendly,small and not crowded. It's around the corner of the NHL reebok store. I thought it was inside of it but is also accessible through the back of the store."
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2017-02-14,5,This is a great Starbucks. The baristas are very nice and they really keep things moving. The only minus: the doors are ridiculously hard to open. But it's worth the effort:)
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2016-08-05,1,"I came in here to kill some time and I thought it'd be great because THE NHL STORE!!! Well aside from the fact that I was in heaven because of all the hockey stuff was in one location, I've never been so annoyed in my life. I ordered a iced white mocha, which really isn't a complicated drink, and I literally waited for about 20 minutes....and then they gave it to the wrong person! She was like this isn't mine and then they remade her a drink as well as mine. now if it was crowded and a more intricate drink I would've understood....but I was one of 4 other customers who all came in after me and left before me. Oh and did I mention that there were 4 people behind the counter and they were all hanging out and talking while I just sat there waiting for my drink. I usually don't right bad reviews but this just pisses me off due to the lack of good customer service."
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2016-07-19,1,"Bad in all aspects. Dirty Starbucks, if you go afternoon they sure run out of sandwiches, bagels and muffins. Just 4 or 5 chairs to have a seat. There's a much better Starbucks one block away"
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2016-06-15,4,"I don't usually review for Starbucks and this is my first time at this location. I was surprised to find guess what?!? Empty seats at Starbucks! I think because the place is next to the NHL store and kinda hard to see. But don't get me wrong people come and go they just don't usually stay and sit like at any other starbucks. 

Though I have to say the staff, there were only 2. One is new I guess that he doesn't know about the drink because I asked about the new double double fudge and he seemed lost. So took one star for that, I think every staff members should know about their products. But the other one is great! She knows exactly what it is and even better there was extra and she gave it to me in a little cup instead of throwing it out! Which is great! Not wasteful! So my friend got a small one too. Lol! 

So if you are in the area and need to just take a break, definitely go to this location."
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2016-05-12,4,"Difficult for me to find the entrance at first, which led me to a short lived desperate frenzy. But you can enter on the street right by the subway (47th St) or thru the NHL store (6th Ave). 

I visited around 6pm and the line waiting for drinks was pretty long (only 1 employee making dranks). And the cashier was busy with a million things - but still took my order in a polited, yet expedited manner. My soy matcha frappacino was a bit watery though. 

Knowing this location is in the cut is good, I walked by nearly 10 times."
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2016-05-09,4,"Does your Starbucks have a hockey theme? The NHL Starbucks has an entrance from in the NHL Store. There's a street entrance too. Comfortable seating in the back or sit by the window. 
Just like the associates in the store the Starbucks employees are friendly and hard at work. 
I just started to come in here. I'm always hanging around the store. 
Not much more to say. It's Starbucks!!"
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2016-01-17,5,Good service. Quick. Drinks were made to order and we had a pretty big order (family of 5). They made the kids drinks with extra whip Which my kids loved!
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2015-12-29,5,"The staff at this Starbucks is very friendly, courteous, and helpful. I was having a tough day, and Eddy instantly brought cheer and a smile to my face with his humor, conversation, and handing me my coffee w/ extra espresso shot in a very prompt manner. Excellent customer service. The brunette lady (sorry, I forget her name!) was also very kind and helpful when I was using my Starbucks app to pay for a drink and I made a mistake in conveying my order. She resolved it right away. I highly recommend this Starbucks location. Very pleasant experience. Keep up the great work!

Thank you,
Jaclyn"
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2014-12-24,4,"The Starbucks is attached to the NHL store, not the NFL store. I found the service to be prompt and helpful and I had no problem getting what I wanted with my order. Just location has seating and is not exactly spacious but does offer a quick break when you are shopping and in need of a beverage."
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2013-10-27,2,"The line and wait for drinks here was atrocious. It is in the NFL store but you need to go around the corner, since they have since blocked it off. It got very crowded waiting for drinks. I would find another starbucks next time"
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2013-10-18,1,Worst Starbucks.  Service is extremely slow. Was completely ignored. Never will I go here again
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2013-06-27,1,Today the store charged my starbucks card for 2 cups of coffee - before they were even open. Someone is a thief.
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2011-02-16,1,"The worst Starbuck's ever.  Does anyone even manage this place?!  The service, especially in the evening, is atrocious, unfriendly and completely unprofessional.  You can look forward to long lines, stale pastries and unfriendly and incompetent baristas.  Have fun."
105,starbucks-new-york-557,2011-02-09,5,"This Starbucks is actually in an NHL store, which is completely absurd and completely awesome. After a well-managed early morning rush, there is never anyone in there. There is a clean bathroom (excellent), and the store boasts the friendliest Starbucks staff in Manhattan. It's a gem. Avoid the other nearby Times Square locations at all costs."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2020-03-16,2,"Usually I don't write reviews but this was ridiculous. I order a caramel Frappuccino every morning with a pump of peppermint without a problem. The one time AMANDA makes it, it becomes a huge ordeal. First I asked if she put peppermint in the drink cause I didn't taste it at all and she said yeah I put one pump. I told her I didn't taste it like I usually do when everyone else makes my drink. So she hands me a small cup with a pump of peppermint. I'm like what should I do with this? I can't mix it into the frappuccino. It's just gonna sit on the top of the drink... She then has the nerve to say I don't know. So I'm still calm and asked if she could just remake the drink. She said it'll take a few minutes so I waited. Then she comes back and said we ran out of coffee. At 6:45 IN THE MORNING. WHEN THEY OPEN AT 6 AM. 

Everyone else in the store is amazing but I've never had to deal with Amanda until today and don't know why she still has a job there. I've seen her treat her coworkers  and other customers so disrespectfully."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2019-12-02,3,"Avoid this place if you're in any sort of hurry...even a slow one. Service craaaaaaaaawls. Seriously, this is the slowest Starbucks I've ever been to and the staff clearly couldn't care less about that. Mobile orders are the worst. What's the point of ordering 10 minutes ahead if I still have to wait another 10 minutes in the store? The most confusing part is that the food is always ready before the drink (and is cold by the time the drink arrives). Every other location I've been to has been the opposite. Also, 4 people behind the counter and only 1 making drinks? Common on, guys."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2019-11-18,2,"The people are so nice but my drinks never taste right. Today was my last day going to this location, I ordered a peppermint hot chocolate and was given what was essentially hot, watery milk. No chocolate, no peppermint. I'm now realizing how dramatic this review is for a Starbucks drink, but I was looking forward to TREATING myself to this beverage. The way they asked me if I wanted whipped cream was so deceiving too, I was let down today."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2019-11-12,1,I hate this Starbucks so much. Today was my third visit here and they are always extremely slow and never get my order right. I repeated my order about 4 times and STILL it was made wrong I just don't understand. They need to retrain these workers because they clearly can't get the ordered correct ever.
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2019-09-25,5,"If you're blessed to have your drink made by Agnes, savor it because she makes the best everything!"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2019-06-25,1,"I usually don't yelp places like Starbucks but I was in a rush with my coffee this morning and just had to yelp this horrible experience. First off I mobile ordered and it said ""2-5 min"" I arrive about 4 minutes later and then waited about another ten in a pretty empty Starbucks, I'd be a bit more understanding if it was packed to the gills in there but it wasn't. 

Along with double the normal time for a drink my drink was made with literally zero effort. I saw the drink and asked the girl making the drink if she was sure that's correct for a cloud caramel macchiato and she goes ""yeah that's how it's supposed to look"" so apparently it's not supposed to look anything like the picture blasted over the counter instead it's supposed to look like I poured my own Folgers I burned at home... with no time to argue over coffee I left took one sip tasted nothing like it and threw it in the trash. By far the worst Starbucks experience I've ever had so bad it forced me to yelp it. Thank you for making my crappy morning worse."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2019-06-24,1,"Worst Starbucks I have ever been to! It is hard to screw up a hot chocolate (or rather any drink because there is a fixed ""recipe"" for each and everything here). The guy making the drinks is probably one of the rudest and definitely does not know what he is doing there. He literally did not put any chocolate or sugar/vanilla syrup in my drink - it was as if I am drinking plain hot milk which obviously is horrendous!  I had already gone out of the store before I started drinking it so could not complain (but I doubt if my doing so would've changed the attitude of the barista).

Note to self: always taste the drink while at Starbucks so you can get another one made instead."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2019-06-13,1,"** GO TO 60th & 3RD AVE **

Inconsistent, Unfriendly, and Classless.

This is by far one of the worst Starbucks I've encountered with the rudest staff. I submitted a Mobile Order and it took almost 30 minutes to get an Iced Chai. This place was utter chaos. Blenders without tops on, frappucinos shooting everywhere (lol) and baristas calling out to patrons as if it were a bar, ""Hey, what did you order? What about you? You?"" Literally making one drink at a time and whoever yelled out their order the loudest was served first. 

The staff is consistently rude and classless. I came in another time to pick up a Mobile Order and as soon as I walked in one of the baristas yelled at me, ""SERVICE ANIMALS ONLY!"" Luckily, I have a service dog but it was embarrassing to say the least. The baristas both kept talking behind the counter about how gross it is to bring dogs into an establishment where there's food. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but at the end of the day, your job is to make drinks and be polite to customers, not give your opinions. 

I've NEVER in all my years of visiting Starbucks have ever been called out for bringing in a dog. If anything, I'm asked if I would like a Puppuccino or baristas simply say I have a cute dog. There's no reason to yell out and embarrass paying customers. 

This place could use a little class, training, and overall etiquette. Go to 60th and 3rd Ave where the baristas are kind, consistent, and have class."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2019-03-23,1,"Unpleasant experience. Made a big fuss about making my cloud drink. I get it it may be more complex to make than a refresher, but you should never complain about making it in front of a customer..do that behind the scenes or something. Ruined the experience for me"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2018-12-10,1,Stop putting people who don't know what they are doing on the register. It's sooo frustrating. Especially in the busy am rush. A y'all extra hot mocha shouldn't be something hard to put in  oh and thanks for overcharging me a buck. Grrrrr
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2018-12-08,3,It's your normal Starbucks but what drives me nuts about this location is the people who will sit for hours and not buy anything. I sit in Starbucks for an hour at most and work and always spend money. I feel like that's just good manners. I wish the staff would enforce this even a little bit. It's a small location and people should NOT use it as their office. It's a coffee shop for Christ's sake
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2018-04-27,1,"Horrible service! the previous staff that was here is gone! They were great they knew your name always tried being quick and attentive now thats not the case.
Ordered a smoothie the girl preparing the drinks got annoyed because she wasn't sure how to make it and had to go out of the her way to do it, had another young man do it because she was annoyed at the process I guess. 20 minutes waiting, then a day ago another 15 min she was making everyone else's drink forgot mine. 25 minutes! Left in the mixer I got it after I  
Was over it and wanted a return. 

Please bring back the nice people we had in this location. 
If someone feels like its a burden to make my drinks I don't want the negative energy sorry won't be back and I was a regular here."

This should not be allowed as they are taking seats that paying customers should have access to. People also come in to use the restroom without purchasing anything as well. Employees should not allow this as space is very limited at this location.

106,starbucks-new-york-329,2016-10-30,1,This location is always a mess. Slow taking orders. Slow making drinks. Even worse when it's busy. Usually feels dirty to me. They either understaffed or need new management. It's just coffee and some minimal food. Shouldn't be this hard.
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2016-10-23,1,"I feel like the quality of workers at Starbucks has taken a severe down turn...everyone always looks miserable.
You would think that this location would purposely make an effort to staff it with professionals...not so.
Today I was handed my pastry with the packaging still on...seriously? You can't take 2 seconds to remove the wrapper? Why?
The barista was angry-not sure over what...but couldn't make the effort to move my beverage a few inches towards me--and for some reason I feel this location attracts really creepy patrons...just a really awkward vibe to be around."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2016-09-10,1,This Starbucks continues to allow non service dogs into their store. It's disgusting. I do not want a dog near the counters where there is food! Licking the chairs and tables! Near the milk bar.  I've complained and still nothing has been done. If you don't want to leave your dog outside then leave your dog at home!!!!!
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2016-07-08,2,"It's VERY TINY.  Came to meet a friend.  They do have outlets if you can get to them but this is not one of those locations that's comfortable to hang out in for an extended time period.  I like that it's near Bed, Bath & Beyond and the Food Emporium but if you were looking to hang out or relax, this really isn't the location for that."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2016-05-28,4,"They recently modernized this location -  which is always busy with Bed, Bath & Beyond &TJMaxx shoppers as the stores are nearby.  

However, if you can't find a seat inside, no worries as there are plenty outside, with trees providing welcome shade in the hot summer sun.

The drinks here are always consistently mixed to perfection by the seasoned baristas. 

Today's special promotion: Download the Starbucks' app for a FREE Frappuccino. I did and enjoying a Venti-sized S'mores Frapp as I write this review!"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2016-05-23,2,"This location is tiny, cramped and generally unpleasant. There always seems to be a line, even in the middle of the afternoon. If you want the use the bathroom, you have to squeeze past the line, go up to the counter, request the door code, and then squeeze back past the line and people coming in through the door to get to the corner. 

There are seats outside (no tables) on the sidewalk plaza, but it's a busy corner and not an especially enjoyable place to sit. 
 
There aren't a ton of coffee shops within a few blocks of here, but don't bother with this Starbucks, even if you have a gift card you're itching to spend."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2016-02-27,3,"I went into this Upper East Side Starbucks just to charge my camera batteries (I had just had a coffee at Joe's down the street, but they ended up having no plugs at all). You will fight to find seating here! It is limited and quite tight. The workers seemed stressed, though of course this is to be expected in such a busy location! The girl sitting next to me, a tall beauty with long golden hair, had ""Serena"" written on her cup. Was that really her name...?"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2016-02-04,4,"i am in a starbucks zone or mood meaning i will visit a bunch of starbucks around the metro area semi non stop and then give it a rest for a while. this sbucks location is 1st ave between 61st and 60th st upper east side near the 59th st bridge. it's a smaller spot but as long as i am able to find a seat for my butt then it's big enough of a place. a few comfy    chairs and tables with counter by the window seating for us daydreamers . the typical hot and cold beverages  with bagels, pound cakes, cookies, muffins, scones, breakfast and lunch sandwiches, yogurt and boulange food products that i am trying for the first time. the folks who work here are not that talkative but that's ok cause i need a cold caramel frappe with a chicken santa fe panini and if no one is watching a egg salad sandwich as well (who cares if stangers watch me eat two sandwiches ). the place is kept clean and organized and all the treats are display in plain easy view. the free wifi and charging station on tables ain't bad either. overall a decent starbucks which served a purpose while i am waiting for my niece who is nearby ."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2016-01-03,4,"Fine; small location.  The staff did start mopping, etc. well in advance of the closing time.  That didn't bother me; I'd want to go home, too."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-11-30,1,"I've been coming here almost every day since I started working in the neighborhood and the service is consistently terrible. Invariably there will be five or six members of staff faffing around behind the counter while there is a line of people waiting out the door to both order and pick up drinks. There is usually one frazzled person taking orders while other staff members chat and have fun, which is infuriating when you've been waiting five minutes for an unheated something or other and a plain coffee. I know, first world problems, but this store really doesn't have the efficiency and customer service that you find at other Starbucks."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-11-12,5,"Great staff; it's nice to see familiar faces. Helpful staff too. Today is the first day of a promotional special for the hot winter holiday drinks--TODAY, BUY ONE GET ONE FREE!! Yipee. I'm enjoying a hot, tall, pumpkin spice latte AND a hot, tall Creme Brûlée latte. 

Last year, during similar promotion, I would usually give my free one to a (thrilled) co-worker. Today, I've got the day off & it's a cold & damp, gray day so I am enjoying both! Thanks SBUX.  I do enjoy the breakfast & lunch/dinner sandwiches often. Fresh flash frozen, nice calorie count & healthy ingredients on the breakfast sandwiches...yes, I said healthy."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-10-05,4,"This location is a bit out of the way but I like it a lot because the lines seem to move very quickly compared to other locations in the neighborhood. Whenever I place an order, I get the correct order and almost immediately. 

My only gripes that prevent me from giving it 5 stars are 2 things:

1- whenever I ask for light ice, I still get a lot of ice, usually around 1/4 the cup even when I emphasize the light ice by saying ""light ice, as in really light, as in 8 ice cubes light""

2- the milk station rarely has heavy cream and usually you see a lot of spilled drinks all over the station"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-08-22,1,"I came here after getting goodies from the ""World Market"" Never again will I come back, I came here to purchase a Passion Fruit Tea, it was so bitter I couldn't even drink it. (It was sweetened) I exchanged for another, I ended up getting my money back as they tasted the same. Now, I recently came back after my terrible experience. I foolishly ordered the same drink, bitter. After coming back for a refund the barista was pushing me to purchase a new one, there was no way in hell that'd happen. I walked past the overflowed garbage can and the screaming children and left. I reccomend you come here for coffee and sweets, not the tea!"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-07-27,5,"Julie was helping my dad and I get our espresso this morning. She was so incredibly nice, she was quick and saved us money, was friendly and just made us glad to be in New York at her Starbucks. I downloaded this app specifically to write a review about her."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-07-16,3,"The employees seem nice enough and the outdoor setting is especially nice on a warm day like today, but with every seat full I just could not relax comfortably like many other starbucks in the Upper East side. My Frappuccino was also quite sweet for my liking so I would recommend getting something less sweet at this location."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-06-27,3,"The service was fine, and the drinks standard, but man, do they jack up the A/C! Maybe it's a strategy to get people not to work in the cafe. I can understand why, because it's a small location, so there aren't really any seats for customers if everyone's working. I would come here to pick up your coffee, not to work!"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-06-16,5,"As I travel around the city for work and pleasure I visit a lot of Starbucks. Until recently, at the SB on First Ave and 60th St I had not had very good service and the place looked unkept and sometimes had some unidentified unpleasant odor(s). In the past few months I was made aware that a new manager named: Laney (?) Alfaro had stepped in and truly revamped the store into a SB that I now look forward to visiting rather than finding another one nearby but kinda out of my way. The store looks clean--almost like it was repainted and the staff just seem so much more professional, friendly and like they are genuinely interested in getting my beverage made as I had ordered it. Thank you Starbucks for sending this new manager and maybe new staff (?) into this location. I had recently wondered if they might have been seeking to close it down completely So glad you chose to upgrade. And thank you to all the staff at that location as seeing a friendly face at any time of the day can really turn a persons day around for the positive."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-06-07,4,"Good service, at this location. Staff here is super nice. Place is always hustling. Fully equipped concession stand with the different types of Sugars and Milk. 

I guess it varies from place to place but in many Starbucks, I may find Vanilla Powder or Cocoa Powder- or may not. I think it's the extra touch that some Starbucks take into consideration. 

I really like the attention here- a little slow- but nonetheless, ok"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-05-19,4,"...I don't take advantage of this Starbucks NEARLY enough. It's a nice switch from the usual morning (...and afternoon, and post-work...) cacophony that comes from the Starbucks I usually frequent on 69th & 1st on my Upper East Side work days. I normally take the M31 bus crosstown and up York Avenue to get to my office, but on nicer days (or rainier days in which I'll hop on whichever bus comes to my stop first!) the M57 will drop of you off at its last stop, 1st and 60th, and pretty much right at their front door. It's a rather nice detour to my office. It's clean, the staff is kind, and it's not crowded! *insert double high five Emoji here* I praise this location for being a hair off of the beaten path, at least when it comes to your average NYC morning commute. You're in, you're out, and your happy with your beverage or food. Perfect!"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-03-18,4,"Went on a weeknight around 8pm. Very friendly staff. It's at a good location. Only drawback is there is no real ""private"" space since it's small and has windows all around."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2015-01-13,3,"EDIT: I'm updating this review after about a year. It seems they've hired some better staff that do a better job. You can read my review below of some of the old staff members who were screaming at customers trying to use their bathroom (which they'd lock hours early, etc). Now I'd say this is a decent place for sure. Some barista's are really awesome, and some get confused easily by your basic order (hopefully they are just new), but it's overall a basic Starbucks location now, and not horrific like it used to be. So I will prob start coming here again. 

MY OLD REVIEW: 
I think this establishment has the worst customer service, repeatedly, I've seen in any place of business, ever. Sure, everyone has a bad day, but I've come here when I need to finish work for over 3 years, and it hasn't improved. I don't think they have management here? 

I don't expect Starbucks to be friendly, or even tactful, but I do expect them to keep the store open for the posted hours, to not spray cleansers near (or onto) customers, as they clean up hours before closing, mopping and spraying as if they customers weren't there, and closing the restrooms 2-hours before closing the store, denying all the customers coming in access to the restroom (several times I've seen yelling fights between one worker in particular and customers, saying ""I need to go home early, so I don't care if you have to use the restroom."" Tonight an older man (after he was getting no where with the worker) said he would be calling his lawyer and would begin a personal law suit against the worker -- who knows if he's actually going to, but I kinda hope that wasn't an empty threat. These people deserve to be sued, seriously. This is not the first time I've seen customers yelling back at the workers, who are some of the most selfish I've ever seen. 

I've emailed Starbucks about this, but they just write one of those standard replies and nothing improves.

So I really encourage anyone in the area to go anywhere else. The only reason to go here is it's open until 10:30, where as other cafes are closed at 9. However, since their goal is to make customers uncomfortable enough to leave, is effectively closed at 9. 

I had brought my laptop to finish some work, but ended up leaving after 5 minutes because the mood was so hostile, with the yelling, and the workers trying to get people to leave so they could close the store early.

Better places to spend your time/not have the life sucked out of you

*There is a Teavana (open until 9) close by at 64th and Lexinton. Nice atmosphere and good for work. Lots of outlets. 
*Starbucks at 63rd and Lex -- OPEN UNTIL 11PM :) better atmosphere, better customers service. The two cushy window seats are comfy!
*Starbucks (58-59 and lex) 731 Lexington Ave, seating for work. Bathrooms open. Open until 9. 
*Capital one cafe, 968 3rd Ave -- great, extremely friendly service (they know practically everyone in line by name), bathroom always clean and open, two levels of seating. Very cheap drinks. Only open until 6pm. 
*Alice's Tea Cup (nice ambiance and scones), 156 E 64th St. More of a sit-down place, not good for work, but perfect for tea and conversation."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2014-12-07,5,I would've never thought to leave a review for starbucks but the staff here is amazing and extremely friendly!  Of course the drinks are amazing too!
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2014-09-27,2,"Typical Starbucks...average coffee and pastries however the people who work here (the late shift/ closing shift) are obnoxious and rude. They played their own personal playlists consisting of rap music and very non-coffee shop like tunes throughout the entire shop. I came here to do late night studying but left after 15 minutes because I literally couldn't concentrate. The employees locked the bathroom an 1hr and 15 before closing, so no one could use the bathroom and they were extremely rude to paying customers who requested to use the restroom.  Horrible service not returning"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2014-07-30,5,"Love the night staff!  Super chill and full of conversations.. The perfect side for a late night cup of joe (aka my daily grande Caramel Frappuccino with Cinnamon)  So much personality, LOVE IT! 

Extra..
You are just a couple footsteps away from the beautiful scenery of the Queensboro bridge and the waters below.. Recommended if you rather enjoy some ""me"" time"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2014-06-20,5,"With all the Starbucks Globally - this is my favorite one & that is because this location has the nicest & polite staff. Such a great gang of people in there, they always make getting my daily coffee a lovely experience - Great way to start the day!"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2013-05-08,4,had a coffee with a bagel this is a small location not much seating and its usually crowded but they have great customer service here!
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2012-12-05,4,"What's there to say about Starbucks? Good coffee, 12 days of Christmas soundtrack seemingly on repeat."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2012-08-12,5,"Great customer service from the great staff here, wifi is inside and outside on the benches.

Make your drink pretty fast.   The seating is good, a nice space, pretty calm and quiet normally.  Lines can get absurd in the evenings."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2012-07-17,5,"The staff is DA BEST! 

They actually say hello, and get your order right!"
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2012-06-20,3,"From a bottle-of-water-buying-perspective, this place is top notch!  I purchased a bottle of Pellegrino and the cashier only rolled her eyes once.  The transaction was efficient, and the water was cool and bubbly.  Definitely three stars!

From an ""it's fun laugh at others"" perspective, it  is fun to sit on the benches outside the store and watch how many people try to pull the door open when they are exiting.  I'd say a good 10-15% try that and the look of frustration on their faces is priceless!   It's also fun to see their faces turn red when you point at them, laughing, and shout ""You're supposed to push, Einstein!"".    That would almost be worth five stars alone."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2012-04-05,1,"Wake up, b*tches! WAKE UP! You're a barista at Starbucks. Why are you sleepy at 0630? You represent coffee/caffeine/wakefulness, right? I know its early. I know you don't want to be here. Neither do I, especially after last night. But you're here, and so am I. We will get through this day together if you would wake up and serve me a good cup of coffee. 

I ordered a grande Pike's Place. The coffee tasted watered down and old. No amount of sugar or milk would salvage it. Oh, well. Like the jingle goes...The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2012-02-28,4,"Whenever I'm in the neighborhood at my in-laws, we stop here either before or after we visit. It's a small branch that moves relatively quickly. Always friendly service but don't bother to try and get a seat inside. It is almost always filled with neighborhood patrons or tourists. But there are always the seats outside and plenty of cute dogs to look at while waiting for their owners. You are also bound to find a spot for the car to stand at since people are always bustling in and out of the neighborhood esp. at the Bed Bath next door."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2011-03-07,3,"Coffee good, shotty service.

The Batista is taking orders 3 or 4 deep in the line and the cashier is struggling to swipe a starbucks card.  I think we need to run both registers and maybe service with a smile and we'd be good to go.  

How could it be any different than all of the others."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2010-01-17,3,"I met someone there twice/week - in the late afternoon, on weekdays - for about 1 1/2 years, until mid-2010 (I'm updating this review to reflect the dates).  The service was speedy, so no complaints in that regard - but the people working there were a real ""hit or miss"".  For example, there were times when I told them there was no toilet paper in the bathroom and they practically ignored me.  They also became more lax about cleaning the sugar/milk counter and emptying the trash from it.  On the other hand, most of them were pleasant - and even though it's a rather small place, we seldom had to wait for a table.

A nice aspect is the profusion of outdoor seating, which is a real plus during good weather (although the traffic noise can be a bit much)."
106,starbucks-new-york-329,2007-07-17,4,"Okay it's pretty much like any other Starbucks except for two defining features.

1.  Outdoor seating on benches.  Sure you might sit across from a homeless person but it's still outdoor seating!

2.  The crazy foam lady.  If you've been to this Starbucks often you've seen her.  She comes in, requests large cups of steamed foamed skim milk and then shovels it in frantically.  I can't decide if she has a psychiatric disorder or an eating disorder (or both).  Regardless, she makes this Starbucks just a little bit more interesting."
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2017-09-05,4,"Mmmm one of my fav places to purchase tea. Can't go wrong with any of them. My fav is the detox with hints of grapefruit. It is expensive but worth it. I enjoy the tins the most, but also have bought bags for tea on the fly! Can't wait to have more!"
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2017-07-20,5,Came here to check the tea collections and they taste fresh. Chris helped me and was very patient and attentive and provided an incredible customer service beyond expected.
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2017-05-03,5,"I've been hooked on this brand ever since I discovered it--by accident while on the Champs Elysees.  I picked up some of the decaf earl grey for my mom and it was a hit--then back stateside it was impossible to find.  While they closed their UES location, I've been a frequent visitor to the bowels of the Plaza Hotel and their Food Hall.  On a recent visit I was rushing, trying to shoehorn the errand in between work and an evening event and was admittedly flustered.  A promotion I received was only online but MAYA, who was present calmed me down and made sure I left happy.  She was an excellent, working quickly with grace and aplomb.  Three Cheers!"
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2017-04-29,4,I was first introduced to Kusmi when he bought me a large tin of the loose yellow BB detox.  It lasted a long time.  Now that drink black tea instead of coffee half the time in the mornings I was curious about their Russian line of black teas.  Recently purchased their loose Polish Earl Grey.  Will give it a try.  Also interested in their Troika and King Vladimir.
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2017-01-19,4,"I love their BB Detox and their new pineapple flavored detox tea (in the Turquoise blue box).  These are great quality blended tea bags, probably one of my favorite.  You can also get free samples of the BB detox teas at this location, probably because they are the most tasty!"
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2016-10-16,1,The lady that helps you at the front is super nice. The manager is NOT. Don't come here for the yelp offer of free kusmi tea - they will NOT honor the offer!!! SCAM!!!
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2016-08-01,1,"I called them to know the availability of a product. They said I can come pick it up and even would match the website sale price!
I was an hour away so I called to make sure! I talked with the manager!!!

I arrived there and actually the manager was so desparate for business that he lied... They had neither of the two product I was looking for but they tried to sell me soenthing else!!! 

Trust me when you take an hour out of a busy day to pick a specific item you are NOT I to being sold something else!

Bad experience! I ll never go back or even call them actually cause it s useless! 

Chelsea pear had a better select of tea and infusion. The only thing extra here is packaging. I don't need a fancy box. 

Thanks and bye!"
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2016-07-02,1,Awful experience - they actually declined a promo by Yelp stating they don't participate in Yelp despite they ARE clearly on Yelp!!!
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2016-05-22,4,"We were wandering through the vendor court under the Plaza when we caught the unmistakable aromas of loose leaf tea...we followed our noses to this attractive, brightly lit little shop and were soon smell-testing the varieties of tea offered by this label. Kusmi offers many different varieties of teas, but not so many that you feel overwhelmed. And they come in attractive, colorful tins, giving the shop a feel of opulence, like a boutique.

I got a tin of the ""Anastasia,"" a dark Earl Grey blend with just the tiniest hint of citrus...it's as if the tea-makers sensuously whispered ""orangggggge...lemonnnnnn..."" over the tea leaves, so subtle and lovely. It is phenomenal, and you can easily get two good steeps from a tablespoon or so of tea. GF got a tin of excellent jasmine green. I would definitely get more of this once I've worked my way through this batch.

Customer service was a bit spotty...the salesperson seems capable of excellent and attentive service to one person at a time, but if you're not that one person, you're going to have to wait. We had to stand at the register waiting for her while she answered the phone and worked with a slow-moving customer who was asking cement-headed questions along the lines of ""Now, how would I make iced tea with this?"" Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. And I'm glad I didn't ask about the Yelp check-in offer after reading some of the other reviews."
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2016-01-22,5,"Delightful through & through.

We happened upon this pretty little tea shop on my birthday, and were anxious to choose a small but delightful gift as a remembrance. The shop assistant who greeted us with cardamon tea and subsequently helped us choose the perfect gift could not have been more lovely or professional. Her service was impeccable and she was a true touch of class and made the entire experience just perfect. 

When I inquired about an additional item that was not available for purchase, she was extremely deferential and gracious...and then she absolutely made my birthday by the incredible gift she gave me. I won't say what it was here, in order to protect her anonymity, but she brought me to tears with her generosity and thoughtfulness. Thank you again. Truly lovely..."
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2016-01-08,2,"Yelp says that they offer a complimentary mini tin of tea. When I asked about it, the lady was so incredibly rude, saying that there is no way they can honor the coupon. Then why is it on here! I checked in and everything! Not sure if this is the fault of Yelp or Kusmi, but it was frustrating and hope it can be rectified soon. 

Also, this comes up as a cafe under ""Coffee & Tea""..it's not! It's just an overpriced tea store, don't be fooled."
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2015-10-30,4,Nice place . I bought a friend a gift box of teas . I have only tried in store tea sample and it was tasty .
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2015-10-29,4,Great service. They no longer honor the check-in offer for the mini tin. You must purchase over $50 to receive the complimentary mini tin. Bummer
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2015-07-09,5,"Convenietly located, Plaza Hall Kusmi Tea Store: offers a wide variety of tea assortments. Yet, thanks to simplified tea offerings, you can easily figure out what you want without the help of sale associate. I recently bought a great ice tea jug. Quality of the products certainly justifies the prices.Highly recommended!"
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2015-06-26,4,I've had several of their teas. I cannot attest to the effectiveness of its purpose but everything I've had was simply delicious.
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2013-01-05,4,"This small shop next to the beautifully displayed of mille-crepes cakes by Lady M was easier to find, the large wall full of the brightly Russian colors of Kusmi tea photo and the popped colors were cutely loud.

I bought their green tea pack to try. I enjoyed all of them since I like most any teas but what shined the most was the taste of peacefulness of Ginger Lemon Green Tea. I can definitely pick up on the lemon scent and then ginger. Fresh green taste was not overpowering and I think it works wonderfully as hot or cold in hot summer days."
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2012-11-05,5,Gorgeous teas packaged in gorgeous tins!   I bought the Russian black tea set so I can try multiple teas and loved them all.  Also would make stellar gifts.
107,kusmi-tea-new-york-2,2012-08-18,5,"Adorable shop in the Plaza! Kusmi Tea's main store is on 3rd Avenue, but having another store in Midtown is very convenient. Their tea is superb, and  their variety is endless. The tea sets make excellent gifts, too. I highly recommend Kusmi Tea - it's the perfect store for both first-timers and connoisseurs. It will not disappoint!"
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2020-02-14,5,"I'm going to sound crazy here - but I don't care. Today is Valentine's day, and so I treated myself to my new favorite latte (coconut milk latte). This latte comes with cascara topping, and I usually get extra!  Today, I ordered this drink at the 42nd and Park location... they were out of ALL toppings and it was too busy for me to even begin to think about ordering something different. 

SO, I ran over to this location (which is actually more convenient since I work in the Helmsley building), and asked them if they had the topping. Even though it was slam packed in there, they went into the back and got it for and added it to my latte without one complaint or weird look. 

I couldn't believe how helpful and non-judgmental they were about it.

Thank you guys. Happy Valentine's Day"
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2019-10-04,3,"Very tiny Starbucks with classic aspects, directly across from Grand Central station. My drink was great but the music with curse words playing loudly while I waited was a disappointment"
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2019-03-29,3,"I am a big Starbucks lover, don't get me wrong - but this location is one of the worst I have been to. I come here a few times a week only because it is conveniently located in the building I work in, but that is the only reason. This is one of the smallest Starbucks I have ever been in, and the layout is awful. The door opens super awkwardly and you're like in the way of everyone, there is truly no where to stand. It is right across from the Met Life Building and Grand Central, so I understand how busy it can get in the morning, and I understand if it takes a while. That is why I normally go a little past rush hour. But I was there just the other day around 3 pm and there were only about 4 other people in the store and they still took SO long. The barista seemed like had no clue what he was doing, he made up his own terms for the drinks and moved so so slow, it was painful. I hate when there is no hustle, like come on, people have jobs to get back to and places to be.

One thing I will say I do like is their mobile ordering. Any time I order ahead, my order is always ready when I arrive, so I try to do that as much as possible.

Despite the long wait, my food/drinks always do come out good!"
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2019-01-29,4,"Very busy and relaxing place! Fast and efficient baristas, reasonable price of their food and beverages"
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2019-01-02,4,"Might be the smallest Starbucks I've visited. During peak hours you can barely get inside because the door will swing into people in line. Even when I try to mobile order to save time it is often so packed I have to wiggle my way through. While the interior configuration is cramped, the staff more than makes up for it. I've been many times now and they always greet me with a smile and great attitude. They also are pretty efficient in getting my order to me as soon as possible."
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2018-10-29,3,"Typical. Very busy on a Monday morning at 7:45am. Ordered a soy cappuccino and plain croissant, which were both ready fairly quickly considering there were upwards of 20 people in the shop at this time. Bonus points for pronouncing my name correctly. Thank you, Mr. Barista!"
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2018-06-07,5,"No need to review the coffee/food because with Starbucks you know what you're going to get. This review is for the staff at this location. The staff here are working VERY hard in a very cramped and busy space but manage to stay professional and positive. Even though my order took a little longer than I might have expected, they kept me updated so it wasn't a problem. I'm also impressed with the teamwork of the different staff members who stepped in to help wherever was needed."
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2018-03-20,2,"My drinks are always being made wrong here! If you ruin the way I asked for my coffee, you just ruined my day. We should be getting what we pay for. I always go here because it's right in front of my job. Today I asked for a Coconut milk Mocha Macchiato, it looked like an iced coffee with a whole bunch of mocha at the bottom. A macchiato should be handed to you the way it's suppose to look. No one here puts the effort to make the drink nicely the way it should be or sometimes they don't even fill the cup."
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2018-03-20,1,"This has to be the worst Starbucks ever. I've come in here several times and they never -ever have what i want. I usually wait in line which can be a bit long as this location is kinda small, get to the front order a breakfast sandwich just to hear were out. I stopped going for a while, this morning i was really hungry, i go in this time while waiting in line i ask first do you have the bacon breakfast sandwich left, i was informed yes we do. I waited and pnce at the register she said this is the last one. Fine, i paid and proceeded to wait, then i hear wait someone else order one also. Im sorry ma'am we need to refund you b/c someone else asked first. Why isn't this starbucks fully stocked. Not once have i gone in and left with something/anything I've wanted. The staff was very accommodating but there needs to  be a better system for if aomething is out you are not just waiting in line a long line just to be told they're out."
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2017-12-15,2,This is probably would be one of the worst experience. Buying a lunch sandwich box in lunch time when it was a long line to pay. The cashier guy is working hard to take order and payment. However his co workers was so lazy and keep playing her phone instead of helping him. And she was ignoring people and just pretending she did not see any people. Which is very annoying and unwelcoming. Sigh . What's wrong with Starbucks.
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2017-09-13,5,"The space in this Starbucks is lacking, but if you've visited a Starbucks location outside of New York City, you'll appreciate how fast this team is hustling during the morning rush. I was in a line of more than 10 people and out with my coffee in less than 5 minutes. 5 stars."
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2017-04-16,1,This is the understaffed Starbucks ever. Unresponsive to requests to turn down music. It is blasting in the seating area. The staff is just coping with an impossible situation for them. They are fine. Pretty seating area though. Such a shame.
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2016-07-14,1,I sent my tech to this Starbucks for a iced green tea latte Unsweetened. The first time I got a iced green tea and the second time I got my latte and it's so sweet I had to throw it out ! Seriously ! I wrote down my order on a piece of paper ! Is it so hard to get it right ! Never going to that location again.
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2014-12-30,1,This used to be my first stop in the morning but ever since a shift change a few months ago this place has really gone down hill.  Service is super slow and the staff do not seem concerned about customer service.  I would suggest heading over to the Lexington ave Starbucks if possible and save yourself the headache.
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2014-07-18,2,"Stopped by again... $1 banana and a trenta iced tea. It took quite a while for the tea, and then they completely ignored my instruction on the sweet level (none became very).

Ah, well. Not surprised in the least."
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2014-06-06,3,"Starbucks, ubiquitous caffeine supplier to the masses. This particular location is on 45th St in the Helmsley Building (behind the MetLife Building). It sits between the east and west walks through the building. The space is tiny, but manages to still draw huge lines of disgruntled cubicle drones during rush hours. The customers here are particularly devoid of smiles and patience, maybe from long commutes on the LIRR or that they had to wait on the line as it stretched down the sidewalk outside in the snow/rain/heat/humidity. The staff try to make the most of the tiny space, and while not particularly cheerful or enthusiastic, the staff have not yet messed up my order. 

There are NO SEATS and NO BATHROOMS at this location. You're better off using the public space in Grand Central for that. Or maybe go to Macchiatto or Gregory's. Three stars for doing the coffee right, but no points for ambiance/comfort."
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2014-02-25,2,"During peak hours, this place is the Lincoln Tunnel.  

It's too small to accommodate the morning rush, so lines end up spilling outside. Just like the Lincoln Tunnel. The bar gets bum rushed with people waiting for their drinks so getting to the condiment station, or even back outside always involves trampling over people.

People who are not regulars there get confused slow everyone down. Just like the Lincoln Tunnel. 
Confused people that don't know where to order, pay, and pick up. 

At any one given time, there are only two operational baristas. Just like the tubes in the Lincoln Tunnel.
Because the place is too tiny, adding a third barista would cram them in and there is not enough room for equipment that a third barista can really operate. 

During the rush hour, expect to spend at least 10-15 minutes waiting for your drink. 

Also, the pastries suck. I appreciate the offer to warm them, but they are tiny and are not worth the $, when you can just go up a block and get a huge ass pastry for $1.25 from the nice coffee cart man. 

Yet, at least once a week, I visit this godawful Starsucks. What is wrong with me?"
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2012-07-12,1,"Slowest service I have ever experienced for a Starbucks. The girl making the drinks at was quite rude to the customers, especially as they voiced their displeasure with the inordinate wait and snaking line spilling out into the street. She seemed more focused/concerned on avoiding the intermittent tickled attacks by a gregarious male co-worker than getting through the overflowing drink orders. I would not come back here again. 

Ps & nb: in all fairness to this location: I think part of problem, attitude aside, is they are just too busy in relation to the small size of store and staff (they are pulling a lot of customers from the contiguous office high rise) and need a proper ratio of workers to anticipated customers."
108,starbucks-new-york-239,2011-04-09,4,Small but good. Gets pretty busy at times with all the locals working nearby. Just went through a renovation. Looks very nice. No seating though. Just buy and go.
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2020-06-25,1,Absolutely horrible! I never felt so much anxiety in my life. Customers being served without a mask and there were too many people inside.
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2020-02-16,3,"Waited 35 minutes at 4am when the only 2 people in front of me wanted black coffees. They also couldn't find how to charge me for an English muffin so they charged me for a bagel, which I was fine with but perhaps the system or training program needs to be enhanced. I am baffled by how 2 full time employees can take so long. However they did get my order right, which I can't say for other Dunkin locations in nyc. And the food was good."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2020-01-03,5,"I live on the West Coast my boyfriend lives here and just a few steps away from this Dunkin!
Needless to say this is my go to coffee shop for caffeine anything warm!
I love this place I love the people that work here I think they're fantastic they work really hard sometimes this place gets really busy and they get stuff out as soon as they possibly can!
So people just be kind to one another have a little bit of patience and this place is the best coffee place in the city!"
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2019-09-03,1,"To bad you can't give 0 or negative stars this place would have it. Between the rude staff, screwing up orders or the homeless hangout I don't know which quality is worse. I come here only cause it's near me but is the worst DD I've ever been to and the Indians who run the place don't care about making it any better.i would beware and go somewhere else."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2019-09-01,1,"the service is so bad here, the lady told me that she didn't understand my order AFTER i gave it, and gave me the wrong coffee twice. she then proceeded to tell me how to describe my order in the future, in a very condescending way. i've ordered the same simple coffee from dunkin' for many years with zero issues elsewhere..."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2019-06-21,4,"Always come here to get my coffee.
Clean place and they have a outdoor seat which is great for summer."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2019-05-02,1,Service poor. Today I waited 10 minutes in a queue only to be ignored by the 3 guys at the counter who preferred to serve customers who were behind me or who just barged in front. This is unacceptable.
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2019-03-22,1,"So, I want to like this Dunkin' Donuts. It's close to home.  But, honestly, these people seem to get it all wrong. Once I walked in and asked for one of their breakfast sandwiches - it takes 15 minutes, now running late for work.

 Once I bought their pre-packed chocolate ice cream. Took it home, it was all icey and tasted terrible. So I told them, offered to bring back the ice cream to show them. They said sorry, no can do. 

I used to like the upstairs seating. For sometime they've decided to limit the hours so that it's always closed in the evenings. Whn it is open, they can't keep it clean -I think they have a different sense of cleanliness than I do. 

So finally, I decided to buy hand-packed ice cream. It costs more but this way I knew I would get fresh ice cream, not iced-over ice cream (see above). I got home, and the pint is not filled up! They are too lazy to press down a full pint into the pint container. And, of course, I paid more for it. 

Guys, get it together! Dunkin' Donuts Corporation...  please come in and train these guys! They are ruining your brand!"
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2018-08-02,1,I wish I could give this no stars !! We went in for ice cream last night and there was a line almost out the door!! As I get closer I see the woman at the counter texting on her cell phone. Totally oblivious to the growing mass of customers behind her !! And there was many other employees just standing there doing nothing!! It's amazing how this place stays in business.
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2018-01-31,2,"Ordered a blueberry coffee and two sweet black pepper bacon croissant sandwiches in the morning around 9am. Thought it would be a quick order considering it's a coffee/donut store but geeeez do they need a better ordering system. Coffee came out quick, but had to wait 20 minutes for my two sandwiches. I watched as 7 or 8 people who ordered AFTER me grab their sandwich order and leave before I even got mine. Long story short, someone grabbed my order. By the time the staff who was making sandwiches realized what happened, he continued to make a few more sandwiches before starting on mine. Not cool. If I was in a rush, I'd be upset, but since I wasn't in a rush, I let it go. Still though, this Dunkin' donut location needs a better ordering system if they want to be more efficient. 

Fyi, the customer who grabbed my sandwich got an extra sandwich because there was 1 sandwich that stayed on the counter the entire time I was waiting for my order. So not only was that wasted, but time and money as well."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2017-07-29,2,"This has got to be the worst Dunkin I have ever been to and unfortunately it's on my usual route so I put up with it when I really wish I didn't have to. Basically the staff don't give a care at all about the customers. At least half the time they get the order wrong and it's because they do not pay attention, don't listen and don't stop talking to each other long enough to actually focus on the client. Today I was third in line, the three staff were laughing and talking to each other behind the counter ignoring the customers completely and when they finally took the orders they literally messed up both drinks before mine as well as mine! I hope corporate knows how many drinks they throw away because the staff are not interested in paying attention to the customers."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2017-07-11,4,"One of the better locations in the areas and it has been renovated recently so that is a major draw.  The location is clean and has indoor and outdoor seating.  For quick service, use mobile ordering on the go.  My iced coffee was prepared as specified and tasted great."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2017-07-05,2,"This Dunkin' Donuts is awful, the people are rude and do not know How to make any frozen drinks. They made the wrong drink and told me that it was the right one. I would rather walk 5 blocks out of the way to go to another DD than this one. I have gotten sick from their drinks a few time to. Only come here cause it's close."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2017-06-11,5,"Service is super nice from baskin robbbins! One of the employees, Dori was kind enough to let us sample as many ice cream flavors as we want and gave us big scoops"
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2017-02-07,3,as i was waiting for a friend i stopped at this dd which has outdoor seating when weather permits and indoor upstairs seating . it is a hangout for the homeless at times but thankfully none as i sit while i enjoy my bagel with low fat cream cheese and a hot chocolate . plenty of space to sit and it's fairly clean for a tuesday morning. the staff are ok and and do give an effort to keep place clean and organized . the usual dd menu with a limited baskin robbins offering as well. the location is 2nd ave and 40th st.
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2016-12-12,1,"Why is DD still using styrofoam?  According to Business Insider, they promised to stop using the material 6 years ago.

So why do I even go there?  On rare occasions I get a craving for coffee and sugar and succumb to my carnal thirst when there's nothing else around.  I am weak at times, but working on it.

Immediate update as my coworker is walking in with a DD coffee in a paper cup.  He tells me that if you get the small coffee they serve it in a paper cup but if you go larger it's styrofoam.  Maybe there is change a brewin'."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2016-10-10,1,"This place is awful. The doughnuts are stale, hospitality can use some training, and most of all owner doesn't care. Close this place down ASAP before anyone else suffers."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2016-09-09,1,"DISGUSTING!!!!

I walked in so excited for a donut. I approach the register and I see a fly on a donut. Ok no big deal it happens. but I keep looking just to be sure. Next thing I see is donuts literally COVERED in baby flies. It was disgusting. That means maggots were certainly somewhere shortly before. I wanted to vomit. I said something to the associate. She just shrugged. I'm good I will NEVER go there again for anything. So gross!"
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2016-05-26,1,"Definitely won't be coming back here again. The Indian guy screamed at the African American guy because he was giving me a bigger scoop than he was told. I asked for one scoop and the Indian guy ended up giving me a scoop the size of a kid serving. Won't come back here, they need to learn how to treat all their employees correctly ."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2016-04-02,1,Linguistic barriers prevented our group and numerous customers behind us to receive our order accurately.
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2016-03-03,2,"Hopefully the owners read this and take action. This location has become more of a homeless shelter than coffee shop, please clean this place up."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2015-11-06,1,"Long line, bad customer service and wait 10 mins for my hot latte."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2015-10-02,2,"This place is hit or miss for me. Sometimes I go there and the service and food is good. Other times I go there and I'm amazed at the complete lack of skill of some of the employees. Instead of them trying to be all things to all people. They should stick to their core menu of donuts, coffee drinks and tea.  Better to be good at one thing than to be bad at everything."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2015-09-27,4,"I was looking to kill some time one morning before my doctor's appointment.  I was very impressed with this location.  What drew me initially was the huge corner space and huge outdoor seating area.  There was a long line that went pretty fast.  Everything was speedy and orderly.  Most importantly, they spoke clearly and got my order correct.  Can't say anything about the Baskin Robbins part since I only indulged in the Dunkin Donuts aspect.  Extremely fresh bagel and not overly toasted.  Very nice upstairs seating area!  Was very surprised by that.  Lots of outlets so you can charge whatever you need.  Very refreshing to see that.  Nice and clean with the exception for hand prints and smudges on the glass partitions in the upstairs seating area.  This was my first and only experience here but if I'm in the area again, I would definitely come back.  Also an ATM on premises."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2015-09-07,2,This corner location has a poor Baskin flavor roster and nastier staff.
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2012-08-30,3,"People keep knockin this place!  The service is pretty good and come on... the Pralines and Cream makes everything better.

Definitely find your way here because they're great at letting you try samples and the donuts are usually pretty fresh!"
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2012-04-25,1,"Very rarely do I review a franchise, especially one that I love such as dunkin donuts. However, this location is so awful that it deserves its own review. 

The service behind the counter is always spotty and inattentive. The place is consistently dirty, and by all means do not go upstairs, they have some major air conditioning issues up there and it's not a temporary problem. It's been a million degrees upstairs every time I have gone there for the past 6 months. 

I very much limit my business at this location, which sucks because it's only a block away from my apartment and I hit a dunkin donuts almost daily.

This place needs new management."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2011-11-17,1,"this is probably the worst DD location i've ever been to. the workers are always slacking behind the counter and joking with each other, the coffee always tastes horrible -- i don't think they wash the pots. the donuts are usually stale. 

if i really need coffee and ASAP, i always pass on hot coffee and just go for the iced coffee, it's hard to mess that up but even there they do it sometimes. if i don't mind holding out a little longer, i usually just walk a couple of blocks over and hit starbucks."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2011-10-02,4,This is for the Baskin Robbins section which is what I tried. It was kinda late and I had a hankering for ice cream. The nice employere patiently let me sample some of the new flavors (2) till I chose the flavor of the month; french  toast. Yummm!
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2010-01-07,2,"The staff here is a little slow, in both speed and wits. I placed my order and paid, and then they left me standing there for several long minutes as the counter person tried to figure out how to work the register. She didn't seem like she was new, either.

On the plus side, they have Baskin Robbins cakes of various sizes in a freezer available as well as the full BR ice cream section."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2009-05-28,1,"I live in the building and the tables outside are a nice touch, but that's literally all this place has going for it. Everything I've ever gotten from this particular DD has been atrocious. The coffee has been watery at times, burnt and overly strong at others. The only time I ordered donuts, one was stale and the other was a grease bomb (I may have been able to wring it out had I not thrown it out first). Haven't eaten a donut in nearly a year because of my experience here. If I'm ever able to try one again, I'll be walking the 2 blocks up to 42nd and 2nd...that location, although smaller, is infinitely better than this one."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2009-03-21,2,"The upstairs of this place is ridiculously hot.  I can see how someone would find it nice and toasty when it's blistering cold outside, but it still felt like 100 degrees up there.  Definitely take your food or coffee to go.

The service is fast and friendly, there are some cute little tables outside where you can eat and people-watch (one of my personal favorites).

And I've said it once and I'll say it again, DD NEVER gets an order exactly right.  Even if it's something as small as not slicing your bagel in half."
109,dunkin-new-york-47,2008-08-26,1,"Out of all the Dunkin Donuts shops that I've been too, this is the worst! The first time I came here, I got an iced coffee and a flat bread sandwich. The coffee was bad! It was more like water with a little milk and sugar. The sandwich looked good but then when I bit into it, it was cold! Even a bit icy! I threw everything away!

Since I live really near, I gave it a second try. I went and ordered iced coffee again. No change! It still didn't taste good!

There's another Dunkin Donuts shop two blocks away. That's where I get my coffee coz they do it really good there."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2020-03-09,5,"I love this store! People who work here are happy, helpful and classy!  Food are delicious  and fresh!"
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2020-01-27,5,First time at this chain and it was a pretty pleasant experience. They have Vegan options which is important to me and the Moroccan Lentil soup was more than I expected! Way to go Prett A Manger
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2019-11-02,1,Rude customer service.  My drink was made wrong and came out cold. Asked to have it redone and was argued with by staff and then they over steamed the milk to make it so hot it was undrinkable.  Do not go here
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2019-09-20,1,"No croissants no bagels no pastries

NOTHING ready at 6:55 am???

Some other times coffee not ready at 7 am??

Just close shop....CLOSE IT

Don't blame the employees...blame management/owners"

110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2019-07-11,1,"I bought some breads and coffee in this store. And I could't believe that they forgot my order of coffee. I had to wait for a long time until they have served all other people who came after me. After that, they asked me to show the receipt to prove I bought the coffee. And they didn't feel any apology for this. So if you came to this store, don't throw your receipt!"
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2019-07-09,1,"Food is normal.  Management is horrible.  More than half of the time coffee pot are empty during the rush hours in the morning.  Staffs are very unprofessional.  Slow, bad attitude.  Long wait at cashier even not busy."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2019-05-26,5,Delighted to find this near our hotel. The fresh food and sustainability of the business is excellent.
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2019-03-22,1,I just walked into this place where I have been spending money for years and this newbie started giving me an attitude and asking if everything was ok w me? Are u serious?! Go check your own attitude and mental state before you start working with customers. This is the 2nd time Im getting attitude from cashiers! Im dropping this place. Nothing but a zoo over here.
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2019-03-15,4,"Many choices for lunch, even huge salad bowl's with tasteful compositions. Coffee is good, and here are also small treats to go with the coffee! I'm a returning customer"
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2019-01-09,4,"Have not had a bad experience, service is pretty good generally, and food is great. I understand that they run out from time to time, part of the risk with fresher food. Lentil soup is the way to go. Watch the calorie count on the grilled cheese, that's the only downside here... Falls a little bit outside what I might expect from an otherwise health forward fast food restaurant.  Good drip coffee, probably my favorite in the area if I want something quick."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2018-09-18,1,"Terrible. An employee by the name if charmaine is rude and disgusting. High turnover if employees so you rarely see familiar faces. The atmosphere is fine but its only for stuck up yuppies and business professionals. Avoid vindora/helen and ashley. Those two female managers are very condescending. Food is good, but those all three of the people i mentioned have to go."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2018-08-26,3,"Food is good and prices are accesible, staff is friendly. Just wanted ask you to double check you're being charged the correct amount and for the right food, was charged with a more expensive sandwich and didn't realize until later..."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2018-08-11,5,"I highly recommend this restaurant. Friendly, professional employees, especially Varnell. He treated my daughter so special since it was her bday! We will definitely be back. Ps. The chicken noodle soup was delicious!"
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2018-08-10,5,"There are several of these around town but this one was next to my hotel so I popped in several times.  The iced coffee was delicious, I probably had 4 or 5 this week.  The sandwiches we're tasty and I appreciated the fresh options, including fruit.  I wish these were near my home so I could go here more often."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2018-08-02,4,"This is the happening place between 7:00-9:30 AM ( is the best time for people watching ) You will see sales person at Sephora,  billionaire,  office workers wait -on -line for coffee, breakfast quiche / sandwiches.  I always loved Pret - a - manger.  But this location is the best :  1) back up helpers on line to help out on waiting customers 2) one person always checking out shelves for refills 3) coffee refill personnel is always on the go   I love their food ( my quiche was piping HOT ) But I m not impressed with their diluted coffee.  Nope  I had to go down to starbucks ( 1 hour later for my java )"
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2018-06-05,5,"This place has super fast services, and I really enjoyed their coffee and bagels. Since it was so fast, I didn't expect to have a warm and toasted bagel, but it was! They have regular, decaf and flavored self-serve coffee. The place was busy, and they didnt seem like to have time to pay enough attention to the self-serve area.. they ran out cups and sleeves, but they were nice and helped me out quickly when I asked for their help at the counter."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2018-04-06,1,"This is the worst place. I work nearby so I only go in when I am in an hurry or am lacking better judgment. Every time, they amaze me with how inept they are. They run out of food. They run out of coffee. They run out of milk, and cups, and sleeves, and utensils... On a daily basis. The staff is clueless and doesn't pay attention. The lines to pay are disorganized chaos. Only about half of the lines have the LevelUp app functioning, so you wait on a line and get to the front and they tell you to get in a different line to pay. They have mischarged me for the wrong food items. They must have some mandated ""give-the-customer-a-compliment"" policy, because really, my coat is really just okay, please stop staring at me blankly for a full 20 seconds when i get to the front of the frustrating line and then compliment my coat. I get it. Ugh. I go in every now and then, and I know you're going to run out of coffee. You work there every day, how do you not anticipate that? Make more coffee. It's simple."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2018-03-28,2,They run out of food on a regular basis. The lines to pay  are utter chaos...no organization at all...no manager to direct the lines...people skipping...frustrating experience
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2018-02-17,4,"I like the simplicity of Pret if you just want a coffee and croissant. The baristas can certainly whip up something fancy, but sometimes it's nice to just serve yourself a cup.

The chocolate hazelnut croissant is noteworthy, because it's filled like pain au chocolate, but is the shape and consistency of a croissant."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2017-12-28,5,"The staff is really nice and friendly, the space is always clean and welcoming. The salads are my favorite, and it's annoying the dressing costs extra but they are so fresh and tasty it's worth it. They donate their extra food each day, which a lot of places don't do. Their coffee is really good. Love this place"
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2017-12-13,4,"Fresh, hot, delicious simple food. Just what was needed in the middle of my visit to NYC."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2017-11-02,4,"We were looking for a place to grab a small bite for breakfast and saw this place out of our hotel window. I don't eat bread so it is always a little hard to find something, but I ended up grabbing the balsamic chicken with mozzarella and tomato baguette and an English Breakfast tea while my mom grabbed an egg and avocado baguette and a coffee. Everything was delicious! My mom really enjoyed her coffee. The atmosphere was great, the employees were friendly, and the prices were pretty reasonable (especially for being right off of Times Square!)"
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2017-09-21,2,"I really only go to Pret for coffee and their chocolate chip cookie. Lately, in the last few months, this location decided they weren't going to leave their milk supply out, for the coffee. You have to go to the counter and ask for it. Really annoying and inefficient. I'm also not sure if its just this location or a new Pret policy."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2017-08-22,3,"I come here regularly as it is right across the street from my office. Food is always a solid option here but my review is on a drink I recently ordered, iced almond milk matcha latte. I literally cringed when I saw them make it. They poured the matcha powder directly into the cold almond milk and stirred but that just left huge clumps of the powder at the bottom of my drink. All the other pret's that I've gotten it from mixed the powder with a little hot water first to make it smooth and then poured it into the milk. Not sure if it was laziness or lack of knowledge but please keep it consistent."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2017-08-10,4,"Great quick and affordable place for lunch.
After walking through Central Park stopped in for a well needed break."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2017-07-25,2,"Why are all the Prets in this area so sloppy? I used to often get lunch at Pret when I worked in other parts of the city, but the 3 locations nearest me in the Rockefeller Center area are so sloppy, I've often gone in, looked at the food, and left in disgust. The one in the concourse, the one on 50th between 6th and 7th, and the one on 7th and 52nd all have a problem making sandwiches in particular - they seem to think the best way to make a sandwich is to have 2/3rd of the ingredients falling out of the front. Get it together!"
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2017-06-19,5,"This location is spacious. 
The almond croissants are the bomb. 
They are light flaky and buttery but I still got an extra side of butter to add to this croissant. It's a great breakfast and reasonably priced.
The green / mango tea with pomegranate is refreshing and delicious. 
The staff is friendly, the wifi is reliable and it's not far from radio city hall. This place is a great cheaper priced option for this area."
110,pret-a-manger-new-york-79,2017-03-17,4,"Good quick stop for healthy munchees! There's also free wifi! I had the kale Caesar salad, chicken not much flavor but that's where dressing comes in. I really love Pret A Manger's coconut water!! The fact that they aren't wasteful and give their food away to the hungry makes me happy and always want to support them! Wish more food establishments would do the same!"
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2020-01-14,2,"I get why this place got two stars. it's small and not that clean, service horrible in the rush hours. Coffee's okay, but if you are paying roughly the same amount as you do in Starbucks... why bother?"
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2019-12-07,1,First and last! Cashier was very rude and impatient. Didn't listen to a thing I or anyone in my party said. I would much rather die from starvation than come back to this place. If I was you I'd save my money and not even think about going to this place. THEY DONT EVEN HAVE A DAMN BATHROOM. WHERE DO THEY EXPECT YOU TO PEE??? Ridiculous.
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2019-07-01,1,Rude cashiers esp the old lady. Talking to them in the morning doesn't start my day well. Machines seem to be broken here all the time. Need new DD around here.
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2019-05-08,1,"These IDIOTS deserve -5 stars! Everyone needs to be fired and the place needs a good scrubbing. If you care about your body or your health DO NOT GO HERE! It's the filthiest Dunkin Donuts that I've EVER been to with the RUDEST employees EVER!!! Because of my experience at the Lexington Avenue location, I WILL BOYCOTT DUNKIN DONUTS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE! I don't even know what was going through my mind when I decided to go here. I usually go to Starbucks or Pret! NEVER AGAIN!"
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2019-02-02,1,Came here for coffee and a bagel at 7 am. Doors were locked and workers inside. Should have been open at 6 am. Refused to make me a bagel because they were fulfilling a bigger order other than mine.  Only when I argued with them to make it because I was here now did they reluctantly make my order.
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2018-09-26,1,"Terrible service. I ordered something via their APP. When I went there to pick up my stuff, I showed them my order history on my phone, the cashier was so rude and said "" That is what you said, it does not meant we have your order"" . OMG, I ordered and paid already. And I showed her my receipt on my phone. Did she just said I was a liar? The manager came over apologized and told her to make my drink, then she made a regular coffee instead of my decaf coffee.......She didn't even bother to read what I've ordered. You don't want to pay, and then receive a bad attitude."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2018-03-26,1,"If I could give zero stars i would. The worst service i have ever encountered in any type of place. Not just one time, but every time. They are the rudest to everyone."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2017-04-30,4,"Not that different from any other Dunkin' Donuts, but it still tasted good. It was right outside of my hotel, so it was easy to walk to."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2017-04-01,5,"This Dunkin is superior in terms of service. They were courteous and quick. The person doing the food not only got it right, but packaged it neatly and called out the order and what it consisted of loudly and clearly. The good and coffee are both excellent. Dunkin ATM there if you need, but really you should use the AP.

This is a Dunkin so not much else to say except if you don't think this store is good, I really don't know what you are expecting."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2016-12-30,1,"I would rather die in a fiery car crash due to exhaustion at the wheel then get coffee from this Dunkin Donuts. The guys that work there not only hate their job but hate you. Ordering coffee? Get ready to be ignored and have your order wrong. When it's wrong and you want it remade? It will be 20 minutes. Literally. In the mood for a donut? You're too fat. Have a bran muffin or a jelly munchkin because that's the only option.

This place is garbage."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2016-12-04,1,"Cashier rang up the wrong order, overcharging me by several dollars. Instead of just saying sorry and giving me back my money, he proceeds to berate me for some imaginary offense to cover himself. What a rude man."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2016-10-19,3,"Dunkin Donuts. One of my New Yorker friends craves for this place. Coffee is good. Donuts are good. But, I don't get the craze. It's a chain that spreads across to parts of the country. This location seems like any other. Maybe I'm missing something that makes this chain so amazing. It's good. Fills the sugary need. Fills you with caffeine. Maybe that's the big deal."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2016-08-15,1,"Never coming here again no matter how bad my coffee craving is. I asked for a medium dark roast hazelnut swirl with cream and less ice. Seems simple right? Except they got my order completely wrong. First, they gave me regular hazelnut rather than the swirl version. Second, it seemed like the guy used milk rather than cream. I asked them to add more cream and the employee reluctantly took it with an unhappy/rude face. The janitor made a comment saying ""more cream, more money."" What?! At that point I just wanted to get out of there. I need to remind myself to taste Dunkin' coffee before I leave the store because this is not the first time the chain has messed up my order. I'm a loyal Dunkin' customer and this is the worst experience I've ever had. I forced myself to drink it all day because I didn't want to waste it but still ended up throwing half of it out. Overall, avoid this location at all costs unless you like having your order messed up and horrible customer service."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2016-03-10,5,"I really don't understand the previous reviews. 

Well I only go in this location around 8AM every day. It's extremely tiny and the line is always out the door. With that being said, there is NO TIME for customer service. The employees have a routine going on one or two makes the drinks the other makes the food and three of them will ring you up. I probably will spend a total of 5 minutes in there with line and waiting and paying. It's exactly what I need for a morning rush

The store is tiny and a little dark. It is wheel chair accessible, crazy for such a tiny Dunkin. With it being so small, employees have to be extra clean because one napkin on the floor will make the place look like a dump. But what I've seen so far is cleanliness, for the morning rush the employees do a good job of keeping the counters clear and somewhat free of mess.

Maybe later in the day the customer service is less than, but I'm only commenting on the morning service. I can see they have some regulars. The employees are warm but you can tell all they care about is the line. Which is everything! Coming from when I used to be in retail, I never wanted my customers to wait in line forever. So kudos to the morning rush staff."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2015-12-09,1,"I wish I could contact their franchise manager. He needs to hire people who are capable of listening and providing good service. when I ask for extra liquid sugar (i know, its bad) they give me this stare. after i receive my ice caramel latte, it has way too much milk and no liquid sugar. 
they are rude. they do  not listen to your requests. 
there is only one employee who seems to be there Monday thru Friday and she makes my ice coffee perfect, why because she listens!!!!!!!!!! the only Latina employee happens to be the best one in this store. i hope her manager sees this because she is the only one who deserves a raise."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2015-08-21,1,"There's an ongoing promo for DD Perk Members for any size Iced Coffee for just $1.99.  So today, I got my medium iced coffee.  When it was time for me to pay, the cashier tells me that the system is not working.  I think they should give DD Perk Members a heads up by putting up a SIGN whenever there's an issue with their register.  I was annoyed because I had to pay for the full price and I did not even get my reward points.  When I told the register that I don't want it anymore, the guy tells me to just take it for free making me feel even worst.   I don't want free coffee if it's not meant to be for free.  Maybe he should've suggested other options like charging me $1.99 like the promo says.  There's a reason why I signed up for the DD Perk card and that's because I love getting special offers and free beverage.  But how can I get anything free if my points are not going up?"
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2015-08-19,1,"Horrible! Always rude staff, always dirty, no matter what time I go! They are fast in the mornings but when there is no customer around they need like 10 minutes to finish your order its like everything is done in slow-mo when there are only 2-3 customers... I love my coffee from DD especially cause they serve almond milk which pret down the block does not. However Pret has much better service so I guess I will be going there until they fix this location. All my coworkers hate this location too btw lol It must be poorly managed because most of the DD I know have nicer staff."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2015-08-13,1,"Rude! Horrible service, awful food. I occasionally pick up something for someone else at my office if I'm out and about and one of my coworkers always wants iced coffee from Dunkin. I'm always shocked at the lack of respect for customers. They've stopped mid order to take some one else's order, left people hanging and confused. I've seen them be rude to people who got their orders wrong, ignore you if you're waiting. 

I've had to wait on food before and every time a man always HAS to mop right where you are standing. His solution is to have you stand on the wet, slippery floor, on the steps by the door and wait for your food and walk out when the floor is super wet. 

Avoid this location at all costs!"
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2015-07-08,1,"I've gone here three times over three different months and unfortunately, the service has always been poor. I understand there is a morning rush - but twice they've put my coffee on the counter without announcing what it was - so I didn't know it was mine. I love Dunkies but not this one."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2015-07-03,1,"The worst DD i have ever been in. Terrible service and the worst Ham, Egg and Cheese I've had. I work for a cafe so I didnt need coffee. The guy on register barely spoke English and the lady making the food gave me literally one slice of ham. Other locations give me sandwiches the look at least similar to the picture. This location will never get my business again."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2015-06-05,1,"Ok this probably won't be a review worthy of an ""elite"" or what have you. But sometimes, you just have to vent. 

It is national donut day. It is one of my favorite days of the year. Today, I work the late shift, 4pm to midnight. I think to myself, no problem, I'll get my donut before work.

Wrong. I was so, so wrong. At 3:40 pm, on national donut day, Dunkin Donuts was OUT OF DONUTS. No ""we'll have more soon"", just ""we're out of donuts"". I have never felt so betrayed, so wounded. I spit on this ground, and curse their ovens. May this facade of a donut shop wither away like my hopes and dreams."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2015-05-24,1,I wouldn't even give this place one star unfortunately I have no other choice. It's right by my job so i stop by for some quick coffee. Today I stopped by the moron who was working there payed me no mind I said excuse me about two times... still nothing then I began to get aggravated and got louder I thougth maybe he didnt hear me. Nope he heard me but he was busy making hash browns for 3 minutes and I was now waiting for about 5 and started running late i said hello!!! he turns around slowly with the nastiest look ... I left cursing him out... will never return ever again. Excpet to send the health inspection their way to shut them down.
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2015-04-14,2,Typical DD.  Coffee was OK. Breakfast sucked. The spicy omelet flatbread gave me a flashback to bad airline food. Big mistake.  Stick with the doughnuts.
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2015-01-16,2,This Dunkin' Donuts has a two star rating and I see why. Even the restaurants excellent coffee and croissant with egg and sausage breakfast cannot overcome the fact that:(1) the seating area is small and unclean; (2) the employees are a bit on the inept side; and (3) they just do not spend the time cleaning this place.
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2014-11-15,1,"i was on my way to work, why i picked this spot, is a mystery. this place is not clean looking.the donuts, bagels, and muffins are well display, but,i dont know, how fresh they are , when i ask. the girl, she only said that its good. ok that means something is not right.i pick a dz mixed donuts, and headed to work. the donuts were dry on the edges and the jelly donuts fillings,were not up to par. i will not be back at this spot, the workers have a uncaring attitude. i have other dd spots better to go to.   p.s when i walked in and saw the dirty floors and bad vibes, that should have been my turn around to the exit moment."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2014-11-10,1,"This place is dirty, the service is ridiculously slow, and the doughnuts look like they've been sitting out for days.

But even if the place had been sparkling clean with super fast friendly service and had the freshest doughnuts ever on the particular Saturday I went there, I would have still given this place zero stars if I could.

Why? Because they left off the TURKEY on my TURKEY CHEDDAR BACON SANDWICH! 

You know what that sandwich amounted to? A roll with a single slice of cheese and two teeny strips of bacon and some sauce. That's completely inexcusable and just plain stupid.

I don't know how they can make such a terrible error. That's like making a burger without the hamburger patty. What???

Unluckily for me, I was already on a bus by the time I unwrapped my sandwich. That has to be the most pathetic excuse of a sandwich I've ever seen. Does that even qualify as a sandwich? 

I made the mistake of going here based its convenience. I won't make that mistake again."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2014-08-07,3,"Never been  DD fan, more of a Starbucks lover. But I wanted to try out one of their new drinks that I keep seeing advertised: the Strawberry Coolata. I wanted it to be something more than what it was I guess, I am a bit disappointed that I didn't fall in love with the drink but it is what it is. It was a bit too sugary.

Bonus: Didn't know they served Coffee Cake Muffins. That was delicious. Big fan of coffee cakes, will definitely be coming back for that even if it's the only thing I get."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2014-08-01,1,"I get that everyone leaves the city on weekends but if you're going to be open, try a little. The place was outright dirty, had maybe a 1/10 of the donut bins with anything -stale donuts. I also got a hazelnut coffee. Milk was spoiled or something was wrong with it. Lot of options in this area - no need to go here."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2014-07-01,3,Service has improved.  Ordered 14 boxes with no warning for an impromptu office event and picked it up and was greeted nicely.  Service with a smile done right.  Would order from here again.  They threw in muffins and munchkins too!
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2014-03-31,1,"For some reason I keep giving this store another chance, only to be disappointed every single time.  It is the closest Dunkin to my job, but today was the last time I will go to this location.
  
-Every time I go here, the coffee tastes like dirt.  They manage to make any iced coffee taste terrible.  I asked for real sugar in the iced coffee (they tend to use that liquid stuff) and today they didn't put any sugar at all.

-The previous poster who wrote about them not liking the free donut coupon - very true.  The guy gave me a dirty look today when I used it and reluctantly punched it in to the computer.  They also did not give me my receipt, which probably would have entitled me to another donut.

The donuts and pastries taste fine, no qualms there.

For a place like this to have consistently terrible tasting coffee, I just don't understand the point in returning.  They don't seem to care and rush through your order, even when the store is empty."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2014-02-14,1,This place is awful. The customer service sucks. They are rude. I have been to this location 3 times and each time the experience was just as bad.
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2014-01-25,2,This is not the best Dunkin location.  It's always super crowded in the mornings and the line moves slowly.  They've screwed up my order a few times (I always request drinks w/o whipped cream and somehow they always come with whipped cream).  The staff is also not very friendly.
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2013-12-02,1,"If it was possible to rate this DD without a star, I would do it. THIS PLACE IS DOWNRIGHT UNSANITARY. I ordered a sandwich this morning, and the guy actually put down the egg/sausage/cheese combo on the dirty counter with NOTHING underneath while the croissant was being heated up as though it was nothing! 

Needless to say, I walked out, threw out the germy sandwich and went elsewhere. Never going back."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2013-11-26,1,"If I can give this place zero star I would. That speaks volume about my experiences here. I tell myself each and every time I'm not coming back but because it's the closest Dunkin around work, I keep coming back. The cashiers are rude, rude and RUDE!! Somehow they managed to ruin all the drinks I like (it takes talent to do that). And every time I get lattes, I feel like I'm drinking milk and there's hardly any espresso taste. I'm normally not one to bash a business but this has got to be the worst Dunkin Donut location out there. Service has been bad CONSISTENTLY! 
Please avoid for your own sake."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2013-09-26,1,The girl working as the cashier was really rude and the place was not very clean. Won't be back again
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2013-02-26,3,"Pro:
-cheap and decent!  cheap donuts, cheap coffee, cheap lunch sandwiches
 (currently offering $2.99 sandwiches!!)
-amount (compared to Starbucks): the ""medium"" is a extra large in starbucks! 
-the rest?  it's just an old dunkin donuts.

Con:
-very angry manager/owner.  I've seen him interrogated a girl who bought a coffee from the cafe next door--she just want to tried it out for god's sake!
-does not give you receipt unless you ask because...
-manager is not happy with having to accept 'free donut' coupon (obtained by filling out a online survey)  


I am not sure how the coupon works, I'm sure he would be refunded for the 'free donut'?!   It's the recession, the free donut is certainly an advantage for the consumers to take, so looking at me with hatred will not work... 

Other than the anger, the store can use some basic in-store marketing, a simple renovation or layout update."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2013-01-07,1,"Absolutely the worst DD I have ever been to, but worse than that, one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.  

My bf and I needed to eat after walking around for hours.  We made the stupid decision to walk in to DD instead of any of the other places to eat on the streets surrounding it.  We love DD coffee at home, and in high school the DD in the town was delicious, so why not?  

OMG, first of all, the men behind the counter didn't really understand us.  They messed up the order that I spoke in complete English.  But fine, we got what we asked for eventually (with the exception of a Coke Zero) and sat down to eat.  The Texas Toast was at least a week old.  The eggs on the sandwich were disgusting and mealy and I'm not sure what they actually were...certainly not eggs.  The hash browns tasted like old onion grease.  I ate half a piece of toast and called it done.

The bf had something on a croissant that was less offensive, but equally unacceptable for a $4 sandwich.  He eats pretty much everything and wouldn't eat the hash browns. 

The customer service was the worst part, no greeting, no knowledge of the menu (I mean it is donuts and sandwiches), no smile.  

Really, really poor food and disappointing service."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2012-06-16,1,"I was CURSED OUT by an employee of this DD after being YELLED at for not liking the iced coffee he had made for me. 

Two employees were also yelling at one another the whole time they were behind the counter working on my order. 

They REFUSED to simply refund my money after failing to make my coffee correctly two times. 

Then the  temper of one employee began to boil over and the shouting began.

After my five year old was almost in tears assuring my sister (her aunt) that she in fact, was not ""a S**T,"" like the employee at this DD told her she was, I vowed to do everything in my power to voice my UNBELIEVABLE experience I had at this DD."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2012-02-28,3,"this place can get really busy at 9 AM.

traffic goes out thru the  door  for their AM coffee.

no problem with taking coupons.

like most other branches."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2011-09-16,5,"Primer: I love Dunkin Donuts. I drink it at home. I go out of my way to find one when looking to buy coffee since Starbucks makes me want to crawl up a wall.
If I worked at this store I would go postal. Yet the staff at this store is ALWAYS friendly; ALWAYS smiles; is SO efficient and super fast that it boggles my mind.
Postal."
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2010-03-31,1,I love the Dunkaccino but I don't understand why I would have to wait longer than 10 mins for them to pour me a pre-made drink. It also doesn't help that I had to repeat my order three times to the guy who was not paying any attention. Way to go...
111,dunkin-new-york-108,2008-02-11,4,"Dunkin' Donuts always seems to get a bad rap as the blue collar alternative to Starbucks.  Coffee is cheaper and the store is filled with all kinds of unhealthy and sugary items to tempt you.  There are no frills here and people do not lounge around drinking their lattes with their pinkies pointed out.  

Is this a bad thing?  I don't think so.  Dunkin Donuts is a daily ritual for me.  I honestly can barely function without my Large Turbo Hot with half and half and two splendas (in case anyone really enjoys this review and wants to buy me one).  

The Turbo Hot is possibly the greatest thing to happen to coffee since the legendary goat-herder Kaldi of Ethiopia notices his goats are friskier after eating the red berries of a local shrub. Tries the berries himself and feels happier. (google that one and you'll know what I'm talking about).  It truly is a masterpiece with both drip coffee and a shot of espresso... all in one cup!!!!  

And for the humanitarians out there, DD uses fair trade beans."

The place is clean , quiet and with coffee that competitive price, and the cookies are a must try."
112,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york-6,2018-06-07,5,"Excellent coffee, especially when it is piping hot (go in the morning and this is guaranteed). Salads are top-quality (grilled chicken greek or beet salad are scrumptious). Chocolate chip cookies are perfect (soft in the middle with crispy edges and oh so gooey). Bagels are of good quality. Almond croissants and cranberry walnut muffins are delicious. Manager Ivan is committed to excellent customer service, is friendly and remembers his customers. The staff is great at remembering your regular order. It's the people that bring me back to a business, and this one is included."
112,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york-6,2017-07-10,1,"I went here with my girlfriend as we were looking for a place to get a drink, settle down, and get some work done. I got just a hot coffee and it was terrible. I work as a barista and I could tell the coffee was old, as it was already getting bitter and sour. It wasn't hot either. Instead, it was warm, and after adding cream and sugar to tolerate the sour flavor it was barely lukewarm. 

It was also excessively cold inside and uncomfortable for anyone wanting to sit and do work. 

If I could give this place a zero star I would. The lady at the counter was nice but overall I wish I could just get my money back or something hot to drink."
112,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york-6,2017-02-03,5,"Great coffee, amazing chocolate chip cookies, lovely ambience, and the service is outstanding!"
112,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york-6,2017-01-16,5,"Best grilled chicken Caesar salad in the area. They put the chicken on freshly grilled for each salad, so it isn't just sitting there getting the greens soggy. Chocolate chip cookies here are to die for, too."
112,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york-6,2016-03-02,1,Coffee is terrible. I mean downright awful. I consider myself an expert in coffee and this stuff is just undrinkable. Otherwise nice place and decent salads and sandwiches. The espresso is drinkable and ok.
112,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york-6,2016-02-17,5,The only way to start a NY morning. Friendly smiling service and the best coffee in town! Cookies to die for if you want an additional treat!
112,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york-6,2016-01-10,4,"The chocolate chunk cookies are the best around the area. Beware though, people at my company believe someone is stealing credit card info, so always pay in cash!"
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2020-03-03,1,Terrible experience this morning. I went into Starbucks and I placed my order. The person behind the counter had no idea that I was watching . She had the nerve to take my muffin with her hands with no gloss. When I left Starbucks I gave my muffin to a homeless person .WTF.
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2020-01-17,2,"No Almond Milk? No oat milk? This is 2020, and I am a millennial who enjoys seeking out healthy milk alternatives. I was coerced and rushed into taking longer than I should have for deciding upon a dairy substitute as milk is a risky proposition when you sit in an office all day. 

Naturally, I did a 50/50 even split with the coconut and 2% milk, and boy did I face the consequences. If you are going to be the market leader in coffee and related drink products, at least have the necessary supplies. 

Gosh"
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2019-12-26,1,"I went in for coffee Christmas Eve 15 mins before the closing time but I saw them cleaning up so I asked if I can still order, they said yes. My aunt was asking questions about a holiday drink and a tall African American male (who wasn't even in uniform) was very rude, not helpful, and kept saying to hurry up because they're closing... when I got my drink, I asked for whipped cream (which I had asked for when I ordered) and they said they already cleaned it and if they give me whipped cream they will have to clean it again so no. Another female employee heard this and found it very funny. I was flabbergasted. I have never received such awful service from a Starbucks, even in peak hours. The attitude and demeanor of the employees is just so appalling. There are plenty of other starbucks in the area. I will definitely go out of my way to go to a different starbucks next time."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2019-11-05,3,"Starbucks at 599 Lexington is probably the largest branch within a couple of blocks of this one, it's close to the MTA and has a fairly good amount of seating.

I came in store after trying three others without look to find a specific You are Here collection mug to take back home to the UK - this store actually had it! 

The staff here seemed pretty friendly and although they did seem understaffed it did seem to move rather quickly.

Average pricing compared to NY Starbucks standards, which still remains much higher than other branches in the US and considerably higher to back home in the UK and most of Europe.

The enterance into the store through a plastic sort of door and a small dirty porch could be worked on to make it nicer and cleaner overall and it could also be better for disabled customers, although it is step-free. It reminded me a lot of the Manchester Corporation Street / Hanging  Ditch branch back home, but they managed to remove this disgusting porch and the store looks so much better, so I hope they do too!

113,starbucks-new-york-372,2019-09-26,1,The tall african american guy (couldnt get his name) is extremely rude. He had a very rude demeanor towards every customer and was visibly upset if you were a few seconds late in ordering your selection
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2019-09-16,1,The cashier was very rude when we got to the front of the line and asked me twice if I was sure I was ready to order because the last two people weren't. Then he messed up one of our two orders. When we picked up our orders we asked for one of them to be fixed and the barista pretended to fix it and just took the lid on and off. We were late so we didn't bother making a fuss. Then after I left I realized my order was made wrong too and when I got to the bottom of my coffee there were a ton of grinds at the bottom. I never leave reviews but this place has terrible staff. If I had time I would have gone back for my money and talked to a manager.  It wasn't just one of them either. There was also a drink spilled all over the entrance door that had dried on there and it was hard to get in and out without getting it on your clothes. Worst Starbucks I've ever been to and we travel a lot and I was a barista in college. Zero stars!
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2019-09-06,1,"Logging onto the app, virtually all items were sold out across the board, from coffee flavorings to items from the bakery. 

I ordered a coffee and banana. 
My friend ordered a coffee containing soy milk. 
My other friend ordered a matcha drink. 

My coffee was ready for pickup and I was greeted with a smile. My friends coffee wasn't prepared because they had run out of soy milk. Additionally, they ran out of matcha for my other friends drink. This is frustrating because we had already not been able to order what we really wanted, and continued to not substitute orders. We understand that there may be a problem with deliveries but the extent to which there were issues with this location was miserable. 

I didn't have my banana, yet. I asked the woman you greeted me and was then sent to three different staff members to ask again. Someone went in the back and grabbed a new box of bananas. When they lifted the lid, fruit flys flew out, the bananas were warm, and over ripe. I was then told to pick which one I wanted.  

I've never been so disappointed by fruit or the fact that staff was ok I consume it . I paid $1 for a 30c banana that wasn't even edible. 

There are definitely serious issues with this location.

Update: More staff from my job site have used the app to order today and they have now run out of coffee. There is a serious issue with this location."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2019-06-22,1,"Been to many many Starbucks all around the country and outside the country, this is by far the filthiest. Worst attitude, out of everything, really dirty and disgusting. Not more that two customers, but staff can't be bothered. Only if desperate for caffeine. Yuck."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2019-05-15,5,"I'm here like clockwork a few times a week and work nearby. The staff is always on point and welcoming. They have a great system - because of this I like to brag that I'm spoiled --- when I go to any other locations, I'm never truly satisfied like this spot. Jason always knows my order and brings it over - he's the best.

Rush hour can sometimes be challenging but most people don't always understand the concept of patience. With that, there's almost always a barista standing where the mobile orders are grouped and calls out names to get the flow of traffic moving.

Appreciate it all - thank you Starbucks team!!!"
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2019-02-20,5,"This is the Nieman Marcus of Starbucks. I am never in this area unfortunately, so I walk into the Starbucks as I normally do every morning except yesterday was a little bit better .. there was surprisingly no line in the middle of rush hour because the workers were so efficient. An employee was shouting out mobile orders and regular orders to help everything run smoothly. I can easily say that this is the best Starbucks I've ever been to"
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2018-09-03,5,"I loathe going to chains when I travel but had rewards for a free sandwich and you know, just seemed like the right thing to do...eat for free.

This rating is based solely on people, well one person. As a southerner, I have no expectation of the same cordial nature that I get at home. Don't expect rude, but maybe just a matter-of-factness. 

Nyesha (so?) was sweet, kind and funny. Made me feel like a regular. No reason other than she's fantastic at what she does. Thanks for making me feel special!"
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2017-11-29,5,Great people working here--always very professional and friendly.  (Particularly everyone at about 3pm today.)  Thank you!
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2017-11-11,3,"Actually never noticed this Starbucks, and don't think I'll be coming back as per my drink was horrible. Tasted more like milk than coffee. Probably a bad who knows but I won't risk my morning coffee. Not going to neglect the fact that store was probably one of the cleanest Starbucks I've seen."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2017-09-20,4,Probably one of the friendlier Starbucks in a small radius. Never really a frequented location in the evening.
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2017-05-08,5,"I've been to this location multiple times. The baristas are SO nice here. The first time I came, this Thursday around 5:30pm, there was a minor altercation between two guests here... one gentleman yelling and cursing at another gentleman. Once the angry one left the store, the baristas made sure to ask the gentleman on the receiving end if he was okay, and encouraged him to stay by offering him a beverage. They were so nice!  I was impressed by how they handled a very uncomfortable situation."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2017-01-02,3,Middle of the road Starbucks based on available seating and location size.  Coffee and welcoming baristas was standard for Starbucks.
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2016-08-24,3,"I'm not a Starbucks fan. But when your boss wants to take you out for coffee and it's free, well I might just go to Starbucks.

This location has outdoor seating, which is much needed since the inside is small. There's a counter with stools and a handful of tables to sit at, otherwise you're better off grabbing and going. The staff is friendly enough even though the cashier thought my boss was some regular and kept calling her that person's name. My drink was made well but I also get something simple since their coffee is disgusting. Yes, they have a bathroom so those of you who specifically go to Starbucks in case of emergency are safe here. There is also a direct entrance into the Citi building (old Citi building? whatever it is now!). 

Good for a quick fix if you are taking it with you to work or on a walk. Otherwise there are other locations that are better....As well as 3 DD's that surround this place."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2016-08-01,2,"On one of the most disgustingly wet and humid NYC summer days this location had basically no air conditioning working. I walked in here to hopefully get a blast of cool air and enjoy an iced coffee for a few minutes.

Fail.

Small space with some seating. 

A few tables outside if you want to sit in a sauna.  

Moist is the way to describe this place. Moist. So moist.

Like my junk was sitting in here."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2016-07-31,3,"this is not a bad starbucks but i do notice a few times that the garbage cans are not cleared out and the counter area for sugar, straws , etc is messy due to the lazy slobs.this off lexington ave spot between 52nd and 53rd st is semi  spacious with enough tables and seats inside and some outdoor seating when available . the usually starbucks menu of hot and cold drinks, pastries. sandwiches , salads , soups , etc. they have free wifi and power up pads to charge up your phone or tablet . my only complaint is that more then half of the folks inside are sucking up the free wifi and not ordering a darn thing , come on buy a bagel or a scone. when i am meeting up with a friend before work i like to come here cause the girl who works here makes a mean mocha frappe . i would recommend that starbucks corp install new and safe entrance and exit doors cause does swinging doors can knock over an elephant if your not careful ."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2016-07-26,4,"I love Starbucks, this location is no different. 

The coffee is always good and consistent. The staff is generally friendly. 

The wait is often longer than I would like. On weekends they are often understaffed, so even a short line takes forever."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2016-06-09,1,"I never thought I'd do this because I actually enjoy certain Starbucks drink, but the company need to look into this branch because something is going on with their drinks, at least this past month.
2 of my colleagues got drinks with milk that were bad, and their drinks tasting sour. For a few days I'd only been getting brewed coffee so I didn't think much of it. Today I have a long day and got a chai latte with coconut milk, and it tastes extremely weird. I've had this at other branches before and it's one of my favorite drinks but today it tasted sour, and the spices did not taste like chai but other kitchen spices... I don't know what's in my drink and after 4 sips I just can't bring myself to drinking it. One thing I like about chain coffee shops is the reliability of it, and this branch does not provide that."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2016-04-05,3,"This is small Starbucks and is listed at 599 Lexington Ave, but it's really on 52nd Street. It as a entrance inside the 599 building lobby, but it's only used by the people that work in the 599 building. Everyone else uses the 52nd Street entrance as the main entrance.

This is my favorite Starbucks because the cashiers and baristas are awesome and friendly!, I get good service and they know me by name, even if I sometimes get scare that I have a Starbucks starker it's nice to know they remember you and what you like to order.

They always have seating and people working or just chilling out with their phones. The place is a typical Starbucks's store and my only gripe is that in the summer they have issues with the air conditioning otherwise it my main go to store near my office"
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2016-03-01,1,The worst Starbucks experience ever. They had no brown sugar. They had no napkins. GARBAGE EVERYWHERE. Does anyone work here or nah? This is why I stick to independent coffee roasters.
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2016-02-25,2,"I know, I know.  It's a chain, why have such high hopes?  Well, I've been working across the street for about 6 months, and we often have out of town clients who will ask for Starbucks because why wouldn't they?  And, with each coffee trek I make for them, I think, ""Why can't they be adventurous & try Ground Central?""

I'm saving this place from the dreaded 1-star rating because the baristas are friendly.  And, for my birthday reward, I ordered a grande & the cashier said, ""Wait... you don't want a trenta?""  That was a well done on her part, but sadly my 75 other visits trump this happy memory.

Sometimes, the line will wrap around the entire restaurant, and the 2 employees on duty will continue forth with no sense of urgency.  Sometimes, I will be the only person in line, and I will longingly linger for 3 minutes before someone acknowledges my presence.

Specialty, limited time drinks may be offered nationwide... but that doesn't necessarily mean THIS Starbucks.  They claimed they didn't have the molten lava latte even though it was displayed on their biggest chalkboard.

And, finally, their doors resemble the shed doors in my parents' Pennsylvania backyard.  I'm serious.

I'll save my bucks."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2015-10-12,2,"Him: do you spell it with a ""y"" or an ""i-e""?
Me: it's a latte, not a birth certificate, just make my damn drink!!!

Ugh... U would think since this Starbucks is located in Lexington area..the service and the inside would be nice...nope.. 

Out of all the Starbucks in Lexington this is not a favorite... The frap is over iced...they don't have the shakers with vanilla...chocolate....cinnamon etc..there was only two outlets inside this Starbucks...meh..iv experienced better...."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2015-09-22,3,"Can get very packed, so expect a long line at times. This location is just OK, nothing special about it. 

Tip to management please speed up the time I have to wait for a drink. During off times, the servers sometimes take their sweet time to make patrons' beverages."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2015-07-15,3,"What can you really ask from a Starbucks?  
Im a fellow Starbucks Partner, But I feel like this location lacks a lot of things. For one, a friendly smile. 

The drinks here are very inconsistent, I usually order the same thing but It tastes different when I order here"
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2015-06-26,5,"I go for my guilty pleasure caramel macchiato fix.  What I get in addition is a genuine, fun, and fast customer service experience from the crew.   Those morning lines are long but they make short work of them, fast.   They know my name, and my order,and they keep the energy light and fun.  Shameka, Rashad, Taryn, Jasmine, Tiffany, Nikole, and Chrsitine --Thank you!"
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2015-06-08,3,"It's a Starbucks. It does what it says it will. 

What I will say is that it is a very small space for a busy intersection. Given the number of people, I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the line moved."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2015-03-09,3,"The food and drink quality is the same as most other Starbucks locations.

The staff is friendly, but the service tends to seem slow-could be because 1 person may order drinks for a few people.

It's normally crowded in the front where the line wraps around.

Be careful when opening the front door during the winter months-the door will slam behind you and is often difficult to pry/push open."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2014-08-01,2,Service is mediocre. In the Barista was very rude to customers. I've been to many Starbucks and have not had experienced anything  like this.
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2014-07-08,1,"I don't know what it is about the staff here. Maybe I go too early in the morning and they still need to wake up. In the past year, they have either forgotten my food order, gave me the wrong size drink, or wrong drink entirely at least 10 times! How can you make that many mistakes in a year?! 

I'm usually there around 6:30 or 7am, so the staff is usually the same. Each employee there has probably screwed up my order several times each. And those orange tickets, I've only received one out of all the times I've visited.

I would give them 0 stars if I could. I don't think I'm the only one since I've actually witnessed another customer yelling at the staff there once. At least I've always tried to keep my cool, but this many mistakes is ridiculous!! Please fire the current early morning staff and hire new ones for the sake of customers.

Unfortunately, I since it was the best coffee on the way to work, I still returned. But, I've moved so no more crappy baristas for me!"
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2013-01-26,4,"There are three Starbucks near my new office, and this is the only one that is even worth visiting.  Great staff, a bit of a clusterf**k layout (but that's not their fault), and they're open on weekends.  Love squared."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2012-12-06,3,"Friendly staff and large enough but this place is effin cold. I came in here at 6.30 in the morning to get warm, not to shiver. Two doors on opposite walls create a cross draft that is miserable as it's a busy place."
113,starbucks-new-york-372,2011-09-01,3,"PROS: They serve coffee. Check. They offer the food selections - bistro boxes, baked goods, yogurts, drinks.

CONS: They have a limited selection of teas and chais to buy for your house/work to make on your own. The line can be ridiculous and they haven't yet figured out logistics.

Mixed - Yeah if I pay over $4 for coffee, I like that one free music download a week. Call me cheap. Or call me someone who likes indie bands and thinks it's fun to have a free sample of music that I might listen to for the rest of my life. Point is - they don't always have the cards there and aren't super friendly when you ask for it.

They don't know my name like other locations. And they don't really form a rapport with customers (though they rag on each other all day).

But they serve coffee. And really, what else were you going for?"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2020-07-05,1,This is by far one of the worst Starbucks as I've ever been to. All the employees do is stand around and gossip. I had to wait 45 minutes for my drink and there was no line whatsoever. I would rate it lower than one star if I could.
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2020-01-30,5,"I love going to this Starbucks because it's right next to my doctors office. I always come get my drink here. There is always a small line but they are So fast and efficient here so the line goes by pretty  quick. 

My favorite drink is the Guava Iced tea with a splash of lemonade. Definitely try it out!"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2019-12-21,1,The ladies who work there are really rude. I don't even see any smile on her face. Of course she is no passion on her job. I don't want back.

114,starbucks-new-york-193,2019-10-07,4,"Again. Starbucks is Starbucks. Doesn't change much and yes, we are all it's slave (except the few the warriors the escapees :) )

Overall it's a chill, I like how it is a bit less bright than other ones (could be its positions against building shadows). 

Service is nice and respectful. 

About 5-6 two seater tables. And a long bench with a couple of tables and 3 opposite-to-bench chairs. They also have about 4-5 bar style seats overlooking the street"

Baristas are talking to their friends and drinking their own stuff behind the bar. Hairnets not on gentlemen with long hair.  Not good"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2019-07-13,1,They must have been having a bad day. I got there and there wasn't anyone on the register and then a line formed behind me for the next 5 mins before someone came out. The cashier was rude and I had to repeat my order 5 times because he wasn't paying attention. I used to be a supervisor at a Starbucks and my staff would have never acted like this and this Starbucks wasn't even that busy.
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2019-05-26,4,"Small but very pleasant customer service experience. Grabbed a seat when someone left. Waiting for stores to open. Very convenient to Bloomingdales H&M Magnolia Bakery and more. 
Least expensive coffee $2.23. It's small! I'm just being polite buying something. I'm going to be wired! 
Thanks Starbucks for being open!"

114,starbucks-new-york-193,2019-01-01,3,We wanted the Coffee cake and there was none left. We left instead w some starbucks refresher drink and a bag of starbucks chips. We felt defeated. Service was prompt. This Starbucks could be better stocked
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2018-09-11,2,"Horrible attitudes. I ask for a cup of just ice and I get looked at like I have 3 heads. Water is free but ice is a problem? Idiots. I always make an order and then ask for an extra cup of ice. There is one girl that's always kind when I go in, I forgot her name but shout-out to her. The guy that looks like horatio sans before the weight loss needs to ease up or find a job that doesn't deal with customers LOL."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2018-07-05,1,"Sucky, small, and not friendly. We came in and spent money, hoping to get a liquid refresh and use the bathroom after a long day in the city. They told us after we got our drinks that their bathroom was closed and offered no alternative. They didn't seem to care about our dilemma at ALL. So here we go hopping back on our bikes and now we REALLY have to pee."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2018-06-05,3,I ordered a seasonal strawberry Frappuccino. Only one person knew how to make it and he was sweeping the floor. He shouted out instructions and ingredients to his colleague. I waited nearly 15 minutes to receive it. People came in after me and left before me. It wasn't a good experience.
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2018-04-22,1,"I'm not really one to post negative reviews, but I was disappointed with this starbucks. The only bathroom they have is employee-only and service was substandard. Not much seating available either."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2018-04-16,1,No bathroom for customers? When did Starbucks go from one of the best in customer service to below standard?
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2018-03-04,1,"How does Starbucks lose a customer?  Not let my 13-year old daughter use the restroom after we spent over $30 on beverages.  We were in NYC at the store at 1021 3rd Avenue (between 60th and 61st), meeting a woman and her children for a few minutes, we ordered, sat and chatted for about half an hour or so.  Before getting back in the car for an hour's drive back home, we wanted to use the restroom.  It's there next to the seating area, not behind the counter.  There is a sign on the wall that says ""Rest Room"", a male/female symbol along with the handicap-accessible sign.  They put an ""Employees Only"" sign on the door and a numerical lock.  ""Can my daughter please use the bathroom?""  ""No, it's not a public bathroom.""  We asked for the manager.  He was the one who told us this.  I asked for the area manager and was told ""the area manager knows about this.""  He then suggested we use the bathroom at Chipotle.  So the best he could do was tell me to go to a store I hadn't spent money at and use their facilities.  Ridiculous!  I can see a store limiting use to customers.  I can see not allowing customers to go behind the counter and/or through the prep area, if your bathroom is tucked away like that.  I can't see this.  And, if the bathroom is truly for employees only, remove any sign that indicates it is a bathroom because I'd imaging they'd tell the employee what is really behind that door.  Just dumb on every level.  I don't know the law in NYC or New York State, but I believe if you have a seating area, you need to have bathroom facilities.  I will find that out and report it.  However, I have no need to go to a Starbucks again, certainly not this one."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2018-02-04,1,"One of the worst in Manhattan. The staff here is awful and rude. I've been here a few times in my morning commute and wanted to use the bathroom AFTER making a drink and food purchase. One individual said the bathroom is ""out of order"" another individual another day said ""it's for staff only thia is a small location"". FYI by law any establishment that seats 15+ must have a customer bathroom. The service here is also very slow. Avoid!"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2018-01-21,4,"Kind of a smallish Bux, but don't count it out. It has seating and a restroom. Located on 3rd Ave btwn 60/61, diagonal from the main entrance of Bloomingdales, this might be a nice spot to grab a drink or a snack after the madness of Bloomie's.

There's a ton of shopping over here - so it's nice to have a place to get a reliable coffee and a cookie. Service was fine. Nice and quick. Space was clean and the milks were stocked. I enjoyed my cold brew sitting by a window, overlooking 3rd Ave. Lovely."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2018-01-19,5,I come to this coffee shop pretty often. Nice place with great choice of coffees. My favorite is caramel Macchiato.
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2017-12-20,4,I usually have terrible service at this location but TODAY there were two gentlemen one which was named Frittz I think. Super polite & pleasant. Before they would always mess up orders & when I would mention the error I would get attitude and eyes rolling. NOT NECESSARY just listen next time & correct it and let's move on! + they all look miserable. I've never seen these gentlemen before maybe they are new which is a good thing because old staff was just bad!
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2017-10-04,1,"This is the worst location I've ever been to. I love Starbucks and am a Gold member but the way this shop is run is absurd. First they didn't have soy milk, and I had to wait over 10 minutes for a sandwich & the store wasn't busy. It took me to ask two people (The guy who took my order & the guy who was waiting for something to happen to get my sandwich. This is bullshit."

114,starbucks-new-york-193,2017-08-08,2,Really slow service and the staff ignores you when you come in for a mobile order and it isn't ready. It seems that the Starbucks locations in the UES are all lacking.
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2017-06-22,1,"TERRIBLE!!!! Rude rude rude! They asked me 3 times what my order was. It was 7:00in the morning and only had 2 employees. 1 which was incredibly rude, loud, sighing, and giving some major attitude along with screaming NEXT! Starbucks regional management needs to take a look into this location. It is in one of the prominent locations in New York City on the Upper East Side."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2017-06-18,4,"a decent starbucks on upper east side on 61st st and 3rd ave. it's semi  spacious inside with enough seating for folks and strong wifi to keep people glued to their seats for a while. the usual goodies and hot and cold beverages with sweets and eats displayed easy to see. i love the lemon iced pound cake with a cold mocha frappe while waiting for my buddy. this location seems to have more variety to choice from including paninis and mini cupcakes, etc. at 10am the crowd is growing on a sunday morning so i better grab a comfy seat by the window and enjoy it all before it's packed. staff are quick and friendly and place looks clean and organized with plenty of the starbucks brand items for sale. i am a bit puzzled by some of the other yelpers reviews but i saw nothing here that made me think of anything negative about the place. 3.5 stars on my yelp meter."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2017-05-21,1,"Worst Starbucks ever!!! Management has to look into their employees. The employees are rude, especially, Natalie Rivera. I go to this Starbucks every Sunday. Today I stopped by to purchase something but wanted to use the restroom first. I was rudely told that I couldn't because I'm not a paying customer. No problem. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that the manager, Giselle Perez, was not at the store. As I was walking away, I overheard Natalie talking about me to other employees. Really!?! I won't be buying anything at this Starbucks ever again! After I left the store, I called the store to speak to a manager. James Smith came on the phone and stated that he was a manager. I explained what happened and I also explained that I am a paying customer and have a Starbucks app account that shows the numerous times that I patronize Starbucks and the numerous times that I have been to that particular store. The manager said that maybe Natalie didn't recognize me. This is truly unacceptable behavior for customers to be turned away! We pay your salaries. If we don't come to your store, you don't get paid! You not only lost a purchase, you now lost a customer for life! Corporate will surely hear about this. Nice way to keep customers!"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2017-04-16,2,"Friendly employees, but very dirty (trash overflowing).  Bathroom ""Out of Order,"" all good until I watched Barista use it.  Not cool, when I spend $20 and am here with my wife and three kids."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2017-02-20,2,"This review is about staff member EBONY. 
Ebony was rude from the beginning, she had an attitude and looked like she hated every customer that came in. 
There was no ""hi"", ""please"", ""thank you"", ""what would you like"" words used at all, her tone made me feel uncomfortable and question if I even want that coffee at all. Even if she was having a bad day she shouldn't make customers feel that way when all they wanted is to buy coffee. 
The only reason why I am giving it 2 stars is because the guys that were making our coffees were really nice, but other than that I am not coming back there and I do not think that girl should work in a customer service industry."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2017-02-20,2,"I would never set foot here again because of employee  Ebony. Why even work at these places when you have absolutely no customer service skills. She was not warm and friendly in the least bit and took my order with one word questions. No hi, no thank you, no bye or have a good day. You don't have to be overly bubbly and have convos with every customer but smiling and being polite goes a long way. I gave it 2 stars only bc the guy who made my drink was nice just by saying have a good day with some enthusiasm. Other than that because of Ebony, it is worth 0 stars."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2016-11-29,3,"Disappointing visit to this Starbucks. NO English Breakfast tea and the baristas had an attitude when I asked for a cup of hot water with the banana. I think Starbucks should be a little accommodating when they don't have an item on their menu. 
Finally did get everything and even a seat!"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2016-11-01,1,"No REGULAR sugar, no milk/h&h, has happened 2/3 times I've been here. Awful. Don't go here unless you want what you didn't order."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2016-07-28,1,"Ebony and Matt are the best. It used to be my most favorite place before going to work but ever since they changed the employees most especially the barista, i don't come in here more often anymore. The barista is so rude and doesn't even listen to the customers request. I specifically said very light ice and got my drink and there's a lot of ice. Then the drink is just 3/4 of grande cup???? Just not fair!!! Complain and she will give you a rude comment and take note, she's the slowest barista I've ever met!!! I wished she had a name tag too so we can totally know her. Totally not wearing a name tag at all. There was only 2 customer when I came in and it took me 10 mins for my drink??? Ugh!!! So disappointing. Please bring back the friendly employees here."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2016-03-19,3,It's a Starbucks. You get a seat if you're lucky. Sometimes the line is too long. What more can you say?
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2016-03-15,5,"The nicest Starbucks employees work here!! HG (holy grail) Starbucks of NYC. I came here after I felt very flustered from my workout at Earth Yoga. The cashier (his name is Matthew I believe) respected and cheerfully greeted each and every customer that came in. He also asked how I spelt my name. He also ended the transaction with a, ""Thank you for choosing Starbucks."" And a smile. I know it's something so small but I appreciated these small kind gestures. For reference I came here on a Tuesday at 1pm. The young man preparing the drinks asked me for specifics, ""would you like more ice in your iced coffee?"" 

Why aren't all Starbucks like this?!"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2016-03-13,4,Convenient and staff friendly. They get very busy but still took the time to remake my complicated drink (I wanted the iced version but got the hot version) without complaints.
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2016-02-12,1,"Literally the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. It's almost as if this chain aspires to hire the worst, rudest and most apathetic staff that they can find. Service is horrible even for someone who has been going to the same location for 6 months trying to make it work. Today was my last day. Definitely go here if you want an eclectic group of baristas who could care less about your order and intentionally give you the opposite of what you wanted."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2015-12-16,5,"Premium location for this Starbucks conveniently located a short walk from Bloomingdale's, free wifi for customers, plenty of electrical outlets for electronics, clean bathroom, etc."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2015-12-10,4,"Not the cleanest Starbucks I've been to but it does what I need it to do- give me coffeeee!  I remember one time their credit card machine wasn't working in the afternoon so I got a free coffee!

This Starbucks is located right by the entrance/exit of the 60th Street exit of the NQR Lexington Ave subway station.  It's convenient and more of a ""take your coffee and run"" kind of place.  There's VERY limited seating and gets pretty loud in here."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2015-11-30,2,"Kinda dirty and uninspired, with not a lot of seating. Same ol' coffee products!"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2015-11-21,5,"The baristas here are always so polite and friendly. Especially Matthew, I see him make an extra effort to be friendly and engage individually with so many customers, including myself, and it makes this big city feel like an actual community! Every store needs more people like
Him!"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2015-10-01,1,"Rude staff. Also, the store doesn't open on time. Went to grab a drink at 6:20am on a Thursday and door was locked. No signs saying why they were closed during normal business hours. Very frustrating."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2015-07-18,1,Searched my cell for closest Starbucks. Saw review average 2.5 stars. Thought 'this can't be'. Hardly ever had a bad experience at any Starbucks. Upshot: RUDE STAFF!
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2015-07-16,1,"Ass crack first thing in the morning? Totally not what I ordered. Just to echo what others have already mentioned, rude staff, miscommunication, lack of basic condiments, filthy, but the young lady preparing bagels, etc. this morning was a fan on the whole ""prison pants"" look aka let my boxers hang out as I  bend over to perform simple tasks because I can't be bothered to put on a belt. Just horrible, who lets their staff come to work like this? Who thinks this is an appropriate way to come to work?"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2015-01-12,1,"The girl working here on Monday evening around 9pm, wears glasses needs to be fired!!! Yelling and carrying on like crazy when her friends come in the door. Unprofessional to say the least."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2015-01-03,2,"it's just a Starbucks right? 

Well this one in particular is very dysfunctional. I don't know if it's the employees who always change so I don't base my reviews usually off them, or the location. 

This place is always dirty by noon and lacking things like clean condiments for my coffee (ie vanilla powder is caked at the pouring end and that's kind of gross). The floor is already stained. The drinks are handed to you half full on occasion. The disgruntled employee who gives me my breakfast sandwich (which is cold in the middle) also has yelled at me before for cutting the line when I was also waiting for,
a breakfast sandwich.

Save your money for another Starbucks. Or deal with the above if this is convienent as I am doing on occasion."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2014-12-17,1,"If there were a grade lower than 1 star, they'd get it. Frequent this Starbucks at least once a week traveling for work and am more disappointed every time I visit. Sitting for even 10 minutes scarfing down a protein box and a double espresso, I witnessed more than a handful of miscommunications, mis-made orders and listened to the obnoxious barista rifle off drinks ready for pick up and proceed to wave people away from the top of her machine as she was seemingly to lazy to walk the drinks down to the serving counter as she should. 

The lack of service overall and presentation of this entire staff leaves something to be desired and I am always amazed at how inconsistent this branch is with delivering whatever it is you claim to be the 'Starbucks  Experience' anymore. 

Yet another place in NYC I'm forced to patronize because of proximity and convenience, but whoever is ""running"" this establishment should put some time into turning it around, which would probably consist of hiring an entirely new staff, for starters."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2014-12-07,1,"Why do i get an attitude when you made my order wrong, then i  get to wait all over again, while they talk to eachother not the customers, maybe if you paid more attention to customers you  would have made the order correctly."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2014-10-28,1,"Like many Starbucks in the city, there's no place for paying customers to sit because people who never purchased a single product take up all the tables, sitting and using the free internet. Unlike other Starbucks, though, the management here doesn't even care that these non-customers taking up the seating blare their music without headphones and even smoke in the store!"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2014-10-13,1,Texting while having a long line is not cool.   Then you use your hands to wave me forward.  To be chubby and have a bad manner is not good!!!!  I wasn't a dog.
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2014-09-27,4,"Usually long lines, but baristas are nice.  Sort of a long, awkward set up which makes the lines go out the door sometimes.  But, very convenient location and nice people."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2014-09-19,2,Incompetent staff with a terrible attitude. They are really understaffed at this location. Walk to the one on Lex and 63. It's way better.
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2014-09-15,2,On of the worst locations for Starbucks.  It's a busy location considering it's proximity to Bloomies.  They only have 3 people working on Sat afternoon.  Line was barely moving.  I saw people left frustrated.  And I heard the workers complaining about how they are short staffed in front of customers. How about stop complaining and chit chatting and focus on the task at hand!  Ugh.
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2014-05-28,3,Probably one of the most sketchy Starbucks I've ever been to. The staffs were very friendly but unorganized. Glad I was eyeing on my drink while they were making it... otherwise I would gotten a hot latte instead of a nice cold frappuccino...
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2014-01-11,4,"Going to Starbucks is not an experience that often surprises me, but this one managed to do just that.  It was a cold day as I ran in hoping to get a nice chai latte with an espresso shot.  

Surprise #1: When I said ""Venti Chai Latte Skim Dirty"" she didn't blink and say ""What is that?"" (you'd be amazed how many times this has happend).

Surprise #2: I had barely made it over to the end of the counter and the drink was already good to go.  The barista was even fast enough to put the cardboard ""ring"" in the cup for me (something other branches have had me do myself lately, I don't mind I was just surprised).

On top of this kudos to the staff for keeping a nice, clean shop.

Well worth a visit!"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2014-01-08,2,"900th review--Starbucks FTW! I wish I had kinder things to offer, but the best thing I can say about this location is that it exists. So, if you are very close, and need a cup of coffee, and enjoy or at least don't mind Starbucks, it IS an option.

The staff here would very clearly rather be anywhere else, and while they're not outright rude (and one or two baristas may actually use words in replying to you), you do feel like they're doing you a favor by fulfilling your order in a reasonable manner.

Out of necessity, I've been here twice in the past month, and am at risk for ending up here again in 2014. If a better coffee option exists within a 2-block radius, I'm not aware of it. Suggestions are welcome."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2014-01-02,4,It's Starbucks! Nothing negative to say about it as long as they move quickly. The coffee is always good. The food is always mediocre. Stick with the drinks and go elsewhere for a bite to eat. This location is no different. It's always busy but they are pretty good about getting you on and out.
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2013-12-03,4,"I like this Starbucks. It's on the way to my office so is a convenient stop to make - particularly in these cold days made warmer by gingerbread lattes yum :) Yes it's small so it is not really a place to hang out or work for long but I have found all the staff to be friendly and efficient. Today the barista was not 100% happy with the aforementioned latte he had just made, so he discarded it, upsized me and gave me a voucher for a freebie in the future. They have also accommodated more unusual requests for me too i.e. the big traveler boxes with patience and good grace. No complaints here."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2013-08-24,3,"Nothing special about this place; a Starbucks is a Starbucks. I frequently come here on weekends though, because its next to my dog groomers, so it's the perfect place to wait. This particular location is quite small though; not nearly enough seating."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2013-08-18,2,Overpriced acidic bitter coffee. Staff can't make a decent espresso even with those expensive machines from Italy .
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2013-08-05,3,"Starbucks are pretty much a staple of Manhattan life nowadays.

Well, NYC life in general because we do have them in the boroughs as well.

Service was good except the tall black guy behind the cashier (there were 3 working that day but to be more specific the guy that resembles MOST like Kid Cudi) forgot to give me my treat receipt.

No biggie except this was probably the only reason I would buy Starbucks this early in the morning on a weekend in the Upper East Side during this month's promotion.

I had to ask for the receipt after his attention fell to the next customer.

Does this mean I get my drink for free?

I really should have pushed for this.

The girl making the drink on the other hand was proficient as was nice.  

Must have been my morning swagger.

I ordered the Java Chip Frap for the first time and it came out as I expected it.

There is a bathroom (1) at this location.

Seating is still limited.

But when you need some cocoa in your system, go for Starbucks."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2013-05-28,3,"While this isn't the best Starbucks I've been to, I don't think it deserves some of the harsh reviews that it's received. For one of the busiest locations I've ever been to, it's run pretty well!

I get out at the 59th and Lexington stop every morning and on those days when I desperately need a pick-me-up, this Starbucks is my usual spot. The line is usually long and weaves through patrons, but this is what you have to work with in NYC, especially in a small location like this. Despite the cramped quarters and the long line, they flush people out pretty quickly. On the busiest day, I've never waited there longer than seven minutes or so. They are incredibly efficient, especially for the volume of customers that they receive.

If you're not running late or don't mind the tight accommodations, this is a great, convenient Starbucks to go to. Don't let the long line intimidate you, either! I promise it moves quickly."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2013-04-03,5,"Best staff, Quick and  Clean. I come here every morning to get my morning dosage of caffeine before work. The staff is supper friendly and  know my name and order and the names of the morning regulars as well. This location is a bit smaller then the others not a place to read the paper or  to do work on your laptop. It's more of a place to pick up, refuel and go."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2012-07-18,1,"Hands down the worst Starbucks I've been to. Every few weeks I give them another chance, hoping maybe the employees have turned over, but nope. Still awful.

Generally just very very slow. In the morning, they have a rhythm, which works as long as you don't have any change requests. Three days in a row, I asked for light on the ice (the iced coffee is already cold. I don't need a cup full of ice. I offered to pay for a bigger size). Every time they gave me a normal cup full of ice and a shot of iced coffee. OK.. my bad for expecting personalized experience in a fast food restaurant. Yet when I go to other locations, they are more than happy to accommodate me (shout out to 3rd ave and ..83rd-ish street).

This afternoon I found myself nearby, and thought I'd order a frapp to treat myself.  I walked in and watched the cashier, wearing ripped clothes mind you, chat with the customers before me in line.. took about 5 minutes to get up to her, behind just 2 people.  When she finally took my order, casually, there was still a line of about 10 ppl behind me.  This is the moment that the one barista chose to clean her whole station, while the orders piled up.

As she casually wiped, and 3 minutes later finally started assembling my drink, she continues talking to the cashier.. asking what everyone's drinks were again, personal chatter, etc.. she pauses between steps of my drink a good 30 seconds each time, my cup in hand. Now it's been TEN minutes since i walked in the door... 

I had to ask for a refund, which took another 2 minutes to do.  I've never had to do that. And now I don't get my caffeine fix for the work night. Boo to them. Never again."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2012-07-17,3,"Decent location.  A bit short on seating.  But it's spread throughout the store, which helps avoid that mass-seating, cramped 'Bucks/NYC thing.  The bathroom was relatively clean.  No good place to stand in line for that without being in people's way.  But such is life in NYC.  The staff were efficient enough.  Nothing memorable either way.  Though it was a little off-putting when I told one of the baristas that the bathroom was out of soap.  She said, ""Ok."", looked around, said, ""I don't know what to do.  The manager's not around."" and went back to whatever prep work she was doing.

But hey.  Carry hand sanitizer around and you'll be fine :-)"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2012-05-22,2,Your basic Starbucks.  A little small but that's Manhattan for you.
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2011-11-04,4,"This Starbucks is nothing special, but I'm giving it four stars for the employees and what they have to put up with. Yes, they occasionally get orders wrong, but the space is horribly laid out and cramped and it gets confusing FAST. I think the employees make a concerted effort to stay on top of things, and even have a head-set system to help communicate orders to one-another. 

 When I hear the crazy ish some of the snotty UES customers ask for I can't help but roll my eyes. ""give me one shot of espresso with two tea bags filled halfway with steamed soy milk and the other half with steamed skim, and I want a grande but in a venti cup"" UGH. I would never make it working at this Starbucks as I would be arrested for assault in under a day. The fact that the employees I've met here in this past year are always polite and smiling is nothing short of miraculous."

114,starbucks-new-york-193,2011-02-13,3,"This is an OK Starbucks. A lot more outlets than some other Starbucks. The music is louder than other Starbucks. Service was a little slow, but they did have a lot of customers and only one barista. 
What I like about this Starbucks is that most of the tables are situated such that it is not in the way of the wind that comes in when the door opens. Yay for temperature control!"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2010-08-09,2,"Hate it.  

These people think they are working at a NY deli.  Starbucks is not a NY deli.  

Nothing irritates me more than someone yelling out ""next!"" or trying to take my order with their backs turned to me.  Give me a break.

All I want is to get a coffee in the morning without being annoyed"
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2010-05-26,2,"Yesterday, after going to Williams-Sonoma and picking up two $14 boxed cake mixes, Keavy said she wanted to stop in Starbuck's ""for a coffee drink!"".  Now, Keavy's a new friend, and this was an unusual activity for me.  I don't really drink coffee.
But I thought hey why not.  So I order some medium-sized something or other and then the cashier asked for four dollars and 94 cents.

I will not give this crap any room in my budget.  At all.  Ever again.

Then we drove to Queens by accident."
114,starbucks-new-york-193,2009-07-12,3,"I stop by this Starbucks before Bastille Day on 60th Street event started. There were actually only one employee making coffee and working. I saw another employee getting out of employee only room and walking out from the store. At the moment, 5 or 6 people lined up in front of checkout counter, and the only working employee couldn't take orders. A few minutes later, she called some other employees for help, and finally the line got shorter. huh!

I ordered a tall coffee Frappuccino, and the hard-working employee kindly took my order. I had a sofa seat with a table. The sofa was kinda old, I actually saw a but-print on it. It was too deep, so I thought someone previously sitting there just left. When I sat there, I felt the deepness, the age of the sofa. lol (My point is that they should invest on their equipment like a sofa!)

This place wasn't noisy at all. Actually very comfortable and calm. It's a good place to read a book or a magazine. (and yes I read my magazine there for about an hour.)"

115,starbucks-new-york-188,2019-11-10,1,"I normally don't write negative reviews; moreover, I normally don't write reviews for chains but this particular Starbucks location needs to either hire more competent workers or close down permanently. I never thought I'd write a review for a chain like Starbucks but here we go: 

I came to this location for the first time and encountered so many issues in 1-hour span: 
1) My iced caramel macchiato tasted like very bad iced americano. How can someone mess this drink up? I had to ask for additional pump and caramel drizzle, yet it still tasted horrible and went straight to trash (and I rarely trash anything). 
2) The same barista (name's Derek) who messed up my drink now became a cashier. I didn't really want to talk to him; hence placed a mobile order and ordered egg white bites. On the app, it said to wait 5 minutes which was totally fine since I was on conference call anyways. Then 10 minutes passed...15 minutes...20 minutes. I checked the status of my order via app, then my order status was gone..asked Derek about my order and his reply was: ""Oh, we ran out of egg bites, is there anything I can get for you?"" Okay, I waited over 20 minutes and you just tried to cancel my order that I already pre-paid for? 
3) Before even talking to Derek about my missing order, I talked with a female employee there. I showed her my app and she was just so confused with everything; her reply was this: ""I don't know what that is, I don't know what you're talking about--DEREKKK!!"" 
4) None of their charging stations worked. Please have that fixed since there aren't many visible outlets. 

Overall, dirty location with rude staff and extremely slow service. Avoid this particular establishment as there's another one at the corner of 49th and 8th."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2019-08-16,2,"Near World Wide Urban Plaza on corner 49th and 8th Avenue. 
Like weeds, one of many. Limited or no seating. 
Found it difficult to communicate with 2 different workers when ordering. They did not have the light coffee I ordered, only the Peak. I did not order. Friend got a hot green tea latte and was ok with it. I was unsure if the prices were the same as other Starbucks or perhaps higher due to the location in the City. 
 I stopped in to their bathroom. Wrong move. Yuck. (see pix) 
As there are other Starbucks nearby and, in passing I came across another nearby park with a different coffeehouse that looked very nice, next time I plan to visit that one instead."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2019-08-06,4,This Starbucks is close the where I live so it's a go to place for me to get coffee and the worker's are really but alot of times they spell my name incorrectly even when I spelled it out for them
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2019-03-11,3,Not enough comfortable seating an the place is kind of dirty other peoples trash everywhere And the barista's are too busy talking!
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2019-02-18,5,"Super sweet woman at the front. Bathroom accessible. Great hot chocolate. Normally people at these places push you around, not this one."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2018-06-19,1,"I've been in this location for very long time and believe or not, I will never return back to this location again. I lost a lot of respect and could've lose patient with the employee there because I have no idea what's going on with one of them. I was with my mom to order a coffee and refresher then all of the sudden, we met one of the rudest employee who gave us an attitude and misheard our orders. When we order our drinks, All she kept repeating was, ""what? Speak louder!"". With a harsh tone. Then she had the audacity to roll her eyes and sigh. Like I was wondering, what did we do to her? As we got our orders, I realize that she made a wrong drink for my mom because unfortunately, she didn't repeat to us the order before we pay. Also, I thought she knew our orders correctly. To me, I find that really unprofessional for her to act like this in her job. When we said to her, we didn't order this drink in a kind way. All of the sudden, she starts sucking her teeth loudly, coming towards me and snatched the drink out of hand as she sighs and roll her eyes. I don't appreciate that type of behavior for customer service. Then as she began to work my mom's drink that she got wrong, she had the nerve to bang on a lot of stuff and all of the water splash on me and my mom. As I saw the water splash on the floor and towards people, how does people react to that type of behavior? Also, people could've slipped. Then again, she didn't apologize at all. As she finish making the drink, she didn't call out the order and just continue banging the finish drink on the table towards me. I had enough. I did confront her with few words to make her understand that, she's behaving inappropriately for customer service and there's kids around her too. I don't want the kids to think it's okay to act like this towards people and how it could affect their careers and future. Like everybody does have a bad day and putting it towards people is not a good solution. If you don't like your job, then don't work there. Then she process to mumble nasty words behind me and I could hear it. I didn't say anything but leave with my mom and just to remember, we are not coming back. But in the end, I realize that our drinks were not properly done well. We get less amount of drinks and we paid a lot of money for this amount. Also, I did observe how she made our drinks too, it was done improperly than other locations that I've been to. Not sanitary and unprofessional."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2018-05-26,1,"food made me sick happened to be expired but that was just the beginning it is a racist starbucks im appalled by the rude behavior and disgusted by the store here in midtown, extremely dirty! mold inside the ice machine, old cheesy milk in the milk carafe, hoping a manager can make it better that was a fail! eric the manager his attitude is disgusting the district manager isn't any better! you would think a manager or district manager would know how to run a store but nooo!"
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2018-05-13,1,Avoid! Staff were extremely rude and one complained I was in her way?? Filthy tables and floor. They didn't know how to make my drink. I was about done with Starbucks and this experience was the last nail in the coffin.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2018-04-27,1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!  This place has NO CLUE how to serve people.  The worst Starbucks in the Staten!!!!
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2018-04-08,3,They rarely open on time.  The short manly looking women and her name is Paulo that works the early shift has to be one of the rudest people I've ever met at a Starbucks.  I called and complained to her District Manager last month and she still opens late and isn't any friendlier.  This is the only reason I am giving 3 is because of her.  Once she moves on I will change it to a 5 because everyone else is very friendly.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2018-01-28,2,Not the best Starbucks.  Place was dirty.  Service was slow.  Told woman named Jodannah the floor and sugar bar was dirty and she looked annoyed that I mentioned it.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2017-11-07,5,I rarely give 5 stars to a Chain Coffee House but this is by far my favorite location.   Great place to work and lots of seating and outlets!
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2017-11-05,2,"I like to order my morning coffee here and pick it up on my way to work. It has come to me a couple of times that they not only don't give you a full cup of latte (I ordered Venti most of the time), even worse, most of the time, it's only half a cup. Ironically I ordered a grande today and also got half a cup. Someone's measurement seems to be off."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2017-08-31,3,"There is another starbucks at the corner of 49th and 8th. Somehow, this one feels a bit busier, and it is constantly backed up, so be sure to order online beforehand if you can. Just like most Starbucks locations in New York, there is little room to sit down.

The service is on par with most other Starbucks. However, because the order is constantly backed up, not the ideal location for a quick grab and go."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2017-05-08,1,Ordered an espresso frappe with affogato shot first one tasted like it was blended milk and when I asked to have it remade I was given an attitude without an apology. Drink was remade but still was horrible. $8 drink that went straight to the trash. I miss the west coast where Starbucks was made the right way and at least when you walk into a Starbucks you know you're going to deal with true coffee lovers unlike these convicts looking employees here! People like that give Starbucks a bad reputation and belong at dunkins.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2017-04-17,5,"Really liked this store! Unlike the one at the 47th street, the staff who was here was welcoming and friendly, we did enjoy our stay at this restaurant"
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2017-03-02,1,"I've been biting my tongue about this location for quite some time. They might be the slowest moving baristas I've ever witnessed. They do not care at all if you're in a hurry or you put a mobile order in before you left your apartment and it's still not ready. They WILL make you miss your train, which now won't be here for another ten minutes. And they WONT care one bit about it. I've been going here since September 2016 pretty much every morning (it's a block from my apt on the way to the C) and it's the same staff each day. They still look at me like I'm a complete stranger who has never placed a mobile order or a Starbucks order in my life. I've never heard a ""good morning"" or ""thank you"" or ""have a good day."" 

D-Squared coffee, the new local place that just opened up under my apartments one block away, is already stealing all of their business and I couldn't be happier. As soon as I'm out of my Christmas gift cards, I won't be back to this Starbucks. If you don't feel like wasting your money, I suggest you walk to 49th and 9th and try a local spot instead of these self indulgent ""baristas."""
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2017-02-24,1,"No decaf coffee. Won't make it, won't serve it, won't give you a decaf americano for the same price. You're outta luck. Derrick said sorry bye. Useless staff and rude."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2016-12-12,1,Poor customer service skill. Didnt ask for sizs of drink n just assume. Poor attitude when ask to switch. Not recommended
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2016-12-07,5,"I never pictured myself writing a review for a chain like Starbucks on a platform like Yelp, but damn this location is impressive. When I go into a Starbucks, I'm looking for a few things: a quick moving line, polite staff, and my order to be correct. 

Came here around 9 on a Wednesday morning, and the place was packed! The line was moving quickly (woohoo!) and the person who took my order was attentive/knew exactly what I wanted. My order isn't complicated, but if you have ever had your drink messed up you know how much it sucks. 

The staff was super upbeat and energetic, as the woman handling the food was calling out and making sure everyone was taken care of. 

Drink was perfect - I left happy."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2016-11-23,2,Either my taste buds are shot or I paid 4.50 for hot water. The gingerbread man refused to jump in.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2016-08-18,1,"Didn't appreciate the attitude from the short guy with the beard, Erik just saw his name tag.  I asked for a receipt and was told I couldn't get one . The paper seemed to be jammed and well he was not trying to make it work. And 3 baristas and such slow service."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2016-03-18,1,"I wish I could give a lower rating as it doesn't even deserve a 1 star  we stopped in hear for a coffee an a sandwich before the st Patrick's day parade. We had the unfortunate encounter with an extremely ignorant man working at the till he was a bald white male that thought making us fell stupid was funny. He yelled at my elderly father that is 62 and from Ireland so not used to Starbucks to hurry up with his order, he also shouted at us and laughed with his co worker because he shouted and embarrassed us. I no a job is a job but for someone working in Starbucks to try a belittle some one is a bit rich"
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2015-12-09,5,"Efficient service at this Starbucks, free wifi for customers, a lot of electric plugs, clean bathrooms with a changing table for babies, etc."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2015-12-07,3,"It's a standard Starbucks in terms of the service and products. They sell the NYC specific mugs, which is pretty cool. My coffee was fine. 

Because of its proximity to Times Square and the Theater District, the crowd here is...interesting. Not a place to do work. Seating is also quite limited, so don't always expect a place to rest your legs."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2015-11-14,5,I went to this location 2 times during my visit to NYC. The staff was friendly and professional and the store was clean. I was able to recharge my phone using one of their charging stations which is a plus. Its just far enough to be off the beaten path of the square. A nice location to have a drink and relax for a minute.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2015-09-10,4,This is generally my go-to Starbucks when I am in the city. Always consistent service and always clean.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2015-08-11,1,I don't know why I had to wait 10 minutes for coffee cream while the guy cleaned the cream station. Bad attitudes.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2015-07-25,1,"Starbucks, you've got to be kidding.

I went there on Friday 7/24/15 at about 9 PM. The chairs were up and a yellow cone was placed in front of the door on the inside, to make it look like they were closed. I double-checked the store hours sigh. It said that they were supposed to be open till10. I gingerly opened the door, stepped around the yellow cone; noted one guy seated amidst all the subbed floors and upturned tables, noted the staffers moving pastries back to the storage area, and asked a staff member (team member?) who eventually (not quickly) came to the counter to meet me ""Are you closing early tonight?"" He said ""No, we close at 10."" Meanwhile, another customer who walked in behind me blurted out ""You mean at 10 you lock the doors and leave."" The Starbucks guy didn't answer.

This is not the first time I found Starbucks closing shift employees trying to discourage customers from coming in during the final hour of business. Actually, it seems to be an epidemic among the NY area stores (they seem friendlier outside NY). But this was the worst. Check the photos i posted. thew really worked hard to crete among bypasses the impression that they were closed: at 9 PM, one hour before closing.

I don't know if this is on the employees, on the store manager, a regional manager or all of the above. But I will be communicating this to the Starbucks HQ in Seattle because this hatred-for-cnstoemnrs seems very inconsistent with the brand Starbucks seeks to maintain.  If they want to stat in the NY market, they need to get serious about story operations and start firing some people."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2015-06-06,3,Never enough seating here. And service is hit or miss. But you'll get what you expect from Starbucks coffee.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2014-12-19,3,"Standard NYC Starbucks.  Nice staff & decently clean, however the wifi is agonizingly slow."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2014-11-30,4,"The Worldwide Plaza Starbucks has the friendliest staff of all the Hell's Kitchen Starbucks locations. And there sure are a lot of them.

Wi-Fi's solid, and the coffee is your typical Starbucks. There's enough seating for a rugby team, which explains why there's always folks here with laptops (including me)."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2014-10-23,4,"I came in here for some hot tea on a cold and rainy afternoon. I typically never go to Starbucks, but I had a gift card and needed a warm seat. Anyway, I wanted decaf tea, but they were out! It's pretty surprising that a busy Starbucks in Times Square would be out of 4 different types of tea. At least the barista was really nice about it and offered me the tea with the least amount of caffeine."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2014-10-08,2,Worst wifi ever and the entire Starbucks has 2 visible outlets.  Not a place to work.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2014-09-12,4,"I mean its Starbucks--pretty consistent across the board in my opinion.  Nothing spectacular, nothing horrible.  It's just...Starbucks.  lol"
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2014-06-01,1,"I waited in line forever and they got my order all wrong! 

They messed up my egg sandwich and forgot my coffee.

115,starbucks-new-york-188,2014-06-01,1,We've been in New York for three days now from California and have had the most pleasant experiences everyone has been so nice and helpful. Until visiting this Starbucks location where this barista Daisy had a rude unpleasant attitude. I asked for a sleeve for my hot latte she said it's right there I told her the container we was empty she then said you have to go get it over there then. When I think of Starbucks I think of the comfort of home it's a place I visit in an everyday basis but definitely WILL NOT come back to this one.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2014-06-01,1,Super rude employee said her name was daisy . Was not wearing a name tag .Short fat Latin girl in her 20's possibly 30s hard to tell long hair in a pony tail thu a hat . Asked for a sleeve to for the hot coffee because they were out . She responded with a very rude answer and smirked when I asked for her name to talk to a manager . Apparently there was no manager in duty which I doubt.  I hope corporate sees this review and sends a secret shopper.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2014-05-22,2,This was my first time experiencing a Starbucks that had run out of half and half. Wow.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2014-05-22,3,"It's starbucks. The coffee will never really taste any differently so if you like starbucks in terms of quality, you should be pleased. I'm not the biggest fan of starbucks, but I'm new to this area and every other coffee shop is too small to fit many people in it... I was looking to sit down with some coffee and do some work on my computer; starbucks it was. 

The coffee was fine. Nothing special. It was really busy -- to be expected at 8am -- and they kept the line moving very quickly. bravo. The wifi sucks. So so so slow -- although it did pick up a bit after an hour or so, why? No clue. 

I will say, if you want a quiet or semi-quiet place to work this is not it. Even after the crowd had pretty much left (which is not really the loud part) the baristas were all sorts of noisy. Singing and yelling amongst each other -- I'm really glad you're enjoying your job, I am. But sucks for me. That's probably my only complaint... other than it's a starbucks and there are a few really great coffee shops just around the corner that serve coffee eons better quality than starbucks. They don't however offer much seating space so if you want coffee and a place to sit, this is your spot -- just expect the atmosphere to be very rambunctious."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2014-03-20,4,"This is my go to Starbucks, near my office. There's another one around the plaza, but I like the baristas here more. They are so pleasant and accommodating. I never have to wait long for my drink or food."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2013-09-16,1,"It's shame the place is run like this.  Any Given time places Is disgusting.  The freezer where sandwiches and coffee cakes are all disgusting.   The bathroom are gross.  Counters are never playing.  The manager of the places morbidly obese he's always looks He needs a good shower.
It's hard to believe somebody can get away with running up and establishment like this! Clearly no district managers ever stop by."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2013-06-06,3,"Although I enjoy a good espresso, I love my morning fix from SB ""Grand, 5 shot, skim, no wipe, white mocha"" 
Great staff & love the world plaza setting outside 
But if you have a complicated order like mine make sure they get it right"
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2013-05-18,5,"This store is pretty laid-back considering it is in NYC. Most customers are from neighborhood. The baristas are all so helpful, and nice. Usually there is no line, or 2 or 3 people waiting the most. I like the vibe in this Starbucks. I can say the service is definitely one of the best among all Starbucks in the city."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2013-03-18,3,"Average Starbucks quality food and drink. Girl forgot to give me my cake pop I ordered, so I asked for it again. No biggie. Wish there was more seating. It always seems to be full of people."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2013-02-10,3,"I can order my usual chai tea latte. Staff is friendly. But for such a large location, they do not have enough seats. That should be reconsidered."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2012-05-07,1,I would never recommend this place to anyone. The people who work here are so rude and unprofessional. They seem as if they are miserable there and are not social. I had to ask for my money back because they took forever to finish my drink
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2011-12-21,4,"Not all Starbucks are created equal.  I agree with previous reviewers - this is easily the best Starbucks in the city, and I'm lucky to have it a few doors down from my work!

How many times have I stumbled into this Starbucks, 10 hours into a 16-hour day, ordered my iced venti red-eye, and the barista looked at me and wordlessly added an extra shot of espresso into my drink?  So much love.  They get me.

The lines can be long, especially when the tour buses of theatergoers are around, but I've never waited long; they're quite efficient here.

My only beef - hence why this location gets four stars - is that they don't have a toaster, so you can't order any breakfast sandwiches, or even get your bagel toasted.  This is super lame, as it forces me to go to the Sbux on the corner of 49th and 8th where they are blessed with the elusive toaster oven, and that location is as bad as this location is awesome.

I realize that it's sacrilegious, in a way, to eat at Starbucks when NYC has so many fantastic delis and coffee shops.  But damn it, sometimes I just want the same skinny peppermint mocha and a spinach, egg, and feta wrap that I devoured throughout high school and college.  It's comfort food, people.   Don't hate."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2011-09-12,5,"by far and away the best starbucks in the city.  and because its the best sbux in the city, it gets 5 stars.  best of the best, baby!

i am a studying nomad.  i've even disappeared off the face of the yelp-world for a good 6 months because of it.  any sort of licensing exam is apparently no joke.  my lifes ambition for these 6 months was to find a good study spot.  this led me to scouring the city from starbucks to starbucks and lo and behold the best one was right in my backyard.  

the service is uh-mayzing.  it's the go-above-and-beyond kind.  it makes you feel good every time you're in there. 

seating - so much of it and for some reason, this particular one has pretty good turn around time.

no weirdos.  it sounds weird but for some reason at almost every other starbucks i've set up camp.. there's without fail some kind of weirdo.  cmon people!  creepers and weirdos please.stay.home.

drinks - yeah, i mean.. they do it right every time.  i dont think they've ever gotten my order wrong or twisted or confused - perfect over and over.  

its just a good place.  a good starbucks.  this is strangely hard to come by - but this one has totally managed."
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2008-05-04,4,Outside garden area is pleasant in good weather.
115,starbucks-new-york-188,2006-01-02,5,"To you & the rest of the world, this is just another Starbucks. They're all the same, with their pretentious sizing & dry pastries. To me, this particular Starbucks was the center of my world for 3 years. The site of countless confessionals, gossip mongering, and strategizing sessions. A place where my friends & I could skip class without fear of being picked up by truancy cops. A place where we would make up countless stories of all the strangers around us (I wonder if the ""surrealists"" are still there?). The birthplace of hundreds of inside jokes; a  little mecca away from the prison-like high school we went to."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2020-07-13,5,"I came here a few weeks ago and loved how they operated and seemed squeaky clean. It was only two staff members and you order right when you step in since they closed off all the sitting space. They asked what I would like and started making my beverage right away and the cashier put in front of me a tray to place my credit card on. I don't know why, but I was pretty impressed with this kind of service since no other place or no other starbucks has done this. I placed my card on there and she took it to the machine to process the payment. She then brought it back to me the same way I gave it. I also loved their energy; very positive and friendly. I would definitely recommend this Starbucks if you're in the area. 

Another thing about this place.. I remember coming here during the winter, beginning of this year, and they had a wall full of post-its that had notes on act of kindness which I loved! See the photo I attached here- pretty cool!

This is one of the best Starbucks I've experienced and will continue to support this one! 

Drinks I recommend that are perfect for summer and quench your thirst: dragonfruit lemonade, green tea lemonade, guava white tea lemonade, guava white tea; all iced! And of course.. you can never go wrong with a classic iced black coffee! :)"
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2020-01-12,5,"It seems like there is a starbucks at every corner in NY, which is a good thing since I love coffee. We were in town visiting and stopped by for a coffee to warm up on a cold winter morning. Customer service was great, line moved quick and my beverage was prepared well."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2019-11-15,5,"Great service compared to the one on 6th.  The person behind counter was very helpful.   Other than that it's a typical Starbucks. 

Not much seating.   But beautiful morning light coming through and a definite NYC hot location."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2019-07-27,1,"Unfortunately I go to Starbucks almost every morning, what can I say, I'm addicted. I have never reviewed a Starbucks nor have I ever felt the need to. They have all been pretty similar to me and only every once in a while has something been a little off. This location, everything seems off. Been here 4 mornings in a row and drink hasn't been right once. In addition the gentlemen taking the order and who made my drink (same guy) had a horrible attitude. Definitely shouldn't be in a customer facing job. 

Starbucks, you need to send a secret shopper to this one."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2019-07-11,2,"Barista (young girl) gave me my tall matcha latte fizzing out of the cup. I asked her if she had something to wipe it down & she pointed me in the direction of the napkins at the self serve bar. It was empty, right before the mid afternoon rush & she gave me my drink in a nasty manner."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2019-06-14,2,Very poor experience. I ordered a chocolate croissant. That's it. After five minutes I still didn't have it despite staff seemingly having the time. I guess it makes sense that I had to wait in line but the croissant was right next to the guy who served me. Just grab it quick and reduce the time for everyone else! I was gonna be late for my meeting so got a refund and left.
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2019-03-23,1,"Probably the worst Starbucks ever. Cashier looks like shes having a bad day, never got a single smile from her. I asked her to heat my food but she declined said it's not possible. Totally understand if it cant be heated but dont I deserve a simple smile or a bit of friendliness? She had very poor customer service. Didnt even ask if I wanted a drink to go with the food. Slammed the cash register box and gave me my change right away and turned her back afterwards."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2019-02-18,3,"This was the closest Starbucks/coffee shop to my hotel while staying in midtown. I wouldn't recommend it though because it's tiny with very little seating and no restrooms. Being so small, it gets very busy and congested inside, probably due to its proximity to several hotels, businesses and tourist attractions. There are 2 more Starbucks locations within 1 block of here; 1 is right across 6th Ave"

Food tasted ok, but did take more than normal amount of time."

This is my go to Starbucks, they have amazing service and a wonderful staff.  My favorite barista is Elba, she's always got a smile and makes sure the order is correct.  Markel is another favorite of mine, he's always willing to help and makes sure that things are in order. 
My company does a huge sale twice a year and we start the morning off with a 30 person Starbucks order... imagine being the person in line after me, rushing to work-... major side eye vibes. Lol  Elba helped us to organize and pay for the order ahead of time, to save drama and chaos in the morning rush.  We were all extremely satisfied and are extremely grateful.  Thanks Elba, we love you!"
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2017-12-25,2,"It's actually not a bad location as far as Starbucks goes - but just beware that they do NOT allow use of the bathroom. Would have been great to post a sign so well-meaning, pee-laden folks don't just buy a drink to no avail...."

There are about ten rotating artisanal varieties of beans from which to choose. I tried the Nicaragua Maracuttura and was quite pleased with the strength and nuanced flavor palate. Of course, this coffee is not on par with the offerings of, e.g., Cafe Grumpy, but if one is in an area in which the choices are few, one could do a lot worse than Starbucks Clover brew. 
N.B.: It takes quite a long time to prepare  coffee with this machine (and the learning curve since it's new to Starbucks), so ordering in advance via the app is recommended."

116,starbucks-new-york-548,2017-09-05,3,"Let me start off by saying that I really like this starbucks: the staff is always pleasant and my drinks are always good. 
However, I can't in good conscience give this establishment a good review. Why, you might ask? Background: I used to work at Starbucks, and at my store we were always encouraged to support each other and create a safe learning environment. This is the company promise to employees and this not what I saw today.
I recognized the employee from my last visit. He was very friendly and happy to help me at the register. However, because today was the first day of the fall drinks, he was getting very flustered and confused. It was only when I told him where the buttons were (because I remembered from my time with the company) that he was able to ring me up. He kept trying to ask other employees for help, but they were more concerned with the line than with assisting him (which I understand to a point, but wouldn't teaching him be more beneficial in the long run?)
He moved to the bar to make my drink, which was good, but he had no idea how to do the recipe. I talked him through it step-by-step. I was happy to do it, but it broke my heart when he smiled and said ""I wish you were the one training me"". He seemed so eager to learn! 
So I can only give a starbucks that I enjoy going to 3 stars because of this. I hope that this can be a learning moment for everyone. Especially in today's society, we could all use a little more patience and kindness."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2017-05-14,1,Worst starbucks in history of new york. Asian male taking order needs to open his eyes n ears. Charged me for wrong order wrong sizes. When asked to correct his response is I'm sorry next time I'll fix it. This is second time he messed up. Maybe next time I go I'll bring q-tips for him so he can hear.

116,starbucks-new-york-548,2016-04-22,2,"It is very slow  today...and dirty. Perhaps new baristas are being trained, but there is chaos, slow lines and incorrect orders. Both Trash cans are overflowing and obviously haven't been changed for awhile.  The floors have debris all over.

My order was wrong, as well,  and I waited far too long for him to get it right...he just wanted me to take my chicken/artichoke sandwich and vente black iced  tea and go!  It was not black iced tea, although he insisted it was. Another customer pointed out to him that he chose the wrong container, at which point he finally changed it and gave me the right one, with a scowl.

I've been here so many times before and have generally received good service. So, I'm willing to chalk it up to a bad day and give them two stars instead of one, but management better check out what's going on and fix it before customers get angry and cross the street to the other Starbucks."

116,starbucks-new-york-548,2016-03-21,1,"This Starbucks is close to my job location so I frequent this location every day. Everyone is courteous besides one employee, Elba. She's unbelievably rude and obnoxious. I have witnessed her behavior with other customers on other instances and was disgusted. She's condescending while customers are ordering their drinks as if customers are not entitled to say their drink order. I even felt like I was going back and forth with her to ensure my drink order was what I wanted. This location do yourselves a favor and get rid of Elba. No one wants to go to Starbucks early in the morning and be matched with someone's nasty attitude."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2015-12-25,2,Want to use restroom but they told me its out of order but their was no sign of it. I think they don't want me to use it.

116,starbucks-new-york-548,2015-11-11,1,Never have I seen so many people behind a counter and so little work done. Line or no line they couldn't care less. If I'm going to get ripped off for coffee I'll just go to a small shop instead

116,starbucks-new-york-548,2015-10-05,5,"What can I say it's Starbucks, which means long lines and good drinks. I went here twice since my company moved locations and I haven't had a problem. 

Once I ordered a vanilla iced latte and the second time just a basic pike. Both times my orders were correct and tasted well. Both times there was a long line but it's impossible to find a Starbucks with a short line on NYC especially in the AM or during lunch. 

The batista spelled my name right on my cup and served with a smile. That's something that's hard to find, someone who actually cares about their job or customers. 

I will continue to visit this establishment and recommend this Starbucks."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2015-08-01,1,"I can not understand how a business that serves food/beverages has not a public restroom... That is unthinkable in a developed country (illegal in most of them). The barista just pointed a public restroom across the street when I asked... In midtown Manhattan... 
The typical Starbucks for the rest. But that's a deal breaker."

116,starbucks-new-york-548,2014-11-10,5,"Probably one of the most efficient Starbucks.  It is organized, clean, and drinks are made in a timely manner.  Very well staffed for the amount of traffic this Starbucks gets.  Seating is limited."

Can I pee?  10-person line. 

Can I buy coffee?  Maybe... if the barista feels like it.

This is the closest S_tarbucks to MoMa, so I guess it serves me right for leaving the museum after closing.  Oh, and this place is located close enough to 5th Ave to draw tourists on weekends.  The Halal Guys were right across the street, so people were getting their post-meal confectionary crave on at the creambucks.

Why y'all standing around the starbucks eating your tzatziki amalgamation?  This is a coffee establishment.  No outside food aka gettaaata ma face. Ugh."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2014-07-13,1,"Literally the worst Starbucks I've been to so far. I wanted a simple strawberry lemonade venti size. The whole time I was ordering the cashier was extremely unfriendly and repeatedly asked me what I was getting. She asked ""blended strawberry?"" which I replied ""no.""

The employee there was extremely nice: I ordered a venti half lime and half hibiscus iced tea and water. I think the person who made my drink was only supposed to be the cashier because he called for someone else, but he made my drink incredibly fast. He was also really pleasant."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2013-07-16,1,Worst Starbucks I have been to ever. Huge lineup at till and pickup. Only one barista and one cashier while four other staff are cleaning and stocking the store right in the middle of the morning rush. Talk about misplaced priorities.

Starbucks wouldn't let me re-use my plastic cup because it wasn't a Starbucks cup or mug.

I will be boycotting your store because of this.  Phooey!"
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2013-03-22,3,"Its a Starbucks, a chain focused on supplying magical caffeine conveniently every four blocks. This one is average sized, maybe a smidge bigger, but the layout is a bit awkward. There's a definite bottle neck at the end of the ordering line and the crowd waiting for their cuppa joe. The seating here, however, is bright and airy and not too cramped, as long as you're not the one sitting on the side with the crowd of waiting coffee addicts. This Starbucks is a good candidate for sitting: blind dates, killing an hour, or trying to cram more work in before that off site meeting. Since its pretty new, everything feels a tiny bit nicer. 

The baristas seem nice, the lines move quickly, they get my drink right. All is well."

It's Starbucks."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2012-11-20,5,"This one is across the street from the Hilton. Better than the one inside the Hilton. It has more employees and you get your fix faster.

These guys are fast and friendly. 

The place is big. 

Being in a New York Starbucks is much different from visiting one in Fort Worth. 

It's not the staff that is different. It's the people.  In NewYork they mind their own business and are just detached. 

By the way... visited this one 3 days in a row and no Toilet Paper in the restroom. 
Is this a New York thing?

What do the ladies do when they go in there. 

The Starbucks in the Hilton is really bad. 
Slow employees and they don't act like Starbucks employees. 
After my first visit I made the trip around the block to the real Starbucks. 

Later."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2012-06-27,2,"Typical Starbucks fare, so the food is consistent. The service is a bit lacking. I came here everyday for about a week. So out of 6 orders, they got 2 wrong."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2012-05-20,1,"I was in NYC on a business trip last week, and dropped by here for my morning fix.  I typically hit up a Starbucks when traveling because they are predictable.  Kinda like the McDonald's of coffee.

Not so much.  I ordered my standard (triple nonfat latte).  They screwed it up.  I ordered a bagel.  They forgot it.  They had fans running because it was humid, and the place just smelled bad.  To top it off, while waiting for my latte I was squirted with some unidentified flying schmutz whose origin and producer is still unknown.  It hit the side of the espresso maker and the barista behind the bar could have cared less.  I get it - it's Manhattan and no one has the time for anything, but the busiest Starbucks in Seattle (my hometown, and I get that my perception may be skewed) at least seems to have people who care about their customers and sending them on their merry way happy.  Not so much here. Strangely, when I was there, I found a ton of negative reviews for this location, but I threw caution to the wind because I wanted my darn latte.  Probably a few other places close by that would do the trick. Only one review is up for this site, and it's relatively positive, so I thought it was prudent I share my experience.  it's New York - why not try somewhere else?"
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2011-10-12,2,"Same stuff as any other Starbucks (PS the pumpkin cream cheese muffin is back!!).

But straight to the point, this Starbucks was more disappointing than others I have been to.  The customer service here is a bit shifty.  People behind the counter gave some weird glances towards people.  I didn't even know the guy behind the register got me my muffin because he just left it sitting on the counter... I almost forgot I bought it until I was on my way out after getting my coffee.  Don't they usually hand it to you?  Shrugs, the vibe I got from this Starbucks during my mid-day break just wasn't one that I was used to from others (nice, sometimes charming)."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2011-04-04,3,It is a Starbucks.  It served its purpose in serving slightly better than average coffee at a higher price than they deserve.

This Starbucks has the dubious pleasure of being right near a famous food cart that won't be named. We even spied their signature yellow bags in the trash as we attempted to, uh, dispose of our own outside food items there[1].

[1] The wastebaskets were full so we tossed our trash - yellow bags and all - in a streetcan instead."

116,starbucks-new-york-548,2011-03-13,4,"I don't need to review Starbucks for you, because you know what they're like. The good thing about this one is they are pretty quick and efficient with orders (faster than 2 others within 1 block) and they have a bunch of seating options that you can normally snag without a hassle.

In the summer you can grab some Joe and sit on the steps outside too. Great to soak up some rays and people watch the business type on 6th ave."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2011-02-19,2,"Starbucks are what they are... places for overpriced but reliable coffee that should be served hot and quickly. Pastries and food should be avoided. Restrooms and tables should be clean and the music pleasant but not overpowering. 

This Starbucks smelled like soup. And was a bit dirty. And slow. So not a great experience. Nice location though (by the halal cart) - I'll give it that..."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2010-07-11,1,"I HATE this Starbucks. It's not like I like Starbucks all that much to begin with, but I had forgotten how much I hate this Starbucks. 

Having to work on Saturdays is bad enough; working in midtown on Saturdays is even worse. All the usual places are closed. The Pret on 55th is closed (I like their coffee). Macchiato is closed (I like their coffee even more, and the sandwiches). Global Kitchen, Bread Market, ditto ditto. 

So I'm stuck getting coffee from this Starbucks. I realize why I otherwise never get anything from this Starbucks. How I hate this Starbucks. It is overrun with tourists, many of whom are going to MoMA, or probably coming from standing in line outside the Abercrombie store. Or from gawking at the Hollister store. Anyway, no offense to tourists, who bring in much needed revenue blah blah blah, but how hard is it to order? It's Starbucks. Goddamn same thing at every other Starbucks everywhere else. Yes, even in Italy. Italian tourists: you've got no excuse.

Do I sound grumpy? Yes. I'm at work. In midtown. On a Saturday. Even more pissed after wasting 15 minutes at this Starbucks. 

The staff here are fine, but also kind of annoyed dealing with waves of dumbasses all day. You know, even if you're in a hurry, you're probably better off walking up to 57th to the other Starbucks (same side of the street, yes, 4 blocks north). It's less awful than this one. Maybe modern art just makes people really, really stupid?"
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2010-05-01,4,"Perfect spot to wait for the 53rd and 6th Halal Cart guys to show up. 

The bf and I scoped them out from the window at Starbucks. After trying to entertain ourselves for an hour, we looked out the window and saw a line starting to form at the corner 15 minutes before the Halal guys were scheduled to start! We got the heck outta Starbucks and got in line before it got any longer. 

Otherwise, your typical Starbucks' location."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2009-06-30,4,"This was a nicely laid out store. There were quite a few tables and chairs, although they were all the small wooden ones. I miss the large comfy couches and leather chairs. That being said, the cashier was very knowledgeable and handled the requests smoothly. The drinks came out really quickly, and mine was very yummy.

I highly recommend this Starbucks as it is nice, clean, and efficient."
116,starbucks-new-york-548,2009-01-20,5,"Walking into this place after waiting in the 53rd and 6th halal cart for an hour and a half, in the snow, was like arriving at the promised land. Starbucks never fails to deliver the same warm and toasty goodness materialized in a cup of grande latte. As we cleaned the snow off our clothes and shoes in the very clean bathroom, and sat inside scarfing down our chicken and rice while poking fun at all the idiots still in line at the truck, never had I felt more content and it was then that I understood the meaning of true happiness. 

Thank you, Starbucks!"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2019-10-07,3,"My first trip to Starbucks in the US, the nation where the chain all began - I was quite surprised in a negative sense firstly about price, but the merchandise (especially for cold beverages), Starbucks card selection (the design on the card) and selection (they always seem to have more and better drinks than the European stores) were all better.

This store is located on Fifth Avenue, a short walk away from Times Square and Grand Central - it doesn't have any seating inside the main store but Starbucks customers can use the atrium, which is a rather unusual Starbucks experience.

The store is pretty small but still has a good number of staff, I must say I'm surprised with the reviews calling them unfriendly they all seemed rather nice and helpful - but one of the servers did look at me like I'd just killed his own family when I called him ""mate"" (Well I am British after all!)

I went for the US exclusive, pumpkin cream cold-brew which I was very much looking forward to ahead of my visit - my drink took a while to come but they did have an insane amount of drinks to a point they had a rack of drinks, mainly mobile orders waiting - I'd never seen so man drinks so the wait was understandable.

My drink quality was okay - it was served in an unusual style cup. It probably isn't something I'd order again however as I found the coffee didn't taste as good, probably down to needing more pumpkin cream/something to add a bit of sweetness.

I was happy to be able to use my Starbucks card here which I'm normally unable to do in foreign locations - but the US and UK are alongside a few other countries including Ireland and Canada which lets holders use their cards for payment only (you can't redeem rewards or benefits other than stars) - far enough.

The preview reviews do tend to be spot on in terms of the music - it's far too loud and unwarranted and I was nearly ready to walk out to head to a store closer to Times Square until a nice barista picked up a conversation and gave me some faith the store wouldn't be a total shit show.

Probably a better branch for grabbing a to-go coffee rather than sitting in, but still not terrible - Would I return to this branch? Probably not (this could have changed if I was in NY longer than 10 days) with barely average drinks, slow service (as they always seem busy even when the store isn't to the point I swear they're making drinks for fun) and high prices.

As I started to reiterate it again, he was making faces showing us that he was annoyed, although he was the one who kept leaving in the middle of giving out my order. Made my family and I really uncomfortable. Some of the drinks were not correct and when I went to ask for it to be corrected, I got a lecture on why I was wrong. In addition, the syrups weren't even stirred within the hot drinks we got, it sat on the bottom.

Won't be taking my family here any more."

The wait staff was rude--I got a nasty look and an admonition to wait at the end of the bar for my food, and ten minutes later when it still hadn't arrived I was told to get it from the case so they could heat it up. Ordering ahead was slower than ordering in store. 

Poor experience from my end."

It's completely unacceptable to have this kind of service specially for a $8 plus coffee."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2017-08-12,2,Baristas are pretty nonchalant. It's kind of awkward for a Starbucks ... but I guess. Not the friendliest Starbucks staff I've ever dealt with but luckily I'm just visiting and there's 2 others on every block.
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2017-06-07,1,"Been here several times and not surprised the reviews for this location generally center on the less-than-friendly, or attentive, staff. Happened enough to finally write a review. There are better locations nearby!"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2017-04-06,1,"Never had rude barista's from starbucks until i went here, specifically ariel and tia"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2017-03-30,3,Ordered a venti cap and but it was hardly 1/3 full. So strong and I like foam but not that much. Lol
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2017-03-26,1,"Horrible and RUDE staff. The first Starbucks I've ever experience unprofessional staff. My fiancé wanted to use the restroom prior to making a purchase but they said NO, that he needed to make a purchase first. What kind of establishment does not allow you to use the restroom prior to purchasing a drink? The staff needs better education or training with customer service"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2017-03-14,3,"Definitely not the best Starbucks I've ever been to.... not even close. The employees were rude and the place was a mess. Oh well, at least I got a coffee."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2016-12-15,1,"Worst customer service 
The lady who took our order was so rude 
This lady was so bad"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2016-11-03,1,"The manager is so rude she gives people a nasty attitude and the employee as well, she put pressure on them I won't step a foot me and my friends there till the manger is replaced.."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2016-07-23,1,Told me to wait on line for a cup of ice water when I've been waiting on line for 10 mins to get a drink. Reason I don't go into random Starbucks. I guess ill stick to the one near my neighborhood
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2016-02-17,1,15 min for a latte when they aren't busy because they forget? Then proceed to make drinks for other customers first
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2016-01-29,5,"Nice service here today. Definite improvement over several months ago. Staff was attentive toward customers, really working hard to get orders to customers as quickly & nicely as possible. My bacon, Gouda, egg breakfast sandwich is great. Ice coffee, unsweetened is fine. This SBUX is on 47th street, just steps east of Fifth Ave. Nice atrium you can sit in too; I'm able to have a seat inside SBUX today, but I've happily sat in atrium & enjoyed my SBUX while I people watched."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-12-21,1,"I thought I'd been to the worst Starbucks in New York City.  I was wrong.  This is by far the worst.  Considering the location, and the huge indoor adjacent space,  you would think this place would shine but that is not the case.  Here are the problems:

- Rude Baristas, inattentive, eye rolling, nasty, yakking and gabbing about the customers.
- Sometimes the pricing seems random.  I have been overcharged on numerous occasions.
- The wait time for drinks is ridiculous and more often than not the drinks are made wrong adding to the wait time.

I won't go here anymore.  End of story."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-12-03,1,"Not that it makes any difference to them, obviously, but I have officially boycotted this Starbucks. While I didn't think it was possible, service somehow has only gotten worse."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-10-17,1,"The staff is extremely rude! They make you feel as if you're bothering them by being there. The guy that made the coffee for us rudely placed our order on the counter without calling our names or even saying which one was which. When we asked him which one was the latte, he mumbled something we couldn't even understand and walked away. The sitting area is dirty and smelly, which goes to show that the rude staff doesn't take the time to clean up either. Terrible customer service! Worst Starbucks I've ever been too!!!!"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-10-16,1,We look for an Starbucks in a cold night and finally found this place. I would give 0 star to this store. The most rude staff ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-09-06,1,"I get a tea from Starbucks every single weekday morning, and an afternoon drink every single day as well. This is by far the worst store I have been to in the midtown area. I sometimes unfortunately have to stop in here when I'm late for work since my office is close. 

Every single person working here has an attitude and are so dreadfully miserable. I'm extremely explicit when I'm ordering a drink that I want modified (i.e. No water, light ice, etc) and make sure that the person taking my order notes it. But 90% of the time have to ask for it to be re-made because the barista making them doesn't read the notes on the cup. Without fail, they roll their eyes and mumble under their breath annoyed. 

Most customers who frequent Starbucks do so because the drinks can be modified to be made the way the customer wants. If an employee is pissed off about something like that, they might want to get used to it -- or switch over to Dunkin Donuts."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-07-28,5,"I work in the building and have come to this location everyday for over 18th months and have never had a bad experience. The line is always long but the staff gets people in and out of there so quickly. The staff is kind, efficient, and even remembers my daily order! Huge shoutout to manager Danielle for always making sure things run smoothly - she is AMAZING."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-07-25,1,"Worst customer service ever. one of the employees is very rude to us. Just FYI, there are many other starbuckes stores around."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-06-02,5,"Fast, quick, and New York friendly. Came here every morning during my trip and they have always take a care if all my orders and have been efficient. Not sure hay it has low ratings :/"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-05-24,1,"I've never been to a Starbucks where I've had such a negative experience before. You figure with their address, being on 5th ave, they would give extra attention to their patronage. I'm a gold star member, and Delano and his staff denied my my refill. That's one of the benefits of having a rewards card, is to get the perks. But when I asked, I was questioned twice, once by the clerk and once by the supervisor... was I at their store. Truth is, my wife and I were hanging in the booth right next to the counter. I will continue to use atarbucks, just NEVER at that location. They really have to be careful of whom they hire to represent the brand. That crew just doesn't cut it."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-03-26,2,"Three stars for going heavy on the mocha syrup, but lost a star for mixing up my food order. I can only imagine what the person who for my food is thinking now.."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-02-17,3,"When it is snowing, blistery and freezing cold, a tiny ultra busy Starbucks is a necessary stop first thing in the morning. Happily, there are many places to sit in the building lobby after waiting in line for quite a while."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2015-01-15,3,"Starbucks, ubiquitous purveyor of caffeine, located conveniently every four blocks so you never have to look too far. This particular Starbucks is small, maybe 1000 sf, for grab and go coffee only. Enter on 47th St, next to Guess.

Store layout is tight, and you are bound to bump into someone during morning rush. The line to order snakes around through the store and moves pretty fast. You'll pass some baskets of snacks and past the cold case to pick up yogurt, juice, and food. The pastry case is next, then two registers. The line to pick up non-drip coffee backs up by the door and windows. The door opens outward into the sidewalk, where you will promptly bash into someone walking-while-texting. Oh, New York. 

I frequent this location because it is conveniently in my path as I walk to work, not because its the best ever. I haven't had problems with getting my drink order correct or waiting very long, unlike the majority of reviews here. My coffee tastes the way it would at any other Starbucks, so quality is good and consistent. That said, the pace here is a bit frantic, as the baristas barely have enough space to do their thing and all their customers are in grumpy pre-caffeinated hazes crammed like whiny sardines into the store. The drinks come out in a reasonable logical order. Sit tight, its coming. Its only coffee. 

This location is right next to a public indoor atrium in the L'Oreal building. So while the Starbucks itself does not offer tables or a bathroom, you can still sit in the sun soaked atrium. I would still not recommend long work sessions using the free wi-fi here though, as the chairs are rather uncomfortable and there is no guarantee that the free atrium tables will be near outlets. 

Random side note, this is where many of the L'Oreal ladies get their morning jolt - I love looking at their outfits/shoes, which are usually impeccable and fashion forward. (But please don't take this as a reason to be creepy.)"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2014-12-10,1,"Go to the Au Bon Pain down the street on the corner of 47th and Madison, as the coffee is better, cheaper, and since it's self serve it's always much faster. Furthermore, the employees at Au Bon Pain are much nicer, and never act annoyed at the mere presence of you showing up to their store. As an example., this morning, a Starbucks Team Member snapped at me rudely when I asked if someone could refill the complimentary milk canisters, as they were all empty. ""They're being refilled now, sir"" was the exact quote. And sure enough, 4 minutes later milk canisters appeared, but not before 8 other people also needed milk for their coffee. the Like I said, you're much better off going to the Au Bon Pain half a block east on 47th Street!"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2014-11-20,1,"I've been to sooo many starbucks and they always add skim milk into my VENTI ICE COFFEE when I tell them as I placed the order. This one was sooo lazy they told me to add it myself. This is my boss's drink so I didn't know what was skim milk. I asked the lady is non-fat milk the same as skim milk. They didn't say yes or no. said ""it's right there"".. no help at all. The workers are not nice here. If you don't like working there then quit. I know it was a dumb question but I obviously asked because I wasn't sure SINCE YOU DIDN'T ADD IT FOR ME TO BEGIN WITH!! 

This is 5th ave. A lot of tourist are here wouldn't you think they would be nice for customer service?"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2014-09-09,1,"Had a not-so-great experience here yesterday. Ordered a hot americano that was promptly forgotten (even though the barista at the register wrote on the cup and placed it by the machine). Once I saw that I a bunch of orders made after mine had been completed, I asked the barista if there was an americano coming up. She said no and asked someone else to make it. Five minutes later I was handed a cup of hot water. I asked for an americano again since that is what I paid for. The barista pretended to push buttons on the espresso machine and then filled my cup with drip coffee (in plain sight). I will not be returning."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2014-07-27,1,"I would give this place a lower rating if I could. It's unfortunate that people tend to see a Starbucks sign and will immediately trust it. This place is ridiculous.

Other people have mentioned the wait time so I won't touch on it. Instead I'll mention their shitty service.

I was there earlier today with my father. Let me preface this by saying that my father and I have been to many many Starbucks stores in many different states. My dad ordered an oatmeal with whole milk. Immediately there guy starts giving us attitude. He says that they aren't allowed to put the milk in the oatmeal. Fine whatever, maybe there's some weird milk safety regulation in the city. We get the whole milk on the side. My dad asks for a small coffee. He starts filling a pike before my dad can add in that he wants the dark roast. He visibly rolls his eyes and fills a new cup. 

Before we pay we ask how much the milk is that we got on the side for the oatmeal. $3. We could have gotten a latte or cappuccino or most any of their drinks for that price. We drop the oatmeal from the bill.

After paying we look at the receipt cause the barista was clearly not competent. They charged an extra 25 cents for my bagel. relative to the price in he window. I'm not someone to fight over a quarter but I wanted to see whether it was on purpose or if the guy clicked the wrong thing. I ask him and he immediately gets defensive. ""Oh it's the tax,"" I reply saying that tax is not placed individually on every item on a receipt: it is shown in the end. Plus the entire tax for a bill was less than a dollar (we got several food/drinks). There was no way a bagel ℅ tributed 25 cents to the tax.

Next he says ""it's the cream cheese."" Note, he hadn't even taken the time to look at the receipt I was showing him, where a separate charge was clearly written for the cream cheese. 

It is not that he drops a wonderful indicator of his general intelligence: ""sir you are fighting over 5 cents.""

Throughout the encounter he was rolling his eyes and was being far more condescending than I've ever seen a cashier be. He calls out someone else, who had at least some basic manner. The new guy believed that the price had been raised in the machine but that they hadn't changed the price in the window yet. I let the matter go, as again, I was not willing to fight over a quarter. Immediately upon picking up my things and leaving the store, I see our rotund, dead-eyed barista start giggling while talking to the other barista on duty. (That guy was hardly pleasant at all. No doubt he thought I was making a fuss over nothing, and he showed his disdain by slamming my coffee cups in my direction.

I've never seen such insolence and idiocy in a Starbucks.

Guys there are millions of Starbucks stores. Go an extra street in any direction and avoid the fools that work here."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2014-07-09,5,"What I love about New York? The guy that took my drink order is Latino. The person that rung me up is Indian. The couple sitting behind me is speaking Japanese, and the hot tall blonde in 5in heels next to me is Russian. Feeling fortunate to have been born and raised in the best city in the world! #diversity - oh, and I have free wifi... I mean...."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2014-03-23,1,Literally the worst starbucks... they literally just don't want to do their jobs. They also make you wait forever for nothing. I choose McD next door over this Starbucks.
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2014-03-04,1,"This starbucks is pretty bad. The service sucks. They have you wait forever... Why? I don't know because they don't even get a lot of traffic. 

The place isn't very clean. There is always some type of mess going around the place.

They always run out of the ingredients for some of their drinks. 

The employees aren't friendly.

The good side is that there is a big public sitting area right beside it. You don't have to sit inside the starbucks and stare at mess."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2013-11-23,1,It took forever to get my coffee. These guys definitely don't want to work at all: they look miserable and can't keep up. They were giving free drinks to people they knew while the rest of us were waiting. Worst Starbucks in NY.
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2013-08-26,4,"This lil diamond was slipped into the spot during the construction of the L'oreal / Guess update.  I would have named it Starbucks express since its not like one of the other Starbucks where u'd sit and work on your dissertation for hours.  

It's designed for grabbing a drink and / or a snack and then continuing on.  In that light this store is perfect!  The only thing it needs is possibly a third register but they use all the tricks in the book to handle the heavy volume!!"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2013-08-08,3,Pretty quick service.  Clean but not many places to sit which was annoying.  No customer use of the bathroom.
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2012-11-07,4,"I like this 'Bucks. Although its a very busy store, they get the job done. There is also plenty of seating room inside. The only drawback is there is no bathroom. But overall, I dig this shop."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2012-09-26,1,"Stopped in for a much needed caffeine kick and the cashier spilled coffee all over a patron in front of me.  Burned his hand, stained his clothes, still charged him.
Enough said.

Indoor atrium is a plus and makes for a great sitting area.. perfect for waiting for an ambulance to tend to your second degree burns."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2011-10-14,3,"Indoor atrium makes this starbucks awesome, other than that there's no public restroom there.

You can have a massive group gathering here if you wanted too."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2011-08-30,1,"This is a very, very bad Starbucks.

Lines take forever, no matter what time it is, because cashiers are busy bickering with each other arguing with customers. Baristas act like you're trying to steal their puppy if you ask them to remake a drink that they made wrong.

I wrote to corporate (thanks for the free drinks, Sbux!) but nothing has changed... everyone who works there is still slow and mean.

I know this because despite how much I hate this location, I keep going back. It's the closest one to my office, okay?"
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2011-05-23,3,very small for a Starbucks but Starbucks is usually small so nothing spectacular
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2011-01-22,1,The worst starbucks ever! Americano came out just like water with few drops of coffee. Taste like water!!!
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2010-10-09,1,"With over 250 outlets citywide, it would really be something to be the worst Starbucks in Manhattan. Something more than just bad coffee, bad attitude, service slower than the construction of the 2nd Ave subway line; something so bad it transcended all the commonplace stations of mediocrity -- the merely inept, the indifferently incompetent -- and entered, more descended to a whole new world of awful. 

Starbucks 47th Ave is this place, a coffee outlet so abysmal that every objectionable adjective is reinvented: rudeness, irritability, impatience and stupidity -- every aspect of their service from walk in to take out a disservice. 

Here it as if a perfect storm has occurred, a once in a lifetime collusion of ignorance, incompetence and indifference, frothed and brewed to 'venti' sized proportions. You the customer will never be right; on permanently wrong footing, expect instead to be served an indignity from the following menu: mockery, slights, being ignored, being misheard or misunderstood; then expect an extra shot of eyes rolled or outright abuse -- if you even receive your order at all.

You could complain, and every second customer does, but that will prompt yet more recrimination, an extra cup of distaste to chase down the initial spilled all over counter serving. 

It seems that this franchise possesses a self-perpetuating culture of conflict, and is at war with the very people they are charged to serve. In a single visit I saw customers asking about forgotten orders chided not to ""speak to us that way""; saw staff with sighs and rolling eyes yelling at people to repeat themselves; even saw a barista stop a customer from complaining with a litany of their own -- ""you don't know what I've been through today!""

New York is a notoriously busy, blunt city, and it will run you down if you stand in it's way, but with 250 Starbucks outlets to choose from, you can literally find a better option just across the way."
117,starbucks-new-york-563,2008-12-14,1,"This is by far one of the dirtiest Starbucks that I've been to. After my friend and I visited Top of the Rock we continued walking down Fifth Ave. and came across this hidden Starbucks. It was cold that evening so we wanted some hot coffee to keep us warm. Once we were in, we automatically said to each other, ""WOW, there's no line, AWESOME!""; but man was I WRONG. 

I placed my order of a HOT mocha and he didnt even bother to asked if I wanted whipped cream or not. Then we waited for our drinks and what did they give me, a freaking Mocha FRAP when it's freaking 30 outside. Is he out of his mind?!?!? But whatevers, I don't normally complain and just take it as is and when I walked over to grab a straw, there's freaking coffee all over the floor with a ""WET FLOOR"" sign. Are they seriously that freaking lazy? There's like no customers and they can't even mop up the spilled coffee?

Service- horrible, slow, can't get the right order.
Cleanness- dirty, watch where you're stepping

***Stay away from this location if you can***"
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2020-06-23,5,CLOSED. It was my favorite coffee shop on the UES. :(
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-16,1,sorry to do this to all of you champion coffee lovers but never go back here. i was walking by tonight after it was all closed up and i noticed two mice running around the shop!!!! disgusting disgusting disgusting. avoid this place at all costs unless you want droppings in your coffee/pastries.
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-16,5,"Nice little set up, friendly staff.  The environment is cool and relaxing, warm for cold days, nice music (not loud).
Will come again for sure!"
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-04,5,"Champion Coffee is the best coffee in the area.
And also maybe a best kept secret.

Working overnight in the area, I'm  happy they stay open until 8 every day.  Although small, it's never crowded and the sole employee is always pleasant and timely with preparing an ordered.  Compared to other decent tasting coffee, like Gregory's, the price is reasonable.  The lattes are consistently good and the variety of lids and stickers that you can put on your coffee cup are pretty fun too.  My coffee stands out at work and doesn't even get thrown out (by Cheryl, my coworker, who is always trying to clean something up)!  I feel kind of cool and ""in the know"" when everyone asks me where I got my coffee from.  Last week, I took home a can of beans for drip coffee and it's been the best I've had to date.  :)"
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-03,5,I had ice teas which were good. My husband had the ice coffee and said it was excellent! Wishes he'd gotten a larger cup!
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2018-08-31,5,"Love it here, great coffee and great staff. Their cold brew lemonade is really great- it's my go to. The barista nicky b is always very sweet. Buy his hit single, ""Take it to Love"" on iTunes!"
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2018-08-10,5,Best nitro cold brew I've had in the UES.  Super friendly employees as well!
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2018-06-29,5,Cute little spot. Very good coffee and pleasant vibes. You almost forget you in ues not in Brooklyn...wish for places like this around here
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2018-06-27,5,"Big fan. Excellent coffee, clean shop, easy-going vibe, good croissants -- which are hard to find -- and outstanding service that's friendly but never annoying. I usually just have a regular coffee and it's reliably fresh and delicious any day, any time. They also make a lovely latte. Champion has become my favorite coffee shop in the neighborhood, and I've tried them all!"
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2018-05-09,3,"My score is based on the fact that the coffee is extremely overpriced and that they won't let you use their restroom 

The shop itself is tiny, clean, and cute in a generic sort of way. I'm a coffee fiend and theirs didn't strike me as worthy of the cost. 

The person behind the counter was fast and courteous with a splash of fake cheer. 

In summary not a bad place but if you need a restroom and think that by buying one of their overpriced items they'll allow it, then this is not recommended."
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2018-04-23,4,"So excited this is finally on the Upper East Side! 
I love the ambiance here - such a cute coffee shop. 
I tried the iced matcha, and it was pretty good but I definitely want to come back to try an iced coffee!"
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2018-04-16,4,Their coffee is superior to many other places I've been. I don't think it's easy to find good cold brew but this place delivered!
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2018-04-08,5,"Not only was the coffee out of this world, but the hospitality and service we received from Nathan has made this location our new go to"
118,champion-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-11,5,"This coffee shop just opened in 2018, and I have to say, their coffee is great! They have a few locations in Brooklyn and apparently roast the beans in Queens! Will definitely be going here regularly"

119,starbucks-new-york-534,2018-09-26,1,"Took 8 minutes to get an unsweetened iced coffee bc the barista waited until she had four iced coffee orders so she could do them in a batch. Then I pointed out that I'd asked for light ice. She just stared at me, grabbed the cup, dumped it, and refilled it, all without speaking the me. Going to Starbucks is starting to resemble a trip to the DMV."
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2018-01-25,2,Out of all the sbux stores locations I've frequent this is the one store that has the worst ventilation. It doesn't matter what time of the year it it's bad year round. Example: there is two entrance into the store the one facing Madison Ave and the other park ave. It's winter right now why they have the Madison Ave door open is beyond me? Every single time that door opens this big gush of cold winds blows through the entire store. Does sbuxs just wanna take our money and kick out there paying customers? I mean I thought the whole point of having chairs so we can sit down and enjoy our cup of coffee? Instead I have to head else where because it's to damn cold in here to hand out. When it's summer it's still to damn cold to hang out here. Because apparently due to the high ceilings from what some of the barista have informed me the store has to be a certain temperature. Their  has to be more effort invested in fixing this problem or else I'll take my money else where.
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2017-08-23,1,"Lazy, take hours to do your drinks after the barista asks you. No communication between the employees about order and again impressively slow"
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2017-06-28,3,"As mentioned below, the service here is lacking. It's very slow and a bit brusque. I would give the service only one star. The indoor seating is two long  communal type tables and some bar seat singles. Some business folk were enjoying breakfast and having what looked like meetings and business talks. 

But there's an outdoor seating promenade that's worth like 35 stars. I love eating and drinking outdoors and I love Starbucks. It's very businessy and that's a great thing."
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2016-12-02,1,"I can't even. Mobile ordered my drink ahead of time thinking I'll SAVE time - I'll whiz in, grab my warm drink, and head straight into the office for a productivity happy day. NOPE. The reality was I waited 20 minutes in a crowd of people, asked the baristas where my order was several times, they mumble something at me, I wait some more. FINALLY one of the baristas take pity on me and makes my order. Yup, I was late to work. After this experience, I'm done with Starbucks. All I can taste in my drink is bitterness and hatred."
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2016-11-25,1,Waited so long for my breakfast sandwich that I almost finished my cup of coffee before the sandwich came out.  Very disappointed with this location and will not come here for food again.
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2016-09-24,1,"Chicagoian - Popular Starbucks city - 4 workers here...manager counting a drawer, one taking orders, one stocking chips, last walking in and out of back...its 1:30 after lunch hours for the area? Shouldn't have to watch 5 other guest orders be placed before my drinks begin the making process from the same cashier. Not picky but shocked for a NYC Manhattan SB. It all starts with upper management."
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2016-08-13,1,"I've had good and bad experience at Starbucks before and the one here was pretty bad. The cashier named Mariam who served us at 9am on Saturday was effin rude. No manners and when we repeated our order to confirm she replied ""Listen, that's what I said"" with the nastiest attitude. In addition, she doesn't know how to spell. Apparently my name is Alex here."
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2016-01-13,2,"Like all franchises there are hit and misses, clearly this one is a miss. I work in the building, hence i frequent this particular location on a regular basis. Yes, its convenient, yes its nice to look at, the service however leaves MUCH to be desired. From the girl whom i believe is the manager down, there is a consistent air of ""Not Giving A Shit"". You can regularly go in to this location, be it in the morning / lunch or afternoon and you will find 2-3 people (manager included) standing around talking, while 1-2 employees try to keep up with the rush of everyone else. They will make no attempt to assist, and when you actually get tired of waiting for your order of Grande Pike and tell them you're waiting for this...""Yeah they will get it soon""! Seriously?

I get it, due to the location they are guaranteed heavy traffic, so the drive to actually pick up their service is minimal, but i mean come on."
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2015-07-17,4,"Nice Starbucks. Clean, efficient, and quiet in the morning! Only tourists on weekends."
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2015-05-07,5,Always busy but the staff keeps up. Staff is always friendly and really seems to like their jobs. Starbucks is Starbucks anywhere.
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2015-04-29,4,"Starbucks, ubiquitous caffeine supplier to the masses. I like this location because of its high airy ceilings, giant windows, natural light, and the staff are on top of their game. It is on the southwest corner of 49th and Park, but you can't really see it from Park. You have to go up the plaza stairs on 49th St and peer in the windows like a creepster. Yay.

This location is popular with wealthy office drones and will vary wildly from having three people in line to having 20, at seemingly random hours of the day. That said, there are usually at least five people on staff between the registers and the espressos to get it all done as efficiently as possible. I've never had a missed or wrong order and the staff are excellent at speaking loudly and enunciating even the hardest to pronounce names. The location recently reopened at the beginning of the year, and I don't know if the staff recognize regulars yet.  

Seating is minimal. There is a large communal table that seats 6-8 and two two-tops. That said, the plaza outside has several benches, so if you can't find a space to chill for a quick chat, you can go outside in good weather. But I would NOT recommend this location for sitting down and doing work for an hour. Due to the glass walls, I don't think there are outlets anyway. 

The store foot print is a bit narrow, so please don't bring an entourage or giant stroller. If you are the lucky team coffee fetcher, balancing a tray or two through this Starbucks would be perilous during peak hours."
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2015-04-12,5,"Open, professional and quick....that's what a coffee shop should be about. Excellent job I'll be back tomorrow"
119,starbucks-new-york-534,2010-11-01,5,"This is one of my favorite Starbucks in the city. It is full of professionals in the morning lining up to get their daily dose of caffeine and because of the high volume traffic this Starbucks' manager get your drinks while you are in line and delegate to the baristas for expedite service. 

The drinks from morning till afternoon or even evening are consistently good. Rush hours are well taken care of and it's one of the most efficient start bucks I've been in. I am very picky about Starbucks and there are definitely a few bad ones in the city... aka the one on 31st and 6ave, or runner up for me would be the one underground in 1251 ave of the Americas next to Duane Reade. So after many comparison across town midtown, this is the best one for me."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2019-11-29,1,"Absolutely the worst Starbucks I have ever visited in my life!! Slowest, worst customer service. Avoid this place like the plague. Rude and obnoxious molasses working there."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2019-10-15,5,"Friendly staff, clean, and overall best Starbucks I've been to so far. Keep up the great work!"
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2019-10-09,3,"Sheltering from the torrential rain - I visited Starbucks at 560 Lexington Avenue. It's pretty easy to find a Starbucks especially in Manhattan which has around 240 locations which is near enough more than any European country other than the UK.

The store is pretty small by our standards, but typical of NYC and it does have a small seating area inside.

Pricing here was pretty high, my drink ended up costing £1.50 more than it would have done back home for my Venti Iced Pumpkin Spice latte - making it one of the more expensive Starbucks locations I've visited - surprising to considering the US is the home of the chain but NY is an expensive city.

The staff here seemed really helpful and friendly - I was greeted as soon as I got to the store, had my order was taken (name misspelt of course) and had my drink in a couple of minutes - the customer service of the guy making the drinks must also be complemented, he was busy you could tell but he still took the chance to talk to every customer as he made their drink to ask if they wanted certain extras or just make small talk - after making my drink hot rather than iced he told me I could have the hot one ""on the house"" while I waited for my main drink.

He made my main drink a few minutes later and he used a marshmallow cream due to them currently making up the regular whip - I was a little upset that it was more watery than cream but it tasted really good and went with my drink superbly to the point I'll most likely amend my future drink orders for the next week or so I remain in the states.

I did find the music in the store to be a little loud however which I did find to be a problem in a few branches around the city.

Good drinks and good service yet with high prices and a large number of small issues (from not having any cream ready to the music and getting my order wrong) but still worthy of three solid stars."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2019-07-13,1,"Coffee is not rocket science but to the folks here at the Starbucks apparently it is.  Simple order large coffee..waited a few minutes saw orders after mine get processed so i asked if they forgot me...which they did, no big deal i went to put cream in the coffee and asked if they had any and apparently i must have irritated the girl about wanting my coffee as she proceeded to bite my head off and tell me they were out?  i highly doubt they were out of cream which it needed for other drinks i was just being punished...disappointing!"
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2019-04-30,5,"So, I had gone to another Starbucks location about 4 blocks away (sorry!) And the frappuccino was made terribly. I could only get through 2 sips before I had to force myself to wait and drink anymore. Fortunately, I had come to this location, instead of complaining directly to the company. And boy, the associate Oren did do a great job with making me feel welcome to the greatest store on Earth. He even gave me a little dance. Thanks Oren, the dancing barista. From one dancing barista to another, you made me afternoon delightful."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2019-03-19,3,"I hate to give Starbucks a not so stellar review, but unfortunately it deserves it. This is a great location as it is right off the 50th street exit of the 6, and it is pretty big. But they are just so so slow. I pass this Starbucks most days going to work, and I typically don't stop in because there's a long line, but the other day when I went, it was pretty empty but still took so long. I understand it is in a very commuter heavy area, so if it was busier I'd understand but they should be able to accommodate the crowd. They also don't seem to be hustling. They were just moving slowly and with not a ton of urgency. The drink I got was good tho and up to Starbucks standards. Just can't stand slow service."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2019-03-01,1,Have been to Starbucks all over the globe and never found a bad one until the one in Port of Authority Bus Terminal in NYC....THE WORST. Cashiers with zero customer service skills take your order and $.....then today after waiting 10+ minutes tell me there are no more of that type of breakfast sandwich and I need to pick another. I chose my $ back and she was not happy. I thanked her for not only no breakfast but for now making me late for work. She could not have cared less. Starbucks should either get someone who can truly manage this location or close it as it represents Starbucks extremely badly......GO UPSTAIRS TO DD!
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2017-11-25,1,Cashier not a gentle guy. He serves you whatever he wants and throws the food. I have been in better Starbucks.
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2017-08-17,1,"This Starbucks is one reason I always prefer the independently-owned, friendly neighborhood coffee shop. This one is a case in point:
We're up just about to give our order. My companion asks for the bathroom code. The counter guy says it's for paying customers. I said we are customers, you're waiting on us right now. He says you're not paying customers yet.
He was so flippant and rude, we just walked out. We just wanted a couple cups of coffee, not attitude. 
That brings me back to the preference for neighborhood shops. I'm sure he was instructed by management to always say restrooms are for customers, and I understand that rule. But to be a dick about it because the money didn't change hands yet, while we were ordering...
This is one reason I hate Starbucks. I know corporate doesn't care about customers, knowing that in many neighborhoods they are all there is."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2017-06-26,3,"this starbucks on lexington ave between 50th and 51st st is located inside the lobby of a major chain hotel and is crowded due to the regular off the street customers and the hotel guest who prefer not to pay for the overpriced room service. plenty of seating inside if you can find it and some outdoor seating that's covered overhead so you don't get wet when it rains. the usually starbucks menu of drinks and eats plus wifi is super fast and free. grab a stool by the window or a table seat in the back or grab and go but anyway you choice you will wait a bit especially during the morning rush. the air cond was kicking full blast this morning so i decided a hot decaffeinated cappy with a lemon slice pound cake with my morning papers which i will enjoy and read slowly cause i have time to burn before i hit work. nothing really stands out at this location , workers are quick with orders and seem to keep the place and organized , it's starbucks and it is what it is. 3.5 stars ."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2017-05-24,3,"Want to love this place because the baristas are nice, but I am officially over Starbucks for drinks. Yesterday, someone took my drink and I had to wait at least 10 minutes for them to make another one. How does that even happen? My name was on it. First, I was waiting because I didn't see a drink with my name there, then had to wait to get one with sf syrup. It's annoying because I ordered it with the mobile app in advance for a reason. The baristas knew exactly what had happened. It was a nice gesture to give me Julie or whoever's drink, plus my drink, but I would rather just have my drink on time. Once I finish the last of the money I have left on the app, I'm done. And I wont be spending it on drinks! My advice: Never order a frappe! I'm not even sure why they make them. They are time consuming to make and so many things can and do go wrong."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2017-05-23,5,"Lifesavers! I left my bag (an anniversary gift from my wife) and they chased me down diligently. Rell(?) figured out how to get a hold of me, called my cell and office multiple times, and could not have been nicer. Great folks."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2017-04-13,1,"If I could get no stars I would this is perhaps the worst customer service consistently I have ever experienced I use it because it is close to work but the staff is either inefficient, hostile or both there are other coffee shops in the area I would really suggest you use those if it all possible"
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2017-01-16,1,"The barista who took my order acted as if I made up a drink I usually get--the salted caramel mocha frappuccino. ""We don't do that. We have a mocha, and mochas are usually hot drinks."" Well, ok, so I guess it hadn't been advertised all holiday season? They still do this drink during the off season, but without the salt topping. I told her it's my usual and she still wouldn't put it in until I finally said I just wanted my croissant only. Then she asked ""what size?"" And I saw on the register screen that it had ""SCM"" for my actually order, with no acknowledgement of being in the wrong. They also messed up on my friend's order and didn't add in the lemonade to his drink.

They're also not very pleasant at all. I should have read the reviews first."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2016-12-27,3,"Funky hours of operation, it closes at 4pm on most days.  

I found the Wifi to be fast and free (PLUS) but they have HUGE lines in the morning.  Also, if it's cold, every time some comes in, or goes out - expect a gust of wind.  BURRRRR. 

Staff was friendly, but not super fast.  Depending on the time of day, this is not a quick cup of coffee."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2016-04-20,3,"Ahaha, I read these reviews and I'm not surprised.
I'm giving it a 3 star rating because my initial order of a grande cappuccino was fine. Things changed when I went to get a refill. Everyone on shift did not know the drink refill policy and said that my original drink had to be a coffee/tea in order to get a refill. One lady said I could not so I went and pulled up their policy and I showed it to the manager. He said that he was trained in a different way and my friend said that it's the Starbucks policy and its the refill that has to be a coffee or a tea. He shrugged and walked off into the back and the cashier lady yelled to the back SO WHAT DO I DO? and he yelled back JUST GIVE IT TO EM. 

Like for the record, I'm not dying for a refill but they should know their policy"
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2016-04-20,1,"Probably one of the worst Starbucks in the city, horribly misinformed on the refill policy. They denied my friend a refill after he purchased a drink, because according to them you had to purchase coffee or tea in order to get a coffee or tea refill, which is not at all how the policy works. It wasn't just that though, because the baristas there just generally had a horrible attitude towards customers. Wouldn't recommend coming here."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2016-03-02,1,"Got a cup of coffee early - worked a bit in the store on the free wifi - wanted a refill so I jumped in line with my cup ---

the little prick behind the counter (the same one who served me earlier) accused me of grabbing the cup from somewhere else to get a discount cup of coffee. Please!! And WTF!!!

I tried to tell him I'd been there for over an hour working -- but he interrupted me -- told me he wasn't going back and forth then rudely tossed the refill to me -- I slapped a buck on the counter and asked his female co-worker if she remembered me and she said ""yeah, you were in here early early."" The prick's response was ""do you want your change?"" 

I can take rudeness, but being called a liar is not on my chart ..."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2016-02-05,3,"Well they got rid of the worst cashier I at a Starbucks that I ever met, and the service at this Starbucks has improved a whole lot, so now I am not left standing waiting for no show coffees and bread loafs. So now I come here a few times a week."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2015-11-24,1,Stores closes at 8pm I got there at 7:40pm asking for a butte croissant and they told me they didn't have any left. So I exit the store and since it's all glass I looked back and they have a box down the counter with at least 50-60 croissants so u went back in and ask if they were sure no croissant was available they told me NO again so I ask them about those on the box under and they told me they were not for sale until the next day... Really?! You have food and you don't sell it until the next day???
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2015-08-04,2,"Randomly stopped at this location for a quick smoothie with my daughter. She loves Strawberry Smoothies and my first thought was SB which was close to her daycare. 

This would be my first time ordering a smoothie for her at SB. Luckily we saw a Strawberry Smoothie option because she doesn't want anything else (picky little lady at 11). We order a grande Strawberry smoothie and a grande Mango/Blackberry Lemonade (they were out by the way). 

After my daughter tastes her drink she says something tastes funny. The first thing she says is it has bananas in it. I ask the barista does it include anything else and sure enough bananas. I told her we wanted the Strawberry smoothie and pointed to the menu. She tells me all of their Strawberry Smoothies have bananas in it and says it's listed on the menu. I'm no rocket scientist but I can read very well. The menu doesn't state smoothie and neither does the label on the cup (see picture).

My reason for writing this is, SB should clearly label the ingredients. My daughter could have been allergic and this could have caused a major problem. On a brighter note, the barista offered an alternative that only had Strawberry but tons of sugar but an alternative nonetheless.

3 for service, 1 star for poor labels so 2 stars for this visit."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2015-01-19,2,"Watch out for the entrance doors! They are very tight and will smack you right in the face. I just had a drink spill over myself due to it. I went back in and explained myself and spoke to the manager about it and they rectified the situation by giving me a fresh drink. They need to fix these as if someone gets hot coffee spilt over them because of this it could be a major problem for them. They said is was the building management's problem, but really It can become their's if they don't get it fixed."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2013-10-31,1,"grossly mismanaged as a corporate store. had to order 7 minutes to order a coffee, while the cashier chatted away.  after she took my order for a tall regular coffee, instead of serving me the coffee, she decided to keep taking other orders.  doesn't seem like this cashier ""samantha"" cares about the brand or the manager.  never going back there."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2013-10-08,1,"Worst Starbucks I've ever set foot in.  Disorganized, slow, clueless staff. 2 errors on 3 items and dismissive of us when we actually expected them corrected.  Brutal."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2013-06-13,3,"Had to take a star off because they recently changed the staff, not sure why, either because of new ownership or for whatever other reason, but this new staff just seems unorganized, and the waiting time has definitely increased."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2013-01-04,3,"This location is impassible during the morning hours. you are guaranteed to stand in a long line any time between 8am (or earlier) and 10am (or later). They also discontinued the free refills that I loves so much. 

However most of the staff here is very friendly, which keeps me coming back (that and it is still in the same building as my office)"
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2012-12-22,3,"Lots of Starbucks in the area and this one is conveniently located right by the 6 train 51st St station.  Expect the usual with the coffee.  It's usually pretty busy in the morning with a long line that winds through the tables making if feel crowded at times.  Have had some attitude but overall the staff has been pleasant on most of my visits which I think is saying something at a busy location.

Note, some pictures are not of this actual Starbucks location (or Starbucks at all)."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2011-05-23,3,"I get off the 6 at 51st Street every morning for work, so I am here at least once a week.

On the plus side, the workers are generally friendly and in a good mood.

On the downside, the line is generally very long.  I actually prefer the longer line because that usually means the service is better.  For example, there are certain days where they rush through the line so everyone's paid and there are a good 10-15 people waiting for drinks.  Those are the super slow days and that is when customers get angry.

It drives me more nuts because they prefer to do coffee over all other beverages here (and most Starbucks), so if you have anything iced (like myself), be prepared to watch about 10 people who were in line behind you get their drink first."
120,starbucks-new-york-566,2010-06-16,4,"This Starbucks is pretty nice. While the coffee is the same as any other, it's very convenient to both work and home, plus the location is outstanding.

On nicer days, the outdoor seating is a great change from most midtown locations and unlike some of the UES 'bucks it's covered so you can hang out on a rainy day."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2020-07-09,1,You must be kidding. Woman behind the counter made my pickup order wearing no mask. One customer with no mask - said nothing. So I tossed my pickup order because some of us are in high risk groups and still taking covid seriously. Out the cash and hungry.
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2020-03-17,4,"Great juice chain, with one of their stronger points being the sheer number of locations in the city. They make solid juices (of which I recommend their AMG or Energizer) but also serve coffee and light bites as well. When it gets busy, the waits can be a bit long but otherwise it's a nice spot for an afternoon pick-me-up."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2020-02-12,1,"i was pleased to hear this place could juice celery for me. i asked for straight celery juice and got cj with added olive oil.umm no, that isn't straight celery juice, please remake.  #2  was off to a good start until the juice guy decided i needed ice in my cj which dilutes the extraction.  my problem with this place is that they dont listen!  i asked 2 times for staight celery juice and they failed not once but twice.  im mad at myself for tossing the juice in the trash and not asking for a refund..no apologies from anyone at joes.  big fail and ill never go back!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2020-01-06,4,"I ordered a small juice and sandwich. The juice was good. The sandwich was, too, but I'm just not a fan of the very thin and toasted bread. Other ingredients tasted very fresh."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2019-12-01,1,"I will never come back here.

This was my first time visiting Joe and the juice and the person making my juice dropped kale on the floor and picked it up without washing his hands or changing gloves.  I told him ""excuse me, you just picked up something from the floor"" and he abruptly changed his gloves & didn't give me eye contact.  I had to say excuse me about four times before he lifted his head to get his attention. I don't know if he was pretending not to hear me. I asked him to please change his gloves and he did I thanked him and he had a pus on his face the entire time. I don't even think any kale went into my $10 juice. He slid the cup towards me, dismissing me, still no eye contact.

This is a serious department of health violation -- touching his shirt, the counter, a rag, the floor  and raw juice ingredients with his gloved hands!  Imagine what happens when you're not looking.

This is a disgrace for the brand. Make your own juice at home."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2019-11-23,4,"Our lunch experience is worthy of at least 4 stars.
We got:
Choco Shake, large.
Prince of Green, small.
Turkey flat bread ""sandwich"" (we shared it). Mom remarked about the delightful crunch and thinness of the bread. I would've liked more turkey, and it did drip of oil.
Healthy option at a reasonable price in NYC for lunch!

After reading other reviews, if one wants to nit-pick: Okay, so the floor appeared to be in process of replacement/partially missing linoleum, the entry rug appeared to have received customers on a windy day (some leaves/debris), and my mom who used the restroom didn't comment about the status (if it was bad, she certainly would've said something). The staff was pleasant enough: nothing outstanding to comment on, busy/brief, but not rude either. Can't comment on their coffee/lattes.

My mom and I enjoyed people-watching from our table with their large windows on Broadway. Many customers were present using laptops/spending time visiting. 

At least 4 stars from our experience. More turkey and less oil is why I'm rounding down from 5 stars."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2019-11-08,4,The baristas are great. Quality of products excellent.    But..... can you please fix the toilet seat and proprerly clean the bathroom? Thank you

When I pointed out that they store is scheduled to be open for 8 more minutes, the unfriendly barista told me that she doesn't know the official store hours and that she had decided that the store is now closed"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2019-06-16,4,"First time trying Joe & The Juice, and I would come back. This location is near a busy area so I would probably try a different location. My visit was very crowded, with a long wait for my drink. I also was looking for a place to hang out, but with the crowd and loud music, I had to leave. The drink itself (I got the Pick Me Up) was SO GOOD. Exactly what I needed and at a good size."

He yelled at my friend for using the staff restroom that had no ""staff only"" sign on it. This was great because it prompted my friend to build a time machine so she can un-piss her piss from the imaginary staff toilet. If you like mediocre 5$ luke warm ice coffee, you have to come here!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2019-05-05,3,For whatever reason the service peeps were angry at this location...the avo shake was good. Specially with the spinach... but maybe a pep talk with the staff?

I know theyre a juice place but they might as well get rid of the coffee options. I got a latte and i could tell the espresso was burnt. The Service was fine and its cute inside but ill try a juice here next time and update the review"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-11-17,2,"The coffee and juice are fine, but the employees are the most inconsiderate and obnoxious employees I've ever met.

After having to try multiple times to get their attention, they continued their conversation with each other as I ordered. After I finally got my order and sat down, they continued to scream, yell, and bang on containers as people were trying to work and read. Many other patrons visibly were bothered by this noise.

I did not expect the shop to be as quiet as a library, but when it is as loud as a party, it is unacceptable."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-10-30,3,"Joe & The Juice... I'm a big fan of your brand, I like almost everything but can you improve your staff service? I thought it was bad in Europe only but most of the guys and girls who work in this brand are arrogant and hard to find them smiling! Don't ruin the brand with such staff quality."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-10-01,1,Terrible experience. No cards only cash. What is this Brooklyn/Chinatown? The girl working the counter was nice but I waited over 10 minutes for a whatever juice served in a little silly cup. Not worth my money or time.

Will never be back, what a crap experience.  They lure you in with a good looking trendy feeling interior and healthy looking menu.  Nope."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-09-11,2,"What's going on with this Joe and the Juice location?! Management better clean up this mess, employees are not friendly and certainly not professional. I've been to so many Joe and the Juice locations and it's always been a really great experience. This one here has potential but it would take a serious re-train of the staff. 2 stars because I believe in the franchise but this location certainly felt more like a 1 star location. :/"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-09-06,5,"I love Joe & The Juice! This location is nice and it has a trendy vibe like most other locations. It's usually pretty busy because of the location so you may have to wait a few minutes get your order.  

I love the Greenshield in the herbal tonic juices. I also love their ""sandwiches"": they are these little light tasty Panini's. 

Enjoy!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-09-06,2,"I paid $22 and waited 16 min for a poor panini and terrible shake

Nice place, but only two staff members, how can they tend to a line of customers with only 2 people?!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-09-05,3,Thanks for the response. I gave it another shot this week and noticed that there were additional people working and It was much smoother!
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-09-02,1,"Just left here and felt compelled to write a review because of how inexplicably awful the service was here. I walked in and the guy behind the counter didn't even stand up or acknowledge me, but proceeded to yawn and look down. I greeted him, he looked up, and I asked if they had soy milk and he just flat out said ""no"". So I said ok, do you have any other milk alternatives? To which he muttered under his breath that they have almond. I said, ""no worries, I'll just take an iced coffee please"". To which he lazily makes me an iced latte with whole milk. When I clarified I was asking for an iced coffee, he sighed, rolled his eyes, and said ""oh"". And then said they have no ice, so he couldn't give me what I had already paid for. Skip this place and go somewhere else!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-08-14,1,"Three strikes and you're out. I've visited this location three times now and each visit has gotten worse. The common complaint in all of these reviews is that they are SLOOOWWW. Waiting 15 minutes for a drink is unacceptable. Their smoothies aren't smoothies, it's a warm liquid I could have made myself rather than waste $10. And not to mention, everything tastes bland and disgusting! Never again. If I can't get a refund on my time I at least would like one on my $."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-07-27,3,Great spot in NYC. The service was great. We were gladly given samples of their product. Either my order was messed up or their juice is the same thing as their smoothie. I wasn't blown away by their product... but I would give them another try.
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-07-19,1,"Never, ever again will I go to this location. For the fourth time in a row  they're painfully slow, not aware of who's paid and who's standing on line to place an order and out of stock ingredients like certain juices or milks! I ordered a smoothie that lists banana as an ingredient. I didn't expect it to be 1/4 of a banana! I asked for a refund. Never again."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-07-13,2,"1. WiFi not working (I'm a freelancer, so 50% of the reason I walk in to a place like this is to sit and work on my computer).
2. In the bathroom, the seat of the toilet was not connected to the bowl, so when I sat down I went flying--not quite IN to the bowl, thankfully. Had to squat to pee. When I told them about the problem they were like, ""oh, yeah, sorry."" ...
3. My $8.50 apple-passionfruit-ginger juice tastes like straight apple."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-06-17,1,"The juice was good, but the management is horrible. There were no seats or tables available, and it was quite slow. We noticed a person sleeping at one of the tables taking up three chairs and two ottomans. When we pointed it out to the sales associate, and asked, where's the manager, he said,""he is the manager"". That's a first!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-06-17,3,"I got the coco shake. Was expecting a smoothie and the consistency was that of a juice. I was also surprised how small the 12 oz size is- looking at the cup I could swear it looks like it's 8 oz. Other than that, the taste was good. But would never come back given small size and i like thicker consistency.

This is an update:
I just tried the same drink, coco shake (which is suppose to be a smoothie) at another location in Wall Street. Same exact juice-like consistency. I am officially convinced that this is not a place to get smoothies, might be a good juice place, but I never drink juice. The word smoothie should simply come off their menu."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-06-14,3,"Awesome ambiance! Sandwiches are pretty good & tasty :) Coffee/lattes are extremely overpriced (not worth it). Juices are good. I would say the service is fast but the customer service isn't amazing. Overall, it's A - OK."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-05-31,1,"I live right by this location and service has never been stellar but really off late has deteriorated badly. Slow service, just sloppy. I've started going to LaColombe as at least they are organized and can get you out in a timely manner. Here one is waiting forever and there seems to be no urgency. Yes I get this place wants to be the cool Starbucks but people do work and getting an iced latte should not take 12 mins. It's not like the milk is being frothed. It's ice milk and shot. Also does the music need to be thumping at 913am w heavy rap music? Loosing what little charm this place had."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-05-22,2,Their stuff is good but the wait is looong especially at lunch. The poor kids working behind the counter are working so hard but they are chronically understaffed and there's always a crowd of increasingly unhappy customers waiting for their drinks and food. Maybe it's better other less busy times but I just spent my whole lunch standing and waiting for my food. Sad!
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-05-18,2,"This was my first Joe & the Juice experience outside of CA. I went around 1pm and had to wait 15 minutes for my juice. I know they were busy, but that seemed excessive. There is plenty of seating, but the WiFi doesn't work. They do have clean bathrooms but no hook for your purse/backpack."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-04-11,5,"Isabella was super friendly, fast, and helpful!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-04-01,1,The staff at this location is completely oblivious. Be sure you train your people better please.
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-03-28,1,"Yikes. I waited longer for this luke warm ginger latte than I've ever waited for a coffee in my life. I actually thought they forgot my order. One of the juicers actually yelled ""if you're waiting for a drink, sit down! We'll call your name!"" But there wasn't nearly enough seating for everybody waiting. 
If you're going to take that long, of course customers are going to try to see what's wrong. I typically enjoy Joe&TheJuice but this location is terrible!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-03-22,1,"So slooooow. I've come here a few times and the guys behind the counter all seem like sloths who just woke up, taking one step a minute. Hurry up people, it's New York!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-03-06,5,What can I say about this company that hasn't been said already. I love it! I love any coffee shop that will play good music and has dope clean decor. This one is definitely calm compared to the Soho location so its good for focusing on your work but if you want that fun lounge vibe I recommend the one in Soho (I believe prince street. Its big!). Well forever have only good things to say about this chain!
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-02-16,4,I've been to Joe & the Juice three times this trip to New York city. Consistently good coffee and really fantastic fit outs.  Great place to catch up on emails and get a good coffee.  Trees they do Flat White. Great customer service and hip music.
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-02-03,2,"I like the coffee very much but it is extremely noisy with a bad music , i have felt that I am at a disco, I couldn't stay more than 5 minutes ."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-01-22,5,"Not the most places to sit but high ceilings, clean space, cute tables and candles make this place a nice place to catch up with friends or do some work over a really good espresso drink or refreshing juice! Tried their latte (no syrups btw) and my friend had their prince of green juice. Latte was really satisfying and the juice was so refreshing!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2018-01-14,5,"my go-to hangover recovery spot. the music is loud enough to drown out my anxieties (but i understand that may not be everyones preference). yes sometimes it can take forever, but i've been a semi-regular here and a friendly attitude goes a long way because my orders now take 5 min or less. the staff are my favorite! this one guy always says ""i love you"" as i'm picking up my drink. well, guess what! i love you too! this location isn't bad, just misunderstood. also the espresso is tops."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-12-28,3,"Joe & the Juice was nice.  Like some other yelpers have mentioned, juice is juice! A bit overpriced, but then again, what isn't in NYC? 

I came here for lunch one day and unfortunately ended up waiting a half hour! Turns out some woman walked away with my juice! The employees were so helpful though and once we realized, they immediately made me a new drink, and let me keep the woman's who took mine!  Lucky me too, I ended up liking hers more than my own!

I would definitely come back to this location for lunch again when I'm trying to cleanse or keep my diet healthy!  Friendly service and good juice!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-12-22,1,"Ah, there is something about this place...something very special.  Was it the large golden retriever who entered with his owner right past the ""no pets allowed"" sign?  That could be it.  Maybe it was the friends of the staff who entered after us, ordered after us, but got served before us.  Or the charming ""you're keeping me from doing nothing"" attitude of the staff. In any case, the atmosphere of this pace certainly matches the mediocre coffee and cappuccino we payed way too much for.

Drop in and say hi... not that they could hear you over the loud, obnoxious music."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-11-12,3,"Very trendy, but overrated. That is just my opinion though. The quality of the juice is clearly fresh. I went around midday and there was no line. It took about 10 minutes to get my order. It was a simple small ""Hell of a Nerve"" juice. It contained strawberry elderflower banana drink that wasn't too sweet. It contained some pulp which kind of threw me off but was to be expected. The drink in total cost $7.50. I would go back but won't rule it out for people to try."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-11-05,3,"The juice and Food is good and even the atmosphere is cool, but the employees love to crank up the music so loud that I can rarely hear myself think, so it's usually the last place I want to sit and enjoy my juice or Food. However that may Be what they're going for. Personally Im tired of every cafe and juice bar feeling like a night club"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-11-04,1,"Rude staff, wifi doesn't work ever. This is right under my building but I'd rather walk 3 blocks than go here."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-11-03,2,"Update 11/3/17 - music still, as always, wY too loud. Cannot have a conversation.  Bad location for any sort of professional meeting. Unfortunate, because it's right on n the middle of the midtown business district. 

Update 9/28/17 - music still way too loud!

Their coffee is delicious. The staff is friendly and attentive.   I would give the place a perfect score, however, there are a few issues. 
1) Noise.  The music is way too loud, all the time. I remarked about it one time, and one of the staff members told me ""the owners are European, and that's just the style they're going for.""  Well, I have been to in Europe and many times, and I can tell you that 99% of the coffee stand with men's do not have disco music blasting.  The location would be a nice place to stop and work for 30 minutes and take in a bite, however, The noise level is just unbearable. Please turn it down and, I would recommend a different genre. Something more low-key
2) no more 2% milk?!?!  Please bring back the 2% milk"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-10-19,5,"I CANNOT believe that I have been asking for a skim latte for more than 3 weeks and today I realized THEY DON'T HAVE SKIM MILK! It should be illegal to get served something you DID NOT ask for. ANY pf the staff could've warn me instead of taking my order and then using a milk I SPECIFICALLY asked not to. So now you know - no skim lattes - no skim milk AT ALL even if they take your order.

UPDATE: They now have fat free milk AND the contacted me to send me a gift card. Amazing customer service and great spot!!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-10-08,2,"Clean cute place. Super overpriced for what you get. Ordered turkey sandwich: Fresh ingredients, but mostly bread. Nothing but bread"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-09-11,2,"This place is awful. While the staff is friendly, it takes 20 minutes to get a juice, and when you finally do it's 25% foam. Don't waste your money."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-09-01,2,"Joe & The Juice is all over the city and my experience with them has been poor (in both locations). First the coffee, it's decent, it's a average, it's what one might expect. That much gets you 3 stars in NYC. (3 stars is good, 4 great, 5 excellent) What made this a 2 star establishment for me wasn't the coffee so much as the service I received during what I'd call non-peak hours... The guys working behind the counter were cool, sort of joking around and making the most of their time working there. They got my order wrong not once but twice. I was not in a hurry but that doesn't mean you should work super slow either! 

Besides the slow and inaccurate service, the coffee is alright. If you're looking for a Starbucks substitute I guess you'd come here for the wifi - other than that I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. 

This might just be my luck though - I'm sure others have had good experiences here."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-08-30,5,"FRESH,CREATIVE,HEALTHY! Lots of options on the menu with a fresh variety of fruit juices used! 
Open a store in Nj please!!!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-08-22,3,"Love their products, but store isn't well run.  It's always unclear who has ordered already and who is waiting for orders, and staff does nothing to detect people causing  bottleneck at register. It's also frustrating how they try to batch orders together (even if the other order is two or three behind you) causing longer wait times. Please make your staff and procedures as good as your products!"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-07-30,1,This location is a hot mess. I always forget how slow it is and make the mistake of going back. It will take a good 10 to 15 minutes to get a sandwich even if no one is in there. They are very disorganized and slow and I agree with the others that the music tends to be too loud. I don't know how they survive on weekdays in Midtown.
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-07-30,4,Large selection of juice and smoothies. Came here one morning before work. I got the Joe's Root juice which was really good. If I came back I'd probably get the larger size.
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-07-26,2,I've been here twice and both times the service was deplorable. The storefront location is lovely but the music is so loud you can't even order. Although there is a ton of fruit sitting around it always concerns me when there are swarms of gnats everywhere.  There are so many juice  joints opening up I would find another and pass this one by.
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-07-22,5,My daughters and I went there a couple of mornings during our stay in NYC.  The food/coffee was great and the staff was friendly and attentive. A great/relaxing atmosphere/music- made for a perfect start of a day. If we lived in NYC we most likely would become daily customers. Thank you!
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-07-18,1,"This place is ridiculous. Shakes are water consistency, with minimal flavor. I got the easy shake-- I paid $6 and drank a watery banana with a mint leaf. Then I bought the breakfast club for $10, an acai bowl served in a CUP. No effort put in it. No fruit toppings like in the description (bc theyre blended in), and some plain jane cheap granola. I mean come on, give me my money's worth Joe! You're better off making these 3 ingredient ""shakes"" at home for $3."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-06-19,1,"I had a bunch of plastic in my juice. Ewwww!

I've been to a bunch of joe's juice locations and this one is definitely an exception (an exception in a bad way) - seemed like the staff wasn't really paying attention to what they were doing. $14 for a ginger shot that was super chunky (not blended enough) and plastic in the peas juice drink."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-06-15,2,Cute and tasty but terribly unorganized. There's general confusion when you walk in as to where to line up and staff doesn't give any guidance. I paid $17 for juice & a sandwich. Sandwich took over 25 minutes! I had to ask about it 3 times before someone finally agreed that it had been missed. Then the server made a joke about it. Good place if you have an abundance of money & time!
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-06-10,3,Love their shakes and drinks but SO EXPENSIVE for very small servings. The small coffee shake is $7.15.  It's good but not that good.
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-06-02,2,"I work right down the block from this location, and finally went in the other night ~7pm, wanting a light dinner. Ordered a simple (3 ingredient) $9 smoothie. There were three people working behind the counter, and barely anyone else in the place, but it still took quite literally 14 minutes to get my drink. Glad I didn't go in on my way to work with a wait like that, I can only imagine it in the morning! The music was distractingly loud (could hardly hear my name being called), not an inviting place to relax, though empty chairs and tables were in abundance. Otherwise it was clean and well-designed--it looks really nice. Probably won't bother coming here again anytime soon. Smoothie was fine, nothing special for the price."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-05-18,1,"A coffee shop that has NO decaf? I get it if a restaurant doesn't have it, but a coffee shop not having it is unacceptable! Many people can't have caffeine for health reasons. I love coffee and realized a few years back that it gives me massive anxiety (as it does for several friends of mine). Usually most serious coffee shops offer decaf. If you're looking for ""great coffee"" this is not the place. Their concept is more of a fusion coffee/smoothie/juice offering. I wouldn't call it a legit coffee shop. It's also a tourist trap (soho location)."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-05-04,4,"UPDATE: I know now why the coffee shake was so awesome (and why it's more calories). The ""vanilla milk"" is actually a blend of milk and vanilla ice cream, according to the barista I talked to. Guess it's going to be a once-in-a-while treat instead of an everyday purchase."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-04-25,5,"Loud, very loud music... and it inflames the loungy & relaxed vibe. What a way to start your day with comfortabel lounge chairs, healthy food/ smoothies for a change and free WiFi. Just chillling"
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-04-23,3,This place has already opened. Tried their juice and it was just ok. They press the juice with the fruit skin so the juice tastes a little bit wired.
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-04-13,4,"Past this spot a couple of times and decided to finally walk in. The decor looks really cute and upscale which I really like. It may look small but it is spacious. They have indoor and outdoor seating area and the staff is polite and attentive. 
I ordered the sports juice and it taste good. It cost about $7.40 for a small cup.
I would come back again since it is now spring and I don't want to have anything to heavy for lunch."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-04-02,4,"The music is very loud, and I love that.  The high ceiling and spacious arrangement (the inside probably seats about thirty) makes this spot great for meeting up to chat and hang out w friends.  There's also bar seating if you're coming in to just have a drink and gather your thoughts (or more likely, play on your phone).

Like all of the other Joe and the Juice locations that have oddly sprung up suddenly everywhere, the drinks are good, but small and super expensive.  Honestly, I don't think the menu items are worth the price, but I guess if you need a place to chill for a bit, a $10 small Breakfast club (thin berry, avocado smoothie with granola) is alright."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-04-01,4,"Good vibe, Great fresh delicious juice, yummy simple healthy sandwiches. Nice place to sit and relax for a few. Nice staff and service."
121,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-25,2017-03-28,1,"This place plays music painfully loud, as if it's a nightclub, and it's pretty bad music too. The coffee isn't good enough to compensate for it. Better avoid."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2020-01-02,3,"Passed by for a quick bite to eat and some much needed coffee. I was in a hurry. I noticed that the line was moving quickly and not that long so I decided just stopped here. 

It's a little coffee shop inside Grand Central Station. It has coffee and an assorted selection of pastries. Upon looking at the menu I decided I was going to order some croissants and a cortada. 

I'm from Miami, so I was thinking the cortada would be the same as what we call a cortadito. I was right. However when I got to the front to place my order, the cashier didn't seem to know what I was talking about even though I was ordering something from the menu. She had to ask the guy that brews the coffee and even he seemed a little lost. But then quickly remembered what it was I was ordering. 

Two regular croissants, one chocolate croissant and the cortada. But then I only received the coffee and the two plain croissants.  When I asked about the chocolate croissant the cashier seemed upset because I think she didn't hear me clearly when I placed my order. 

She seemed a bit frustrated when I reminded her about the chocolate croissant. She said that she didn't hear me order it. Nonetheless I didn't make a big deal about it. I just asked her about it and she then charged me for it and over to get my pastry. 

The coffee and the pastries were fairly good but the customer service and knowledge was lacking. 

Hopefully they improve on this soon because this is a busy location and it doesn't look good on the brand if they don't tend to their customers and learn the menu as well."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2019-12-14,2,"This place has fallen off and I've never had a drink remotely like that lemon foam espresso. Keep going back trying to recreate that initial experience, but always let down. Seem to consistently be out of their specials and even cold brew. Always good for a standard cup of iced coffee though."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2019-10-08,5,"I'm writing this review based on a coffee only purchase. I wanted to grab a latte before I caught my train, and I stumbled upon the Northern food hall. I didn't know anything about danish coffee so I started asking questions. I don't live in NYC, so maybe this is common, but the person answering my questions, Queenie, was very knowledgeable. I told her what I usually order at Starbucks and she recommended something comparable. I was very impressed by not only her knowledge, but her friendly way of indulging my curiosity. Her college whose name I didn't catch was also very accommodating. I know it's just a cup of coffee, but that's the point- they didn't put off the feeling of just taking orders to collect a pay check. The coffee itself is very delicious! I typically drink a flat white, if you don't want your lattes too strong, ask them to give you one of the shots by itself, and the other one in the latter."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2019-09-17,1,"Stepped off the train to get my newspaper and morning smoke before getting on the next train to work. Hadn't grabbed coffee, yet, and decided on trying this new place out. 
The clerk looked at me standing by the register, then looked at the other employee as if to hope she'd walk over and take me as a customer so he wouldn't have to. 
Large coffee, light and sweet with half & half, please. 
I took cash out of my pocket. 
""No cash. Only card."" The clerk said. 
I thought he said cash or card, so I just said, ""Cash.""
""No. Only card."" Quite rudely, in fact. 
""Oh."" So I pulled out my card, $3.81 for a large coffee. (More than Starbucks, I might add)
He charged my card, gave me the coffee, and threw the receipt out. 
""Can I have my receipt, please?""
No response. Just pressed a button on the screen and another printed out. He handed it to me and said, ""Cream and sugar are on the other side.""
So, I had to basically prepare my $4 coffee, myself, and as I was, the employee took my receipt and handed me a different one. Not sure if he may have given me the wrong one. 
So, I sweetened my coffee, and added my cream. 
Terrible coffee. I usually enjoy a strong cup of coffee, but it doesn't just taste strong. It tastes burnt. As if it had been sitting for a while. Long enough to burn the bottom of the coffee maker and burn into it and leave that taste for the next customers who would be unfortunate enough to get their coffee from that pot. 
Like I said, it's a new place, figured I'd try it. Now I know, and won't go back. 
Rude employee. Bitter, burned tasting coffee. Too expensive. 
Should've just gotten the $2 coffee from the guy at my station going into Grand Central."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2019-09-12,3,"I tried this place out because GC had a coffee promotion going.  As other reviewers mentioned, the coffee is very acidic, but full of caffeine. I had my morning cup around 10 am and was still up in the middle of the night.  The attention to customer service is definitely lacking. I ordered a  and was given a muffin.  I was rushing to work so didn't realize I'd gotten the wrong pastry until I arrived in the office.  I returned the following morning and spoke directly the manager. She offered me a complementary . Great on her part for making up the mistake.  Is this place pricier than Starbucks, sure.  But it's conveniently next to the exit in a busy NYC transportation hub."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2019-09-01,1,Just had coffee at Brownsville Roasters at Grand central in nyc. $3.00 for a small coffee and it's terrible coffee. What a rip off.. Terrible service too.
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2019-08-22,3,"Only grabbed food here on my way out of town. Glad I didn't get the coffee because the previous reviews steered me away. Had a ham and cheese croissant. Not bad, the food was good, would've like an option to be warmed up, and the service was pretty fast considering. The prices are pretty expensive, but location drives it up. Will save my eating in Grand Cental for Shake Shack downstairs."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2019-04-25,2,Most acidic iced coffee I've ever had in my life. Must assume all the coffee is like this if it's the same roast. No cash accepted.
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2018-12-13,1,"Couldn't agree with the previous reviewer more. 

Coffee so acidic it'll give you a stomach ache. 

Service so awful it'll leave you with a head ache.

Although I will say - what an ingenious scam of people in a rush - bad coffee + incorrect orders while dragging their feet on every order. I wonder how many orders a day they get away with the customer leaving before getting their order (re:other reviewers below).

The only reason this place gets business is it's location - en route to the trains when cafe Grumpy is too far a walk, but save your money and time - it's not worth it. I tried getting coffee here several times before giving up on its watery almond milk and sour coffee. Attempted to see if their espresso with milk was any better today - but after waiting for the barista to chit chat with her friend (mind you, this is during peak rush hour) and then having her ignore the request on my order (which the cashier took) and then proceed to argue with me on giving me not what I ordered - I gave up - I have a train to catch, gave her back my espresso and wasted my $ and went to catch my train. 

NEVER AGAIN. I've been a fool (patron) one too many times."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2018-10-13,1,"DO NOT BUY ANYTHING HERE. Rude cashier, bad service and Americano tasted awful. Had to return it and asked for  a refund. It took them a minute and then she threw money in my hands so coins went all over the floor. And I wasn't arguing with them or anything. They are just pissed off angry people with bad attitude and low quality product here."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2018-07-11,1,"Cool selection but the customer service falls far below normal expectations! If I could take point away I would, shocked at the manner at which the staff behaves and doubt they got any training."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2018-06-15,4,"Im giving this four stars because the barista Peter and the manager Gigi accommodated me after I told him the ice coffee sucked.. 2x! Haha .. if you read my reviews, I am always big on customer service. 

I barely ever come to GCS so in order to stay close by the tracks I go to the first food spot I see instead of venturing and running into a Starbucks I'm sure was close by. Anyway the girl taking my order seemed a lil annoyed I asked to show me what the brioche bun looked like but she showed me and I ordered a breakfast sandwich called ""Harlem"". Scrambled eggs, sausage, mushroom and cheddar on a brioche bun. The bun was good because you can't go that bad with bread and the eggs were good too. However the sandwich was bland and the sausages were like Vienna right out the cab. I took them out. I asked one of the girls for ketchup they didn't have -_-  I said what! Lol ok give me any type of condiment she gave me Siriacha. Ok. Whatever. I ate the sandwhich again sausages out. Upon eating my sandwhich I see there was oatmeals and over night oats I would of much preferred. Face in Palm. 

Now back to the reason this place gets 4 stars... I'm not too much of a morning person .. it's 7am I'm cranky-ish. Not being satisfied with my $7 dollar sandwhich didn't help. But my $3.50 ice coffee I couldn't stand to push through with. I asked Peter what brew is this in hopes of maybe getting a different flavor. He told me he will make me an iced americano .. I gave it a shot no pun intended and it was still a no go. He said that it's ok if I don't like it his manager Gigi was right behind him and he would ask her if I could just grab another beverage out the fridge instead. She turned around and with a smile said absolutely. Took a cold pressed juice instead and walked away  about my New York minute at Brownsville roasters. Fin"

Prepare to shock your taste buds with the vibrant and offensive flavors of hot toilet water that will cost you a small fortune and possibly an unexpected trip to the public restroom. The staff works at an incredible pace, making the queue rival Kingda Ka at Six Flags on a Saturday in July. Plenty of disappointments throughout the day - no reason for it to start with your morning brew."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2018-02-18,4,"Not my favorite coffee but it's definitely convenient as it's right in Grand Central. The staff is super friendly and they keep the line moving quick as they usually don't wait until you get to the front to take your order. There are usually 2 staffers working the line and then you pay at the front. I also think it's reasonably priced especially considering it's location. All around, good experience."
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2018-01-12,4,"Got off the metro and tried this spot out.  Ordered cappuccinos and a honey blossom latte.  Cappuccinos had a little bit too much milk in them--closer to latte composition.  Honey blossom latte was good though!

122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2018-01-10,1,"Unfortunately the service was so slow I almost left the latte to catch my train, and I wish I had! I ordered a skim latte and it was so bitter and the beans tasted burnt, I couldn't drink it. I left the latte at my feet for the duration of the commute. I love coffee and do not recommend this place in Grand Central- do not be fooled by the convenience off 42nd Street!"
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2017-11-18,5,"I wandered over here while waiting for my train; I always need coffee, and I was excited to try something new. I am so glad I did. There were a variety of options, and all of the employees were eager to help (but also respectful of my space and the time it takes to make decisions--a careful balance that's not often done well). I had two pastries, the cardamom bun, and another was the braided stick with sesame. The pastries were outstanding, crisp, chewy, soft, flaky and very tasty. I had a drip coffee too, and found it was robust and flavorful, not bitter, burnt, or watery. 

Every single employee was pleasant, kind, and efficient. They all deserve a raise. I work retail, and none of my co-workers are this good!"
122,brownsville-roasters-new-york,2017-10-11,2,"Great pastry selection and taste with more modern take on, 5 stars.

If you are lucky to have the right person to make your hot drinks with expresso, 5 stars.

Their drip coffee is way too watery, 3 stars.

Most of them to make your expresso drinks deserved only 2 stars.

Iced coffee, watery and sour, 1 star

Personal preference, packaging and overall branding, 4 stars.

Good luck"

123,starbucks-new-york-470,2020-07-13,3,"I literally work on the same strip as Starbucks and I come here pretty often. Mostly everyone that works in this location is super friendly, and extremely helpful. However, there is a newer guy who has been making drinks lately that makes me lower my rating. Not only did he mess up my order twice [both for not paying attention to directions & not realizing it until he'd already made the drinks]. He seemed annoyed (not my fault of course). I get the same drink every time I come [frappuccino] and he made hot lattes both times then reread the sticker to see he messed up. 
This morning I ordered 2 drinks for my colleague and I, and after messing up both of my drinks, he proceeded to assist the five other people that were in Starbucks as well. However, some of them came in after me and he put the drink along with the ice into the blender but never turned it on and got everyone out before me. After me waiting an additional 5 minutes on top of the 10 I had already been there, that's when he said that the blender wasn't working. In the end I got a refund because I was at work and could not wait around 20-25 minutes while the blender was fixed. He also could have communicated that earlier on instead of having me stand there and wait while everyone else was taken care of. The other girl in there was very nice, but as the last time I was in there, he seemed annoyed. I would hate to say it's a race thing because I saw how Smiley he was with a Caucasian man that was in there, but him being in the wrong should have been a little more apologetic rather than annoyed especially when I didn't even say anything or give him an attitude.
EVERYONE else there is sweet as pie!! THEY get 5 stars but he ruined my last couple experiences."
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2020-03-04,1,"Ordered a coffee with heavy cream. She gave me like a teaspoon of heavy cream.  when I asked for more they wanted to charge me extra.  Horrible customer service!  A cup of  coffee probably cost less than five cents, i'm surprised you can't spare 10 or $.15 worth of heavy cream when you pay $3 for a coffee."
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2019-05-12,4,This is my daily SBux.  It is on the larger side.  I find the weekday morning staff to be on the ball- the line- even when long- moves very quickly and the beverages are ready quickly as well.  The store has a good layout for traffic flow as between those getting regular coffee and those getting handcrafted drinks.  Seating is adequate and the store is always clean.  I stopped going to another location 2 blocks closer to my office because that location is a disaster.
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2019-02-02,5,Ordered a strawberry lemonade refresher with raspberry syrup & it was the best drink I ever tasted. Kelvin greeted me with great customer service while taking my order & Justin made my drink to excellent standards. Both were friendly and really welcoming. Thank you Starbucks I will make sure to keep coming back!
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2018-11-15,1,"Oh. My. God. This Starbucks has dramatically declined. The Baristas lack time management and they are so incredibly SLOW.  I'm not sure why Midtown East would hire such inexperienced, slow baristas for a heavy coffee drinking neighborhood (I guess all NYC is).  I stopped coming to this location because of this problem, I actually walk to the one on 53rd & 3rd as that staff is majorly on top of things.  Today, it's snowing horribly, so I decided to choose convenience over experience, next time I will risk a possible slip and fall in the slush to go to the Starbucks that doesn't make me boiling mad.  The staff behind the counter are very unprofessional.  Some just stand there while one person does all the drinks. Today there was roughly a dozen people waiting for their drinks to be made, and about a half dozen in line.  There are four people behind the counter, three moving at a glacier speed.  One girl was slowly putting cups away, how about make a coffee, help your colleague out? It's evident it's not a collaborative team at this location.  This review has been a long time coming, one time - okay it happens, second time - okay, third time - what?, fourth time - yelp review because it's clearly a problem."
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2018-10-10,3,"Not just another Starbucks Coffee shop on a corner in NYC, but a coffee shop that is on a corner of NYC that is another Starbucks in NYC.

Service was good, the cafe had plenty of room to sit and maneuver, and the coffee was just delightful."
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2016-09-02,1,This was literally the longest I have waited for coffee. The employees chatted with customers while people waited in line. Other customers picked up garbage off the counters. It was disgusting. This may have ruined Starbucks for me. Pick a different coffee shop if you don't want to wait for 15 minutes.
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2016-06-30,1,"Took them 10 mins to make me the wrong drink, and they weren't busy. Another 10 mins to figure out how to give me a refund, a waste of 20 mins, not going back there, plenty of other places to get coffee."
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2016-05-20,1,"This used to be my favorite Starbucks location I mean I would go out of my way to go here. However that will all change now that they have moved out the best staff in the world!! Yesterday I ordered my usual drink, with soy milk. They didn't have the favoring for my drink so I had to change my order. Order the new drink and waited - no problem. I waited for a while for my drink - again no biggie - saw the barista using a dairy cup, when I suddenly leaned in to ask the barista about my order and if she was using soy milk as I can't have dairy. She promptly and rudely responded ""Did you order it with soy"" - I was very shocked at her answer as most baristas usually say ""no problem"" or ""sure we'll make it with soy"". She made my drink and I was left with a distasteful experience. Maybe I forgot to reorder my drink with soy - as they were out of my reg drink - but the rudeness I could have done without!!!!! I will not be going back to Starbucks or any other location as all the people lack customer service skills in a big way!!! I will go elsewhere for coffee. 
Bring back the nice people you had at that location please!!!"
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2015-09-19,2,"I am a huge fan of Starbucks but the Starbucks on Lexington disappointed me, when I went there was no AC and the bathroom was closed not because it was broken but just closed. I ordered a Grande Passion Tea lemonade and it was sour and not as good as I am use to."

123,starbucks-new-york-470,2015-02-19,2,"This location is okay and I would have given them 5 stars but I'm really over the barista who always slanders my name on my cup. I've seen him write other customers names clearly but it feels like he intentionally misspells mine. My name is Samantha, so often I use Sam, which he translates to ""Scam"" on my cup and when I do use my full name I receive cups with my name spelled as ""Sementha"". It is so offensive, even more so because my name is clearly spelled as ""Samantha"" universally. What an asshole! Ruins my morning every time... smh"
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2014-11-19,3,"this starbucks is seriously the only starbucks i've ever been to in this entire city where you can bring in your own personal cup for your drink and they will write down your drink order on a brand new, clean and unused disposable cup, make your drink in your personal cup, and THROW AWAY THE UNUSED CUP THEY USED TO WRITE DOWN YOUR DRINK ORDER ON. 
?!?!?!??????????????
i even asked the baristas to please use one of those drink post-its they all have by the registers AND at all the other starbucks i've ever been to EVER instead of wasting a perfectly fine plastic or paper cup but the four people i've explained this to all reacted as if i were speaking in a different language. why...why?!?

other than being the earth's worst enemy and east 55th street's #1 producer of garbage, this starbucks is pretty fast and clean~"
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2014-11-13,1,"I do not like or will recommand Starbucks. Coffee is bad, to crowded and boring... Go somewere else if you want a real cup of coffee. Ok, I am an nerd, but I know a good coffee when I taste one.... The only positive thing is the free wi-fi"

123,starbucks-new-york-470,2014-08-24,5,I like this Starbucks location. They are pretty quick in the morning when all of the New Yorkers are off to work. There are a bunch of seats with desks to study or work. The staff are all nice as well. It is located in a super convenient location being right across from the E and 6.
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2014-07-30,2,Really sloppy at this particular location. They are so obsessed with getting drinks out fast that quality is sacrificed for speed. Quickies are all the same...
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2014-07-29,3,"It was the morning rush when I went into this branch of Starbucks.  It's roughly medium sized for a Manhattan location, shaped much like a long hallway with a counter on the right and an area for the line on the left.  It features the dark wood seen in most Starbucks nowadays.  There is some seating, but not a ton.  This is mostly a location to run in, get your drink and run out.  

The staff was friendly and they made my Chai Latte quickly and efficiently.  Definitely a good place to grab a drink if you're in the area."
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2014-07-11,5,"The happiest, nicest, barristas I have ever encountered. I LOVE this location!! There is a Starbucks INSIDE my office building and I won't go there because of how much better this location is. I went in on a whim one day because it didn't look crowded. I was greeted with a smile. They are polite, quick and efficient. They never forget my food order like the other location. It's a small spot, but even if it looks crowded, the line moves quickly and they get to everyone right away. After only a couple of visits they remembered my face and my order. It's really a lovely way to start the day!"
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2013-12-26,3,"I think a Starbucks would really have to have something special to get more than an A-OK. This one is A-OK with me. Drinks are the same as always, and the staff was neither rude nor pleasant. The line was not long at around 10 am, although I'm guessing it can get busy just before work. The space is large enough to accommodate a line, and there are some seats. I'm not a regular so I can't elaborate. It was a Starbucks!"
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2013-05-08,4,"So... I'm one of those people who orders a Starbucks drink with four adjectives. The employees here have never flinched: no pump of sugar-free mocha too many, no extra shot of espresso forgotten, no skim milk slip-ups. Ever. They're good, and they do it all with a genuine, enthusiastic smile, all day, every day. They even know how to spell my name correctly. (""Errand"" is actually not a name, as far as I know!) The line takes on a bit of an awkward U-shape during the morning rush, but it moves both pleasantly and efficiently enough. I leave here in a good mood, before the caffeine jolt even hits my bloodstream. 

It's not the most spacious Starbucks, and I wouldn't necessarily expect to find available seating for a coffee meeting. The corner location allows for good people-watching at the window seats, especially if ogling suited-up businessmen is your thang. Just sayin'."
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2013-01-30,4,"I rarely say this, but I find the staff to be delightful. Almost always in a good mood, get the drinks right, etc. As good as a Starbucks can get. No five stars here though. Not until they stop charging $.60 extra for Soy."
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2013-01-19,4,"This Starbucks has good service, and (at least when I visit), the lines seem to be relatively short... or the queue moves really quickly. Also note that his location is a bit small, so there's not a great deal of room to park yourself and work or meet with a client or friend-- it's more of an in-and-out Starbucks. This is okay by me though b/c I usually stop at this location when I'm walking from the train to the gym."
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2012-01-12,3,Service has been hit or miss with me at this location.  Seems like they get a little overwhelmed with the orders when it gets too busy.  I go here out of convenience as it's closest to my job but I rather walk a few extra blocks to the Bloomberg building or on 2nd Avenue if I'm not in a rush.
123,starbucks-new-york-470,2011-03-28,2,Service was quick and friendly but the coffee wasn't hot either time I had some.  Tried a little peanut butter cupcake that tasted like a cake mix.

125,starbucks-new-york-139,2019-12-20,2,"Tucked away from the street on the upper/balcony level of Trump Tower, this branch of Starbucks is unlike any other store within New York City as it follows the beautiful gold theme of the Tower its' self, while its seating area is tiny (if you want a coffee which is more than to grab and go within the area you might be best heading into the Starbucks at Uniqlo further down 5th Avenue which is the closest store I can recall with more seating)

Obviously it is a small store but I was so surprised at the lack of seating and the seating they did have was very basic, I can't help but think the store would be better located in the lower level which includes Trump Cafe and Trump Grill as there is a decent amount of seating there, compared to here which is pretty minimal.

It doesn't seem that the store has done much to address complaints by reviewers in terms of cleanliness as there still does appear to be a build-up of empty cups around the tables and anywhere they could be without it being classed as litter. 

2* - Unique store in its' location but still lacks the proper Starbucks magic, yet with typical NYC inflated prices."

There was trash EVERYWHERE. On tables, on the coffee prep area, by the pickup- all over the place. I just wanted to get my drink and go. 
Got the drink. Didn't taste like half and half. Fiancées didn't have cream/milk in it (or sugar). Well, they were out of half and half but didn't tell us/let us know. Cool. Would have been good to know when ordering a breve drink. So he had his iced coffee black and I didn't get my extra calorie boost, eh. We'll live. 
He wanted to sit/rest awhile. There were no available seats so we sat on some stairs to nowhere. This led to us being harassed and basically followed out of the building by a trump tower worker. So don't come here to chill or take a break because there isn't adequate seating to allow for that. Plus there's plenty of Starbucks that you don't have to go through security to get to. Go there instead."

125,starbucks-new-york-139,2016-05-13,4,"Located on the second floor of Trump Tower, this place can get pretty busy during the 3pm slump so plan your coffee run accordingly.

Service - I had a list and forgot to put in a drink order so I went back to wait in line. The cashier saw me get back in line, came over to me, took down the drink I missed, and put it on the house. I can say I'm a happy camper. 

S'mores Frappe - I saw the marshmallow base and the graham cracker crumble, and I knew I found my summer frappe. While it is sweet, it's not the burn-your-throat sweet. 

Green Tea Frappe Unsweetened - Only complaint is that I wish the matcha powder was more thoroughly mixed. 

Emperors Cloud Tea - Make sure not to let it steep too long, or it'll taste mighty bitter. I'd recommend taking out the tea bag after three minutes."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2016-02-26,5,Best Starbucks I feel in NYC. Service is usually fast and eating area is relatively clean. Whenever I order anything whether it be on the menu or custom they have the ingredients. The employees are pleasant and have great attitudes too.
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2016-01-25,1,Poor service. The line is about 15 deep.  They have 2 slow people working. What's up with the Starbucks in trump towers. Why don't they have more people working. Poor management.
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2015-11-23,5,"This Starbucks is located inside of the beautiful Trump Tower which I liked since you can go around anywhere in the building and take a seat. You are not confined to a small Starbucks store with 100 other people.

They definitely need more tables."

125,starbucks-new-york-139,2014-08-29,5,"I like that it's tucked away from street view.  Long wait but at least I can have some quiet time.  Plenty of seating areas strewn about amidst the marble and water fountains.  

SBUX definitely needs some vegan, Paleo or gluten free items.  Their pastries are really passé these days."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2014-05-04,2,"Messy, disorganized, trash everywhere! Overflowing trash cans and napkins on the floor. Service was okay, a bit unfriendly."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2014-04-14,1,"The WORST customer service. Attitude, attitude, attitude. Let's scowl at the customers and be dismissive of requests, because that's the Trump customer experience model."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2014-01-27,2,"Great location, but very long lines and inadequate seating area. They should get more barista-meister's to speed up brewing & getting customers rolling, and more seating."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2013-04-28,4,"Hmmm, all of the reviews that are bad are based during visits to the day time when tourists are looking for a place to sit and relax.

My review is based on a Saturday evening around 8pm when all of the stores are closed and the only thing left open is Starbucks for you to kill time in while you wait for your bus.   

Anyway, I came here around 8pm and yes, most of the seats were taken, but there were plenty of seats in the lower level.   There were two people working and they made my drink fairly quickly.   I had a good experience and I'd return.   They have a huge bathroom that is public and that is a positive.   If you are a tourist and looking to freshen up, the bathroom here and the Starbucks and the seats in the lower level are great."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2013-01-14,3,"This Starbucks is on the second floor (mezzanine) of the Trump Tower so it takes a little longer to get to it than the normal Starbucks.  It is a rather limited setup which does not have the breakfast sandwiches and a very small variety of muffins and pastries.  Be warned!

Other than that, the coffee itself is the usual decent Starbucks quality."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2012-12-30,1,"The location is beautiful....the quality of the service is definitely not. The lines were long, the wait was long, even the quality of the food was mediocre. I wanted to get one of those pre-packaged biscotti to go with my drink, and they were all broken inside their packaging. It's also very hard to find a seat, though I did manage to snag one across from the waterfall fountain. I came here once just to see what it was like and I now have no reason to return."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2012-11-28,3,"It's a slow line, there's minimal seating, and you're punched in the face my Trump's tacky interior decorating skills the whole time you're there. Go here if you're a tourist. Go to 58th & Madison if you're just looking for a regular Starbucks."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2012-08-20,3,"I have to admit I only went to this Starbucks because of it's location inside the Trump Tower. It's really only a kiosk and I usually rather go into a full service store for my S-bucks. Because it is a tourist attraction, it is a busy place and you will have to wait a little longer."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2012-07-20,2,"Feels like it's understaffed plus theres A LOT of tourists that don't know what they want so get ready to wait 10 minutes to get a cup of coffee.  
On the plus side there is a seating area where you can immerse yourself in the uber-cheese ""gold Motif"" of the Donald's tower.
Nice water fountain though."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2012-06-26,1,"Don't waste your time, unless you feel that just being in the Starbucks Trump Tower is worth it. Service here is just short of abominable. Read the other reviews. I'm used to Starbucks being a well oiled machine with trained staff who move things along. The girls here are slow and have a bad attitude to to boot.

I waited in a line of six people *at least* five minutes just to order an iced tea. I should have seen the lack of organization, cut my losses and left right away as one woman did. Then I waited at least--seriously-- another 10 minutes while one employee (out of four) made a bunch of blender drinks!  In the meantime the line to order cleared out so the two employees who took orders (I guess) hung out behind the counter laughing and chatting away. Seriously. Chatting. While people are waiting. After waiting and waiting I finally asked one of the women if I'd ever get my tea. She looked sheepish. I would have too if I was her.

If I owned this Starbucks or was a district manager I'd sneak in under the guise of being a customer to experience the suckitude of service. Then I'd start firing people. 

Or maybe if you're Starbucks in Trump Tower you don't have to care."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2012-01-11,1,Slowest service ever. This place does not portray the vibe Starbucks is looking for. I work in the building and there are many times I have to go to the Sony Starbucks across the street. It can take over 25 min to get a cup of coffee. They need a drip coffee only line to speed up the process. It normally the European tourist that slows this place down but it's not helped by the insanely slow staff. They need to stock the milk bar more frequently as they are often out of milks.  The only time to get served properly is at 8am when it opens if they are ready. The only reason it gets a star is because it has a good product.
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2011-10-18,3,This place has such slow service.  Nothing like the other Starbucks.
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2011-09-30,1,"wow what can i say...nice building
and now the line was so long, and the workers seemed to work with no urgency...which was rude when i gave my order i felt as tho the girl at the cashier had a attitude, i think the manager needs to train her employees to be more nice and work with urgency because there are people in line who have things to do, and what kind of message are you giving to your customers??? seems like you want to lose them"
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2011-08-10,2,"This Starbucks on my last visit wasn't remotely as good as your average NYC Starbucks.  

The line is ridiculous at times, and they don't have enough help, nor are they interested in actually trying to efficiently process the line.  

I ordered something ""difficult"", I guess, because 6 drinks (trust me, I counted) were made for people BEHIND me in line before mine came out.  I don't have 20 minutes for a smoothie on a break at work."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2011-07-04,2,"Dear Mr. Trump,
If you're going to have a business within your business, please have it represent your standards as well. We went in, 3 mildly simple orders. And I kid you not, after about half an hour waiting (well, what would you expect with 3 servers and throngs of tourists. Only 3 servers??), they managed to get every order wildly wrong. 

I sincerely hope you don't conduct real estate in a similar manner. Imagine paying for a 10 bedroom apartment in Manhattan, and getting 2 bedrooms in Wyoming. You've got a lot of things to learn, Mr. Trump, but I see potential.

Sincerely,
tritri"
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2011-06-30,3,"Trumpbucks. It's a a standard Starbucks, but it's located inside the Trump Tower. Thus giving tourists something to brag about, such as, ""I had coffee with The Donald.""  Hey, ladies can dream, right? 

My friends and I came here three times during our stay in New York: once during our initial visit to Trump Tower, the other times while we were out exploring the nearby area.  Why get drinks at any of the other hundreds of Starbucks when you can sip them in the lounge of a building encased in gold."
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2010-04-27,4,As an employee myself  I try really hard not to review Sbux locations as a whole but I'll usually make exceptions for the stores that tips the scales for better or for worse. These kids over at Trump tower really made my day and I did want to throw that out there. The red haired guy at the counter was talking to me about how most people expect this location to be a licensed store (like when a hotel opens a starbucks but they own the store and run it so your miles may vary) but since it's of the regular variety people usually are taken aback when the drinks are made properly. Also this venue has a completely freestanding counter with a detached backroom elsewhere so the baristas were on display for the world to see and one of the few times for me I haven't played the mental game of how many people are doing something improperly at a given moment. Good job guys!
125,starbucks-new-york-139,2010-01-26,3,"This Starbucks is in the shiny Trump Tower. There's lots of seating but only a small counter, which, at 4pm, had a long line. However, the area is kept clean."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2020-07-01,3,"This was my first time at this location and the vibe was less than welcoming. As soon as I walked in to pick up a pre-order, they literally looked at me as if to say ""why are you here"" and then one of the workers let out an obnoxious laugh. It felt so strange from other wonderful experiences I've had at other locations. Needless to say, I'll go to the other locations in the city."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2020-04-30,5,"Considering the circumstances we are dealing with currently. Grab n go still came with great customer service. My order was ready in a timely manner, I was greeted with a warm welcome and I was given a complimentary ginger shot. 
That carrot cake is a must have."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2020-02-16,1,1 star for cashless policy. That's DISCRIMINATION against cash only people. Not everyone has cards. Some people still use cash
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2020-02-13,2,"The juice is good, but the customer service is garbage.  Thursday 13-Feb, the guy working the counter ignored everybody until he finished making a shake.  Basic decency would be to make eye contact and inform waiting customers that he would be with us in a moment.  Nope,  this guy made eye contact with zero acknowledgement and kept rapping along to the music. 
Again, the juice is good but the customer service is garbage. No reason to tip arrogant  unmotivated service"
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2020-01-24,5,Redeemed my first gift card with 10 cups of coffee here and everyone is so pleasant. I absolutely love the type of customer service I consistently receive. Josh by far is your best Barista !! Very knowledgeable and down to earth !! Can't wait to get my next cappuccino!!!
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2019-12-14,4,"Great place to do work! There's Wifi, the staff is incredibly nice, and the place is clean. I got a cappuccino and sat down at one of the tables for almost 5 hours. I added one packet of brown sugar and appreciated the creamy consistency of the coffee as well as the coffee art. 

5 hours later, the place had already closed, but one of the employees saw I was working hard on my laptop so didn't tell me to leave until he was done cleaning up the place. Definitely would come back here to try their smoothies and food. Also the music was great and the conversations were kept at a low volume."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2019-11-30,5,"This is my FAVORITE place to get juice. Although the price is a little outrageous, I really enjoy the freshness of the juice and how nice the workers always are. The is a small location, there are only a few tables and is really more of a grab and go place.

This time, I got the large, ""go away doc."" It is made with carrots, apples, and ginger. It is delicious, fresh, and really good for an oncoming cold. My throat was feeling a bit sore and I really do think it helped a little. 

I also really enjoy their chicken sandwich, tumeric shot, and protein shakes."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2019-08-20,5,"Joe & the Juice rocks! You can get green juice made fresh for you with the ingredients you like. Not made somewhere  else, put in a bottle and trucked in like two other ""green juice"" stores just down the street from Joe's. My favorite combo, kale, spinach, cucumber, lemon, apple. Delicious!"
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2019-08-18,3,"I love Joe & the Juice in general and the baristas are usually nice.  No exception with this location.  But two things about this Joe & the Juice - 1) don't blast club music at 10 am on a Sunday and 2) coffee (especially iced coffee) should be available and brewed in the mornings.  I didn't mind waiting because I had the time but I would have gone to Birch next door if I hadn't.

Beyond that I think the coffee cups are smaller than other competitors that charge the same price, so in that way the coffee is overpriced.  But the juice is excellent and in line (price wise) with others.  

Keep it going - I want you all to succeed!"
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2019-04-29,5,"This is one of my favorite spots! I love joe and the juice and frequent this location as well as the one in soho quite a lot. It's big, and they have the best staff! I consistently get the best service and quality of drinks here and somehow always stay for hours, talking with friends or catching up on work.  

I have never not loved all of their juices (love anything green), and their sandwiches are bomb. It's never too loud in here and it's clean! I definitely always look forward to coming here and enjoying a nice and healthy meal after a workout at SoulCycle nearby. 

Highly suggest the club sandwich and Joe's AMG!"
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2019-04-06,3,The employees were not very nice and service took Forever to get my order. But the sandwich (chicken avo without pesto) was really good. I need to find out where they get their bread from!
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2019-03-14,2,"I usually go to the one on Spring St but I decided to try this location aaaaaand I think I'll stick to going to the one on Spring. My order is always a large power shake. At the Spring location, it's actually a shake. It's thick, has some weight to it, and insanely creamy. (This is starting to sound like a review for that location lol) But this one is super liquidy and not at all like a shake, more like a strawberry-banana flavored water. For $9 I at least expect a shake like consistency. I was close to giving it 3 stars because the taste isn't bad but upon reconsidering, the price of what you get is NOT worth it!"
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-11-16,2,"I saw someone saying they hope their joe is better than the juice, but I'd say the opposite.

A couple of weeks ago I went here to just get a coffee before heading to the park. I asked for a drip coffee, large. They don't carry milk or cream or half-n-half so I decided to take coconut milk with it. I got a small coffee handed to me and told them no, no, I bought a large one. (Two guys, first one to take the order and money and second to make the order and hand it to you) He then was like, oh sorry, my bad, I'll make it a large. I had my daughter with me so at the time he corrected the mistake, I was distracted, but the only thing I DID SEE him do to my too small of a coffee was pouring hot water in to fill up the bigger cup. I thought to myself wtf and that I must've missed some step of that whole process. Proceeded to take my coffee with me, already noting how coconut milk doesn't work well with coffee and regretting my choice. Outside I took a sip and yes - the only thing he'd done to correct HIS mistake of giving me a smaller coffee than I paid for was just adding hot water. I then had a large cup of something that I could only describe as coconut tea. Never, ever, ever, ever will I ever get a coffee from this place.

I'm however giving this an extra star that I'd like to because the guy taking the order was actually really pleasant and yes as everyone said before me, the interior of it is really nice. Maybe for sipping juice though, not coffee."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-10-09,3,"Can't hate on this location too much, especially since it was during the morning rush and there was only one person working. Props to you, juice dude-- poor guy looked like he was playing Overcooked in real life, but by himself. 

Great juice combinations, standard prices for what they're offering, nothing more to complain or praise about."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-09-24,5,My new favorite juice spot in NY. It's a chain and it's delicious. They use all fresh fruits and you can add as many ingredient (+$.90 per item) to your juice as you want! I love how the passion fruit is fresh too!
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-08-23,5,"I got my ginger latte for free because the barista thought I was waiting for too long (when it really wasn't that bad). He was super nice, and the atmosphere of the place is great!"
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-08-15,1,"don't waste your time, energy, or money here. Unless you're craving crappy drinks & service"
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-06-19,5,"I like their coffee. This Cafe has a cushioned bench against the wall that is comfortable and has outlets underneath. The bathroom was clean,  and it is spacious and has updated fittings; recently remodeled for a modern look."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-06-03,3,"This location is small. However, the aesthetic is very nice. I got a Cup of Joe and the coffee was pretty strong. I enjoyed the flavor (might I say it's better than Starbucks). The thing that sucks the most is the price. But considering this is the city we're talking about, I guess it makes sense. What I really appreciated about this place is the fact that it has tables high enough for me to stand at and work at, which is one of the major characteristics I always look to check off when looking for a great coffee shop to get work done at. Unfortunately, another thing I look for - an abundance of outlets - is not applicable here. I could find a single outlet, which meant that I had to move to a different coffee shop after my battery died."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-05-16,4,"I've always been a fan of Joe and the Juice..Most recently they have been multiplying all around Manhattan. I had the avocado sandwich here and it was really good. It took so long to make which was really annoying but it was worth the wait as the sandwich was BOMB. At $10 for a small flatbread like paninni I cant guarantee you will be full but it will be very tasty!

Did not have the avocado shake here but that is my usual at all the other locations, because its just that good."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-03-27,3,"Super SLOW! They take 10 minutes for a cup of ice water. I was standing at the counter and she started cleaning, just serve the customer first, then you can clean. She writes down the order of avocado sandwich as if its hard to remember. Took a while but it was good! They are very stingy on the cheese and avocado its just a schmear. The Scandinavian bread is great and crunchy. Though the food and juices are good they really need to either up the staff or get better people."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-02-26,4,"This is what an avocado shake should taste like.

I've had a few avocado shakes in my life, and I thought I was done with them forever. They were always funny tasting, too sweet, or just plain weird. And then I had the avo shake at Joe's and now my faith in the green superfruit smoothie has been restored. 

The creaminess of the avocado really came through, in an almost pillowy way. The shake itself was unbelievably fluffy and the sweetness level was on point. Looking at the ingredient list, it's hard to believe there are that few things in it, but overall I was extremely satisfied with my choice.

I popped in on a Friday early afternoon and the two people working there seemed a bit swamped. Wait times were a bit a longer than I expected for a juice stop in Midtown."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-02-16,3,"SSSLLOOOOOOOOOOOWW. 
It's all good but you need to have lots and lots of time to hang out for a juice."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2018-01-02,4,"I stumbled into joe's on my way from a transfer to the 6 train. I wanted a quick healthy detox so I swung by for a ""Sex Me Up"" which has ginger, passionfruit, and apple. They have a pretty wide selection of juices, and protein options available as well. Sandwiches and coffee are something that I haven't had a chance to try, so I cannot comment on those. 

I don't know why this place has such a poor rating but I found it to be a nice spot. They have enough heat for sure, (this is actually very important) and I saw some people settled down with their laptops to do work. 

While the gentlemen at the counter are polite and friendly, I feel like this place does not compare to juice generation in terms of price and ingredients. However, if JG wasn't around I'd definitely swing by again."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2017-12-07,2,"I've tried this place twice.  The first week that it opened, I ordered a latte.  The color coded drink menu was very confusing.  It appears as though they fixed that.  I was definitely hoping for more of a selection with the types of coffee drinks.  The juice menu is pretty good.  My daughter enjoyed her smoothie.  Today, I ordered a turkey sandwich and it was just ok.  The bread was not warm at all.  It seemed like after waiting for the press to finish, it would have at least had a bit of warmth to it.  It is close and cute, so I may try it again, but so far I'm disappointed."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2017-11-30,1,"Saw this cute place on the corner and thought I'd give it a try. Got the chickpea sandwich and a drip coffee. Barista proceeded to make me an espresso till I stopped him. Wish I hadn't. Drip was old and warm. Must have been brewed hours ago and nobody bought it. It's clear they are more known for their espresso.. Burnt taste and lukewarm. Figured I'd be better with the sandwich. Wrong again. While it looked beautiful with the charred marks and all, the bread was pregrilled and not hot. Double disappointed. Hopefully the Juice is better than tha Joe."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2017-11-21,1,"I hope the Joe is better than the juice. My 16 oz cost almost $10 (just grapefruit, carrots, and celery) and was totally tasteless. They add ice (without asking) which doesn't help. My first and last visit."
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2017-11-10,4,Excellent service while you wait! And the juices and smoothies are incredible! Advice if your on Lexington Avenue go to this location not the one on 71st completely rude and unwelcoming the minute you walk in!
126,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-31,2017-11-08,2,"Oh for the love of God. I tried to find the Yelp listing to write up the place that went into Mon Petit Cafe's former location (still listed on Via as pickup point as of last night, incidentally) and discover there is a Joe and the Juice on 71st AND LEXINGTON. That's nine blocks north. How many Joe and the Juice locations does the area need? 

This is a juice and coffee joint. People rave about it like it's a cure for erectile dysfunction or a guaranteed female orgasm, if not a cure for cancer. 

It's JUICE, people. 

Props to the interior designer. I mean that. It's gorgeous. The lights at night are magical, seen from the exterior. 

The guys working are pretty funny and cool. They tried to recommend something and I was quite honest about my reasons for popping in: ""I'm just doing recon here, guys. I had to see for myself. I live half a block from here and go to Juice Press.""

You cannot even read the prices (and I have 20/20 vision). ""That ain't an accident,"" I tell them. ""I may look young but I'm almost 46. That's deliberate."" They smile somewhat sheepishly. 

Turns out this chain started (in America, at least) downtown. Now like a virus, it's spread to Bethesda and Melrose (LA). 

Don't get me wrong. It perfectly fine juice and I will bet that the coffee is no better or worse than any decent coffee in the city. 

But there is a JUICE PRESS one block east and a JUICE GENERATION half a block north. Do we really need another slick, high-priced juice outfit in a one block radius? 

I must say those designers did a bang up job. But in spite of the charming young men manning the shop, I will not be patronizing this establishment. It's my small, useless but self-gratifying protest agasint the Starbucksification of Manhattan. 

RIP Mon Petit Cafe."

So much better then the, to commercial giants.
Visiting from the Netherlands."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2020-02-01,4,"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat after visiting Silver Mirror across the street. The fresh baked goods looked so inviting from the window we had to try it out. 

The restaurant is nice and clean. I love the bakery and cafe right at the front of the store. Seeing pastries and bread stacked high is always a welcoming sight to see. 

The staff were all friendly and the service was quick. I was actually surprised that pricing was affordable for this area and not over the top. 

I ordered a lovely breakfast sandwich with avocado and bacon served on a brioche bun and a side salad. It was delicious. It was freshly made and had great flavor. The iced latte with French vanilla was a bit strong but a great cup to get me going for the day. 

I would like to eat here again soon to try the Belgian waffles. Great experience from start to finish. 

* bathroom downstairs just needs some attention*"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2020-01-28,3,"The food is very fresh! Good choice for a quick lunch.Taste wise, it is slightly above average."

127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-12-14,1,"The service here was terribly slow, the staff seemed to drag their feet with only one person really putting effort in. Once seated, we weren't given water until it was requested. Upon finishing our meal, we requested the dessert menu. However, we were never followed up with to place an order from the bakery even after waiting 15 minutes. We had to ask for the check from someone else as our waiter was hardly ever around our table, despite the fairly empty restaurant. We noticed a patron seated behind us ask if there was table service because they hadn't even been greeted after they were seated. They promptly left as they weren't being served, which is something I would have done had I known how poor the service was at this establishment. Overall, healthy and decent food that still leaves you wanting something more, with grueling wait times."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-11-13,1,20 minute wait in line to PAY for food EVERY time I try to get lunch to go at this location. Will not be coming back. And if you don't have an entire lunch hour to waste you're best off going anywhere else.

127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-11-06,5,"I'm from Northern California, and all I can say is how much I wish we had this chain near home. During my trip to NYC I stopped here nearly every morning for breakfast and I am obsessed. My favorite special items are the soft boiled eggs and the bread baskets with the endless flavors of spread. I've tried the avocado toast, which is to die for, a few of the bowls, and a lot of the breakfast combinations. The coffee options are a little limited, but there's always a Starbucks nearby in NYC. My servers were always so nice and helpful and the atmosphere was very family/friendly oriented. It seemed to be a great meeting spot for catching up with friends or family."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-10-31,4,Coffee here is pretty good!! The cold brew is my favorite. I got a chocolate croissant and it was soo much better the second time. Im here in the area very often and if I fancy a Chocolate croissant this will be my first choice! Great location and plenty of seating.
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-10-29,2,I used to love coming here when I lived in NY! I thought I thought I would revisit a place I loved! Woof! The quality has declined. The once beautifully prepared cappuccino was now not a cappuccino at all but a big old bowl of NOT foamy milk with a splash of espresso. Boo. I think they prepared me a latte? But it was still a pretty lame latte. Service was slow even though there were only a few customers. Good point: they now have gluten free bread. Which is nice. Ordered the avocado toast on gluten free bread. Took forever!!! And was guacamole toast! Argh! I wish they would tell you that! So there you go... time to explore new places
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-10-21,4,"This location has very nice service and delicious choices. I love the new plant based""egg"" option. It's pretty and tasty. Will come back when I'm in the neighborhood."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-10-17,1,"The service at this LPQ has always been slow and not great honestly but I would still go once in a while since they do have nice healthy options, overpriced yes, but ok for every so often. After my experience today I will not be returning to this location for certain. The service was truly horrible, I have seen better service at a true fast food chain restaurant. 

The packaging my salad came out in looked questionable and was not closed so I politely went back to the pickup counter where I pointed out what I was concerned about, which was that this had possibly been an order that had been sitting around, or had been an order that had already been returned, and that the dressing had also separated and looked much different than what I have received in the past. As I was explaining my concerns to the worker at the counter he and the girl making coffee behind him just scoffed at me that the salad had just been made and that sometimes the boxes look as mine did in their failed efforts to close the box since the latch is ""difficult."" As I was still talking to them they both turned around and walked away from me. It was so rude.

As I stood there trying to get someone else's attention finally a very kind young lady came over and addressed my concerns. She kindly assured me that the salad had just been made but she would get me a new one if I would like.

I am not one to write reviews, but the manager of this location should be ashamed of the way her/his employees are representing this restaurant."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-10-10,1,"I ordered ahead for a smoked mozzarella tartine this morning and this is what I got... If you're out of basil oil, how about you call and say something instead of sending this out like this? $16.32 for a dry open-faced sandwich. Tried calling them three times now and can't get through. Was on hold the first time and then the call apparently dropped. This whole brand is not what it used to be.  I will be disputing this charge to get my money back. Ridiculous..."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-09-03,5,"I went to Le pain to have my lunch this afternoon with 2 of my friends,we never came over here before so we didn't know what to order and then there was a waitress called Fatna who helped us to give suggestion and she was very patient to take our order since we still had a lot of questions to ask,she was very helpful.Finally we ordered avocado toast which was super delicious and the frittata was the best,too.we really wanted to come back again"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-09-02,5,"Jesse was terrific. He gave good service and extremely pleasant. The food was exactly as expected.

127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-08-26,5,Love there steel oatmeal...actually I've tasted most of there items and it's all good.
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-08-05,5,"Our waiter was great, and they had lots of great options for a light breakfast! Their smoothies are great too."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-07-20,5,"Just had actually such a pleasant brunch here. Jesse was our server and he was SO attentive, I was impressed. I'm deeply obsessed with their vegan blueberry muffin (it's serious) and their lentil and avocado salad felt so fresh. My new neighborhood spot. So relaxing and delicious."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-07-08,3,"So if you're depressed, anti social or hard of hearing this is the place to be! 
To begin the fake host who stands at the front next to the sign that says ""seat yourself"" ...what's the purpose? Next, you navigate the over crowed room to find a table that hasn't been bussed yet ( as most aren't) hopefully it's a less frenetic part of the room where you don't have to read your partners lips. Somewhere between a deliberate clanging of throwing soiled dishes and silverware into a busting station, and screaming children...you find nirvana! A clean , set table with a wrinkled IHOP quality menu.  
OK, points for the pleasant wait staff fresh-and delicious food, but that's about it! 
After that I wouldn't exactly label it a good experience. My partner suggested to me that the noise and frenetic activity is deliberate to make people eat and leave quickly. That's exactly the effect it had on me. Ex
Perfect location if your tinder match is somebody you don't feel ""matched"" well"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-05-21,3,"I frequently come in to Le pain As of late the last 2 times I was greeted with a rather rude counter person  makayla was her name. I asked for 3 mini carrot cakes, I should've checked the bag bc arriving at work I saw she placed chocolate ones in the bag. 2nd day I come in for the same thing & let her know she gave me the wrong thing she gets an attitude and starts to place large carrot muffin in bag after I've repeatedly said that's not what I want! This woman then says this is what you asked for ! I explain I want the mini carrot muffin 3 of them so now she has a nastier attitude along with ringing up my minis at 3.79 a piece when they're 2.49 -2.79 a piece. I ask why the change in price & she replies that's how much it is do you want it or not?! Worst experience ever!!!


So I went in today and the counter service was great I got one of my usuals and due to being extremely tired took it home. My usuals being the carrot minis and if I'm dining in the petit dejuner or bread basket ..... I like how each Le pain has its own character. Also dining in is always a pleasure except for when'd bed is calling lol!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-05-20,5,"I don't typically write reviews but after my experience this morning I felt the need to. The young lady at the counter was so friendly not only to me but also the other customers who were in line no matter how many silly questions were thrown her way. 

Her positive attitude made my iced coffee and parfait that much more enjoyable!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-05-19,1,"Terrible service.  We went in for breakfast, but they were so slow, and whatever we asked for were either served very slowly or not brought out at all.  I think Le Pain deterriorated over the years.  We will never return again."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-05-19,1,"I have been coming to this location since it
opened  and before used to go to the old one a few blocks over . I love the variety they offer and all the healthy gluten-free and vegan option as well . However, the past couple of
months something has happened and the service his been despicable . All the amazing girls that used to work there are gone. Every time I order on seamless they always get the order wrong , every time we come for take out it's always wrong. The manager is rude and yelled at my husband after he was waiting for his order for over half -hour . They always give me regular milk instead of almond milk in my cappuccino and always forget the gluten-free bread for the tartine! get your shit together guys ! I rarely write reviews but this is super disappointing as this was always my go-to place !"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-05-07,3,"I came here with my bestie for a late lunch after hitting the Met on 5th and wasn't as impressed with this location as I was with the one over in Woodbury. The staff was very friendly and our server was super fast and efficient, but the food just wasn't great. I ordered the avocado toast with salmon and wolfed half of it down like the starving woman I was, until I noticed that the other half had really grey, almost white lox on top...huge sign of old, spoiled food. I'm sure not all of it was old because I would've definitely noticed but, I don't think that's good enough-customers shouldn't be sold spoiled food, even if it was ""just half"". I didn't even bother saying anything as I had already eaten half of my toast and we were in a rush to catch the train back home, but  my friend did love her dragon fruit bowl and coffee so I'm sure it was just my bad luck. I probably wouldn't visit this location again but I do love the chain as a whole still and love the French café style this place exudes."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-04-30,4,Service here left a lot to be desired on a Sunday morning. I arrived with 3 others and it took a while to get someone to attend to us. Took forever to get beverages. Like a reallyyyyy long time. Only giving this 4 stars because the food was so tasty but on of our orders wasn't exactly the way it was ordered. I had an order of skillet eggs and everyone around me had avocado toast. One of the avocado toasts was ordered with a soft boiled egg and we legit got a hard boiled egg. We were pretty quiet at that pointso you can tell we enjoyed what we had and were starving by the time we got our food.
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-04-05,5,"Today was clearly a Five Star Experience. The operation was like a fine tuned engine. People on their way to work were swiftly attended to and with a welcoming Greeting. I was among those being attended to by the Manager. He was working along side his employees. I purchased my typical Coconut Macaroon for $1.99 tax included. He gave me a free HUGE Chocolate Coconut Macaroon to try. He said it's new on the menu. They run around $4.00 each! Believe me it's delicious!  I had it for morning snack. 

I'm very familiar with this location. I'm always treated with respect. I enjoy sitting downstairs next to the electric plug using their free WiFi. The Restrooms are downstairs. The Restrooms are always clean. There's lots of seating downstairs and the chairs are super comfortable. 

It's a great place for people to meet each other for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I saw the dining area being handled very professional. Guests are seated very quickly. The employees are welcoming and relaxed. It helps the customer feel relaxed. 

I love all the Le Pain Cafes. I'm particularly fond of this spacious location. Besides it's exactly a Three Mile Walk round trip from my apartment. That's what I walked today. I hope that takes care of the sugar and carbs in the delicious MACAROON!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-04-05,5,"Came in randomly as I was walking by and was pleasantly surprised.  I have been to other locations and thought they were mediocre.  I had the chicken mozzarella tartine and it made me want to slap my mother(joke!).   The service was very good Larry made some suggestions and he was on the money. Food came out fast, he was very attentive..  Overall I would definitely come back and I would def recommend this location to a friend."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-04-03,1,"The service was aweful. I'm siting here half and half an hour has elapsed and my food isn't here yet but everyone else's is (7 people in total). The server kept saying welcome ladies what do you want ladies. I am clearly a man wearing a mans suit. They need training ASAP. My shake was aweful because ingredients were missing. So I asked for apple juice which I had to ask various times to receive. In total my food took over 40 minutes to receive. And the service was aweful, DONT COME HERE!!!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-03-27,4,"Like lots of other reviews mention, this place was pretty busy and loud when we came in on a Wednesday afternoon. What we had was tasty and a decent amount, but there's definitely a lack of love in the dishes that you may expect from smaller joints -- it all seemed kind of slung-together. It was quite expensive and it feels like they want to be up-scale and high-quality, but it's understandably rough to accomplish with a high-volume and relatively large spot like this. All that said, the service was good and friendly, and everything tasted great. Interior is pretty cute, too!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-03-27,1,Bad service I'm waiting 25 minutes for avocado toast and  nobody care!!!! I have a 30 min break and I lose my break I didn't eat because of them I'm not going to back to this place!!!! And super expensive!!!!!
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-03-25,1,"I am a huge fan of Le Pain, but this is unacceptable..."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-03-15,4,"This is my to go every day place,food is delicious and coffee is amazing,my favorite combo is avocado toast and large cappuccino,avocado toast is amazing and you
Can never go wrong with it,my kids love to come here as well and their favorite thing is mint lemonade and Tuscan salad that they unfortunately took out of menu,I hope they'll bring it back,it was delicious."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-03-09,1,"Today, I was in complete shock. My typical Le Pain experience is usually very much enjoyable, however this le pain needs to get it's act together my sister and I waited almost thirty minutes to receive menus and water. The staff was unruly and joking around with one another yelling and screaming and pretty much doing anything but their job. After we recieved our food after asking several times, it took me three to ask for the check because the staff kept forgetting about it and they were disfunctional. I am very disappointed and upset due to the fact I very much enjoy going to Le Pain."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-03-04,3,"Food is good but pricey. Beware of the tip calculation. The check shows suggested tips that are based on the amount including tax, which is just dishonest. I was told by my waiter that it is futile to complain about this because the policy comes from corporate! Tips should always be calculated on the pre-tax amount. Maybe if enough people complain about this in online forums, they will change this."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-02-14,4,This is my go to restaurant when meeting a friend for lunch. I love the vibe at almost all of the locations. It's also nice that it lends itself to being a very comfortable place to eat alone and either read or do your laptop work. The menu choices are healthy and yummy as are the drinks. (Their coffee/tea can definitely be hotter)..remains a fave.
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-02-02,3,"I love the food and the vibes at le pain quotidien, but almost every single time I go to this location it takes the waiters at least 30 minutes (not an exaggeration) to bring us the check after we've finished eating. And they're all so busy we can't even wave them over. It's like they are purposefully avoiding making eye contact with the customers in order to hold them hostage for hours on end. I understand that it's busy and there are a lot of customers, but it's unacceptable to me that they don't have a better system in place to get people their checks so they can move on with their day."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-01-11,4,"I arrived in NYC early for an appointment and needed to kill some time. This restaurant is super busy, but the service is fast!  I sat at the bar area facing the windows, although they have a sizable eating area with full service. Croissant was soft and the coffee was fresh!  I'd like to come back and try some off their brunch items.

I stayed long enough for an early lunch. Chicken quinoa soup is excellent! Check out the pics..."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-01-06,2,"Service was good at first then our server got busy and we had to wait 30 mins for our check. Avocado toast was dry, but the chia yogurt was really good. Had to add sugar to the mocha coffee because it was so bitter. Also the lemonade iced tea was so sour I didn't even drink it. Of all the breakfast places to try in New York I'm disappointed that I went here. 2 stars for the atmosphere though."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2019-01-02,4,"My first time at this place, I got the Belgian waffle which was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I'm not really one for vegan/healthy foods but this place was great. Wasn't feeling the chocolate chip cookie though... I could of made better but overall great food!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-12-08,2,"We never got to eat so this is based off of the lack of service. We waited at the host desk for about 10 mins. After 4 different servers came and used the computer not one said hello or even looked at us. Finally a gentleman said to us he's been waiting over 30 mins for his food. (He'd noticed we'd been waiting) another couple walked out and said to his wife ""I'm not tipping them"" so we left. It looked yummy but unfortunately service was not there. Hopefully they can fix that so others could enjoy what looked like good food."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-11-25,4,"Popped in here for a quick bite and was not disappointed. Their baked goods are out of this world and my daughter loved her lemonade iced tea. Only downside was the service. Thought the lady in front of me was going to have a stroke because it took them nearly 10 minutes to ring up a simple order and took 4 employees to do it. Luckily I was not in a hurry, but she was."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-11-13,1,I paid $3.99 for a stale chocolate croissant. Ate it anyway because I was starving but come on!
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-10-31,1,"Zero stars.  Don't ever go here. Spent an hour here this morning watching my guest eat while the kitchen screwed up my - very simple, but still expensive- order multiple times.  Our server could not be bothered to care... I left hungry and very annoyed.  Free advice for the manager:  if your kitchen cannot turn out sunny side up eggs and toast a slice of bread, fire your cook or get out of the breakfast business.  And don't make me have to ask to remove from my check something I repeatedly sent back without even tasting."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-08-30,3,"I like this location.  It is nice and spacious, but not as spic and span as the lower east side location I like.

The food was good overall-- especially the pastry, but I did get an underdone egg and no appropriate eating implement for it."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-08-05,3,"The Le pain Quotidien here lacks something. Maybe employees.

They don't have enough people to serve everybody.

Takes time to get the menu and they did not manage to refill the water. Some tables are even giving their receipts and payment directly to the guys that are serving."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-05-08,5,"I love Le Pain! I had the vegetable quiche and it was very very good. There was only one waitress for a full really busy restaurant though and I felt very bad for her, she did a really great job though and everything came in a timely manner"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-05-07,1,"Very rude staff. I walked in and was waiting to ask a question about seating. Two of the waiters were standing right in front of me and ignored me for 5 mins and had a conversation amongst themselves. When I said to the waitress excuse me she rudely looked at me and said ""what"" very rudely. I later heard her later complaining and cussing about how she hasn't eaten yet making it everyone's business. She was unbelievably unprofessional."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-04-27,5,"As a traveler in a new city I like exploring and stumbling on excellent places.. this was one of those experiences that resulted in an instant-favorite.  Le Pain had a menu out front and immediately upon seeing the Pad Thai Salad I was a goner.  Then when seated comfortably in the quiet basement area I saw a sign for the Lemon Ginger drink (a combination I already loved and had my own rendition of ""tea"" for) and it was AMAZING.  This meal was fresh, nutritious, and delicious; it gave me life.  Plus I left with a new method of making my favorite tea!  All of this perfection with the cherry on top of great customer service~ I cannot recommend this place enough."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-04-23,1,"The worst service ever! I got a dirty cup, dirty utensils and my waiter was no where to be found. I wasn't even offered a drink and to leave, I had to go to the host and ask for my check. While waiting for he host t ring me up, I over heard her say she can't wait to find another job bc she's dying to quit. That said it all to me."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-04-20,1,"The baked goods and coffee were great. The staff was kind of rude. We waited 30 minutes for 2 sandwiches. When we went to sit at a table to wait we were told that we couldn't sit, the tables were for table service only. I was confused because the cashier taking our order asked if it was to go or if we were staying. I thunk their products are good, but they have kinks to work out."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-04-12,4,"Came here for a casual late lunch. Perfect for the afternoon, decently full but not too crowded. Had good service. We just wanted a quick bite and some soup. It was just right for what we wanted. Wouldn't say the food was to die for but just fine. Like the vibes in the back, lots of light."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-03-31,1,Ordered two matcha lattes and waited about 30-45 minutes for them. Server kept giving us excuses like they have to wait for someone to go downstairs to get the matcha. He gave us free croissants and I assumed it would only be a few minutes until our drinks came but no. We went up to the counter and asked for a refund when about 30 minutes past since we ordered. They then started making our drinks and when they were done asked if we wanted the drinks or the refund. We wanted both but they said their manager was in a meeting so we would have to wait until he was done to get one. Excuses upon excuses for a simple drink order. Do not come to this location if you want fast/normal service.
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-03-28,5,"I give this place a good rating because of the great vibe to the place! Very spacious and vibrant!
The food is also great, nothing to complain about. We had coffee, a fresh bowl of fruits, cream-stuffed donut, and an avocado toast. Yumm."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-03-27,3,"Good place for a lunch meeting, to eat alone, and to pick up some tarts.

Interior: Pretty big place and esp downstairs which I felt like no one really knew about. But downstairs had a more study cafe vibe and was more quiet with the restroom there as well. Upstairs was more appropriate for a meeting. 

Staff: They were fine except in the end, just took a while to get someone to help us with dessert and get the check out.

Food:
Over Roasted Chicken Smoked Mozzarella: Tasted like a pizza so of course I can't say it was bad, but the bread was pretty sub-par for a bakery place.
Carrot Cake Tart, Dark & White Chocolate Mousse, Lemon Tart: This was the highlight! If you come here def get one of these tarts as this was super delicious and honestly where the 3 stars came to make up for the meal.

Overall: Come here for the tarts!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-03-03,1,"Agree with the other bad reviews. Waited 30 minutes today after ordering soup at the front counter. When I couldn't wait any longer was told by the cashier (Kineada/Kinisha?) that staff refused to get the order from downstairs(???). I struggle to understand how this could be possible. Isn't it the job of the staff to retrieve orders??

I demanded a refund at which point she laughed at me. Took the manager Manny 10 minutes to refund me $8.00. Hint: If you can't manage food orders at the counter---just don't take them."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-02-22,1,"What happened to LPQ? My coffee was served in a broken glass that was all glued together (see photo). The walls were filthy with stains all over (see photo). Service was rude and slow, it took a very long time. People sitting around taking space that were sipping on a cup of ice tea and didn't order anything else. I felt bad to see the line of people waiting to be seated that actually wanted to eat. From the spot I was sitting I could see the kitchen. It was dirty, and the employees were not respecting the standards of The NYC health department. I expected more. LPQ used to be great. Also, revisit your policy on having all these people taking space and not ordering. While I was sitting there having lunch, I saw three parties standing in line. Next to me two tables with people drawing, painting and playing on their laptop without ordering anything but one drink."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-02-03,1,"Officially giving up on LPQ. So tempting, so convenient. But so awful x multiple tries. 

Today ordered squash and goat cheese frittata from lackadaisical server (long ago gave up on anything resembling attentive service). 15 minutes later (they weren't busy, but I also know to expect a wait), a ""frittata"" identical to a quiche slice arrived--with a cold center. 

Really? If you're gonna market as a $12 frittata a precooked slice of barely edible quiche, can ya at least zap it long enough to get lukewarm?

Yuck. Done for good."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2018-01-14,1,"I came to this location of Le Pain Quotidien almost weekly and while I had my frustrations, today's visit made me decide to never return.

Usually it takes about 10 minutes to get menus, water, and cutlery to our table.  Another 10 minutes pass and we finally get our order taken.  Another 10-15 minutes to get drinks (usually basic drinks like tea and coffee).  Another 20 minutes for food.  The food is usually good but EXTREMELY overpriced and honestly, probably not worth the 50 minute wait.

Today, I ordered a breakfast bowl without the grain (never ordered it before).  The menu is worded so that the grains seem separate from the brussels sprouts and sweet potato in the bowl.  The staff said nothing as I ordered it without grain.  The bowl arrived and both the vegetables were not there.  The bowl, which cost $12.50, was an egg and avocado over a bowl of lettuce.  It was not until I asked that the staff explained that the vegetables are mixed in with the grain. If I had known, I would not have ordered the bowl.

I was not offered a refund, but I was offered to order something else that I would then I have to pay for on top of the $12.50 avocado and egg.  It was extremely disappointing."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-12-09,4,"This pain quotidien is HUGE especially for the area. They have a whole area downstairs as well that's nice and big with some sofas. Restrooms are big, clean and even has nice classical music playing! You can't get better in  terms of relaxation and space in this area lol

Food is good, a little on the pricey side. 

Come before 11:45am on the weekends for brunch though!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-11-21,1,"Ordered a soup and coffee from seamless, the bag showed up with coffee spilt all over inside and they forgot to add my side condiments for the coffee. (Not the worst thing that could happen) however when you don't drink black coffee you know it's almost undrinkable. The best part was when I called to ask if they could bring it/credit me a coffee the MANAGER said I WAS NOT THERE CUSTOMER I WAS A SEAMLESS CUSTOMER."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-10-23,2,Very slow service. Waited in line forever to pay and have a smoothie blended. Once I got the drink there was a long black hair in it. I told a waitress about it. She said that she couldn't help me and told me that I needed to wait in line again. It wasn't very clean and completely disorganized. The smoothie was okay.
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-10-19,5,thank you so much sharon for all your help this morning! this location was so accommodating and i really appreciate everything they did for me and i know my crazy boss does too! thank you thank you thank you!
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-09-18,1,"When you leave this place you will  be hungry and angry . 
Service is terrible . Most likely you will get your extra order at the moment when you are paying your bill . Of course you will be charged for that because its cheeper than to spend extra 30 min to see manager . 
3 persons are serving 150 quests, tables and all place is mess   and prices are way to much for what they are offering . 
Hopefully they wont stay for long at this location . 
Shame for neighborhood ."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-09-15,4,"I go to school nearby to this location and I like coming here to grab a croissant and sometimes a snack for the day. The croissants are really good, crunch and flakey on the outside but soft and fluffy on the inside. 
Typically, I have had great experiences here with the friendly staff. However, this morning the worker behind the register was rude and seemed really irritated with her other co-workers and another customer. I get it, there's a lot going on, but it is the morning rush, no need to take it off on other customers or have a poor attitude. ‍"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-08-28,1,"Pros- nice and airy light filled space. Good waitstaff.

Cons- whoever's idea it was to serve me my coffee in a bowl needs to have their head examined. I felt like I was drinking lake water from a halved coconut every time I took a sip. Needless to say it was very awkward and embarrasssing, I felt like I was the victim of a practical joke. I eventually spotted everyone else avoiding this by using to-go cups which I immediately requested

Ordered a Croque Monsieur, there was no option for a Madame so I had to order what barely qualified as a softboiled egg on the side. 

Aside from being the worst example of the aforementioned dish I've ever had the only cutting implement they provided was a dull butter knife, so I was reduced to eating the Croque Monsieur with my hands like a SAVAGE.

Just to make a point I also ate the accompanying salad with my hands while glaring angrily.

I have to admit the bread in the Croque Monsieur was decent."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-08-15,5,"I left my wallet here last Friday. I realized I was missing it about 45 minutes later. By the time I called the location, it was already locked in a safe in the office. Dennis, the manager of the location, kept it safe over the long weekend while I was away until I picked it up this morning. 

I really appreciate the attention and service from him and the other staff. Apparently this isn't the first time they've saved someone like me a lot of trouble - apparently a woman dropped a wallet with $500 in cash and got it all back. 

Kudos on doing the right thing - keeps your faith in human beings."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-08-13,3,"My wife and I put together a breakfast picnic and took it to the Park. We shared an avocado toast and it was truly delicious, with a touch of olive oil and crushed pepper. The bread was a nice crispy sourdough that complimented the avocado perfectly. It's cut into 4 pieces, so it's perfect for sharing. We also shared a green veggie smoothie that was made of kale, celery, pineapple, apple juice, mint and it was delicious. 
Netting it out, you really cannot go wrong at a Le Pain Quotidien. The bread is good, the beverages are good."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-07-14,5,"I was in upper East side  and I went to this place  didn't know what to order so this beautiful waitress named fatna helped me to pick my lunch and it was Lebanese salad with shrimp and it was the most delicious meal I ever had , she was so nice to me and very friendly. I appreciate her friendly service. I am definitely going to back."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-07-08,2,"Sadly dissapointed, per the sign I seated myself only to wait almost 20 minutes before I was acknowledged and that too was after I complained!! I ordered the hard boiled egg breakfast with smoked salmon  and they didn't even peel the egg. The breakfast was so bland!!  my server never stoped by to see if everything was ok! I would not be returning the whole attitude needs to be changed! Shitty service shitty food!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-07-04,1,This particular store should be avoided. Service is slow and disorganized in the restaurant and at the counter. If you try this location you are bound to be disappointed. Avoided it
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-07-01,2,"I've been to a few of these over the years, but this particular place seems to be in disarray. I'm not sure what's going on, but management needs to shut the place down and train the staff or something.

Slow service, messy tables, I don't really know what they were doing right, but everything that did happen felt so wrong."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-06-28,5,"I came here for the first time and I was impressed, I really liked the service, the waitress was Colombian and she was very nice, I didn't know they had Those type of mugs with no holder, so it's definitely a very unique concept, they also have a downstairs large area that can be use like a work space and French classes on Tuesdays  which I'm hoping to attend one of this days.
The food was also very tasty, I got the shrimp and avocado toast. Thumbs up for this place ;)"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-06-19,4,"I walked into this shop after mass on Sunday, because of the name - the daily bread.  Cute.

The place had some pastries that wasn't particular impressive looking, but the dining area was open and airy so we walked in.  This place is quite nice for a chain.  We had the Toasted Paris Ham & Guyere Croissant, i.e., ham Croissant sandwich with a side of arugala, the smoked salmon breakfast and two coffees.  I like the simplicity of the food and the organic ingredients.  The soft-boiled eggs had orange-ish yolk and the arugala was a bit bitter.  I love these little notes of flavors though and can see why people who are not used to eating strong raw arugala may not like it, as our neighbors who left their entire Arugala salad behind.   The smoked salmon was not salty and paired well with the plumped capers that tasted like they were picked in the kitchen...fresh!  

All in all, it was a pleasant place for brunch.  The food is healthy and simple, not too saucy.  I like the little  Nutella-ish condiments at the table and the relaxing atmosphere.  I plan on coming back when I need a quick, clean bite that is not boring."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-05-29,4,"It was my first time here. I can't say much about the whole being waited on in their dining area. But I was looking for a quick bite to eat, and this was right across the street. The woman at the cashier was VERY cheery. She had this really positive, down to earth vibe which really set me in a good mood. I ordered an avocado toast with smoked salmon. And she personally delivered it to me where I was sitting which I did not expect since you are supposed to pick it up at the bar. The only thing I have to say is that the toast was too toasted so that it was hard to bite into it. 

This is all based on first-time experience and I can't wait to try everything else."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-05-21,5,"I've seen these restaurants throughout the city but today was the first time I checked one out. Service was very fast and the food was much better than I expected. 
Shout out to the manager Dennis. The tartine and dessert he recommended really hit the spot. Will definitely return."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-05-19,5,"I came in for lunch earlier this week and was a bit concerned when I saw how busy it was. We were fortunate enough to be seated by one of the servers (Susanto). He seemed to have a lot on his plate, however he still managed to make us feel acknowledged. Hats off to the entire staff - I was only able to catch the one name - but was super impressed with how smoothly things ran considering most of the dining area was seated. I will most certainly be coming back again for another LPQ experience. Thank you!!!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-05-09,4,"On a Morning before class I visit here to have breakfast with myself. Made it to here for the reviews and suggestions about the menu. I must say avocado toast is delicious. I won't say the avocado were too fresh, but decent. Portion is just ok. Their coffee, cappuccino, were good, there's a coffee place half block which is better. When I  comes to the price overall I would say is a but a bit overpriced for the food itself."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-04-30,5,Love this place! Always a reasonable wait time. Stroller friendly and healthy treats. The menu is pretty broad so there will always be something delicious to try. I love their seasonal options! the staff is always super friendly. This is our go to brunch spot! :)
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-04-28,5,"I know these chains are all the same but I have never been to any of Le Pain without having a great experience. This location is my fav though because the service is always so warm and welcoming. You never feel rushed or talked down too. Sabrina took care of me and my mother the other day and was so sweet and attentive. The coffee and quiche is amazing, food is always fresh and service with a smile!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-04-10,1,"Awful. There is no structure at the front register. No matter how busy the line, one register is open. There is no menu by the register for customers to order from thus taking up more time while placing an order. Customers skipping each other. Five people mixing beverages (I don't see how this is even possible) and why in Jesus' name does it take the kitchen to 11-15 minutes to put together a roasted turkey avacado sandwich?!?? This place really blew my vibe on a lovey sunny and warm day. Please disperse employees evenly throughout the restaurant to ensure an even flow of customer service and orderly place of business."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-03-25,5,"Great location, lovely staff.  The food was beyond amazing, the avocado toast was delicious. Highly recommend the coffee from here."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-03-22,3,"Im always fond of their ""healthy food"" at this chain french boulangerie. I give 3 star for service. Slow, most of the time you have to flag the waiter/waitress, however, like I said the food is spectacular. Avocado/Turkey Tartine on a Gluten Free bread  is delish. Coffee is so so. Good Hot chocolate."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-03-12,4,"When we walked into the restaurant it was packed and I was afraid we would have to wait a long time for a table for three of us at 2 PM on Saturday. In less than 10 minutes we had a table, and we were served by a very helpful waitress Who brought us menus. She was back in a reasonable amount of time and took our orders.  The food arrived in a timely manner and all three of us were pleased with the food. I had a combination avocado toast, butternut squash soup  and quinoa salad trio. It was beautifully presented and tasted great.  We flagged the waitress for the check when we were finished.  Once we had our cash ready we couldn't spot the waitress, but we were near the pastry station and alerted one of the staff that we were ready to go and they tracked down the waitress to give her our payment."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-03-12,5,"I normally stick to LPQ on the west side, but decided to try this location as I was meeting a friend who lives right by it. 

The food was fantastic! I got the Avocado Toast and it was absolutely delicious. The soy chai latte I got was one of the best ones I've had in my 3 years living in the city. Will absolutely come back here, especially since my server (Blonde hair, said her name was Jenna (?)) was an absolute delight; Very attentive and made sure my friend and I were well and truly taken care of. Thank you!!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-03-09,2,I've never been a fan of Le Pain Quotidien. The first time I tried it was almost 2 years ago and then I just went again this past weekend for my second time. We only went because Alice's Tea Cup had a long wait. The avocado toast was rock hard and the carrot cake was too. The cappuccinos and hot chocolate we ordered were room temperature. I just don't like this place.
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-02-18,4,"I live nearby and come here often for lunch. The food is always on-point and the experience is almost always a good one, but every time it is a major challenge to get the server's attention to give us the bill. I like coming here for lunch, but it's tricky to get out in a timely manner!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-02-04,5,"Huge place coffee/pastry bar of your on the go or you can sit on either of their 2 levels for food and drink.  As you walk in you are greeted by the counter and a couple of seats on both sides of it. Past the counter are tables for you to dine in. The bottom floor has a huge table that can seat 20 people and 3 extra tables around it. This part has more of a library/study type vibe. You can bring your coffee down and do work or read if you'd like. Has separate female and male bathrooms with doors that lock.  Very nice atmosphere, great coffee and food."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-01-27,5,"Perfect for hot soup, sandwiches on fresh baked bread. Quieter downstairs or sit upstairs on long farm tables. Nice servers, no waiting at 1:00 Friday ."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-01-22,4,"This is a huge LPQ with two floors of seating. 

I ordered a couple of things:

Chicken mozzarella bread. Its best described as a unincorporated pizza. Whole wheat sordough, some sauce, chicken, and cheese are all there but not mixed. It was awesome.

I also got a cappuccino and a pumpkin pie. Both were good.

While I really like LPQ and it's foods I still can't quite get over the price. For the amount of money it costs I'd expect just a little more food."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-01-12,1,"Was in the area and came for breakfast on a Saturday morning. It was not packed which I thought would be a good thing. It's a nice place with a to-go counter up front, seating in the back and downstairs.

We sat down and were not acknowledged for maybe 10 minutes, at least. The food was ok. But then our waitress disappeared. We were completely forgotten about - took me at least another 10 minutes to catch somebody's attention for the check when I finally realized she wasn't coming back for us. No one came by for payment either. While I was paying at the front I mentioned this to the guy and he said our waitress had gone on her lunch break. He didn't seem to like it when I told him that someone should have been covering her tables. 

We were not in any rush but this whole experience took up about 2 hours of my life. Kinda makes me wish I had just walked out."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2017-01-02,1,"Pastries up-front are delicious,  very good croissants.    As good as these are, the complete opposite exists for dining room customer service for this location.    I called this out for this location, as finding customer service in their other locations to be excellent.     Requested an item on the  menu  only available at certain hours.    Having done so in two other LPQ locations with the accommodation being met.  This location, the server and dinning room manager refused to bend the rules.   I explained due to digestive issues the item I requested was best for me.   My explanation fell on deaf ears.     I also asked if they cannot serve that dish, perhaps other options could be met.   the manager commented, 'if I do it for you, then I need to do it for everyone'.    explained we live around the corner and are repeat customers, again to no avail.    The place was more than 75% empty too.   Would think a restaurant without patrons would try their best to keep local loyal ones.    We picked up and left as my husband called out, plenty of restaurants in the area, wanting our business no need to stay here.  ."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2016-12-14,3,"The Belgian waffle was absolutely fantastic. However, the service was really slow. I agree with most reviewers when they say it shouldn't take forever to receive pastries and coffee.  I also do not know who was my server because one person brought my menu, another took my order, another took my check and the other brought my utensils. It just seemed very disorganized and there were many confused faces within the shop. Maybe another location would be a better choice."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2016-11-21,5,"I always go there to get the Moroccan mint tea, but this time Dominic the cashier recommended me fresh mint tea, i loved it, it was great, fresh mint muddled, straight with hot water, it was very refreshing, just want to thank you Dominic again for the good recommendation and professional service, this will be my new fav tea! Cheers!"
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2016-11-18,5,"This Le Pain has all the qualities of a great cafe spot: excellent & fresh food, fast & friendly service, a nice ambiance, and most importantly, tasty desserts & coffee. It's a regular go-to for our family, whether for a weekend brunch or a late afternoon lunch. Our recent service from Kristina made for a very pleasant meal. Highly recommend the turkey and cheese croissant, croque monsieur, and turkey chili."

127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2016-10-28,4,Always love this place. Salads and baguette perfect. Pastries amazing. Healthy choices and friendly service. Prices are a bit steep for a chain but it's worth it.

127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2016-10-23,5,Marendi was our waitress and she did a phenomenal job of bringing the whole experience home for us! Food was absolutely phenomenal and the service second to none!
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2016-10-23,5,"I love baked goods and boy, do they have 'em here!  I've eaten lunch here before (soup and salad) though I usually enjoy their Skillet made eggs the most.  Nothing beats their large Latte in a bowl, either - it's delicious and hot and sipping on it whilst I people watch on a Saturday and peruse The New York Times on a Sunday is pure heaven and makes me feel like a grown up. 

The service is what it is - there are many Upper East Siders her on any given day, in a hurry and vying for the best table RIGHT NOW.  What can you do?  I like to watch."
127,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-126,2016-10-16,2,"Twice I bought Pain au chocolat there.  Paid almost $4.00 for one but where is the chocolate in them???  There is a chocolate dot at each end, presumably to indicate that this is a chocolate croissant, but no trace of chocolate inside!  Since this happened to me t twice, I shall never ever again attempt to do business with LPQ."

Although it may give you more gas than SUNOCO
And if you buy too many drinks, it may make you a BROKE HO
But you won't mind because you'll love the milk tea at COCO

Almost as delicious as Ice T's COCO
Even more delicious than Sheldon's Kaley CUOCO
Your waistline will hate you like Lennon's fans hated YOKO
But you won't care once you taste the milk tea at COCO

Better than every single Boba place in SOHO
Makes a lot of Boba stores just vanish like a DODO
More popular in NYC than f**king POKEMON GO
Come and get a milk tea of perfection from COCO

What to get: Bubble Milk Tea Hot or Cold
What else: Katy Perry did a song called Hot n Cold
What else: Katy Perry is hot but her response to my proposition to her was Cold

A very long time ago I was very fortunate to discover the Wonder of Coco. Great Neck was the very first location I ever tried and I fell madly in love with the bubble tea drinks here. 

I actually think this place was so good, that it was one of the reasons I became obsessed with Bubble Tea in the first place. I've probably had 3,500 of the things since then. But not all from this location. Most, but not all.

This is a tiny little location which I like a lot. I come here whenever I'm on the East side of Midtown.

It's wonderfully close to Grand Central Station, and this cute little Coco store gets it done for me, and when I say little I mean really really little. It's just a tiny little room, but they make great milk tea and have nice service too.

It's a cute little hangout and one of the few boba shops around Grand Central that I come to regularly.

If you're near the station and you want Bubble Tea than this is one of your best options."
128,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-23,2019-09-09,5,"Not into milk tea then try out the Lava Perl Latte, they say the tapioca Pearl's are coated with carameized black sugar , well I think is just warm brown sugar and the Marketing  people just wanted to distance  themselves  from Tiger Sugar while still trying to jump into the brown sugar craze.

But this boba thing does taste good whatever they put in it."
128,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-23,2019-08-14,4,"I love milk tea and I've been to many places and so far I'm comparing pretty much every tea/milk tea places. Now I know every place is different but the drink base is pretty much the same which is Tea. 

I think this place is just average nothing that pops up and making you want to come here just to get milk tea or tea drinks. If you happen to be in the area and wanted to get milk tea then this would be your only choice. I mean it's not bad.

I order Sago Mango Green Tea and they ran out of sago and its only 5pm.. how can you ran out of one of your main ingredient that is in the drink and on the title of the drink and on top of that they have many sago drink in the menu.. come on, stuck up especially when it's summer time.

Drink wise, I like it because I'm Green tea lover sometimes I add mango taste to it, make it refreshing green tea drink."
128,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-23,2019-05-23,2,"It's only worth 1 star better comparing to those old American-style-bubble-tea-shops that making bubble tea with powders not real milks. 2019 and still providing those old items really makes it becomes a sad place. I left Gong Cha today because their oats were out of stock, but when I got here I realized that CoCo doesn't even have that choice from the beginning."
128,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-23,2018-12-04,3,"Fixing for bubble tea around Grand Central, this place hits the spot. 

They're fast in making the drinks. When you pay, your drink is completed, and the drink is tasty and boba has a good consistency. I've tried their milk tea and mango yakult drinks, and they're both good.

This location has 3 small tables with a few chairs and a bench to enjoy your drink indoors, but the space is still pretty tight, of course, it's in the city!"

I had one in my building and the vibe and customer attention friendliness attentiveness does not even compare! I was greeted so warmly and you could just feel that they were all so happy to help locate my mobile order! I will go out of my way to come to this Starbucks from now on

The barista took my order within 2 minutes of me standing on line. I had my cold brew in my hand within the next minute. I do understand why some of these reviews are bad. The baristas were chit chatting rather than processing the few orders they had. I suppose if I had ordered a more complicated order and had to wait around longer, i'd be annoyed too. 

There were enough seats for a Saturday morning, but for such a busy area since it is near Radio City, there isn't a ton of seats. This Starbucks is right in front of Halal Guys so I imagine it does get quite busy here."
129,starbucks-new-york-228,2018-09-26,3,"This starbucks was conveniently located right next to Halal Guys, and so we decided to stop by to get some drinks after eating. The order went through quickly and we got our drinks. The workers were pretty nice, so no compaints there. However, the place needed some serious cleaning. The trash was also overflowing, and the workers were just fooling around with a friend that came in to hang out. They weren't even busy. 
Most people just ordered their drinks and were on their way, but we sat down for a while to finish our drinks. There are only enough seating for maybe around 7-10 people. Unfortunately, this starbucks did not have a public restroom. The nearest one from this location was the restroom in the hilton hotel across the street. Overall, this isn't what I expected for a starbucks in NYC, but I guess it was an experience."
129,starbucks-new-york-228,2018-04-11,5,Quick efficient and reliable.  Friendly and full service.   Easy access and all the expected Starbucks drinks and food.
129,starbucks-new-york-228,2017-11-18,1,"Terrible service and.....they weren't even busy. Add to that their rudeness and this was one of the worst Starbucks experiences I've ever had. After being blown away by great service at Tommy Bahama last night, I guess my expectations for NY got distorted. #nastyin NYC"
129,starbucks-new-york-228,2017-06-29,5,Starbucks is on pretty much every block in the city but I find myself coming to this location a lot. Always quick lines and lots of seating inside.
129,starbucks-new-york-228,2015-11-26,1,"I had the displeasure of encountering a very unprofessional Starbucks barista at this location. Horrible customer service. There are several other Starbucks right in the same area, go there! I went in today to order a drink with no whip cream. The barista made it with the whip. People make mistakes, I know. However, I was absolutely stunned by what he did next. Instead of remaking the drink like I've experienced at other Starbucks, he grabs it back and proceeds to hastily SPOON OUT THE WHIP and then rushed to put the cap back on carelessly, spilling some of my drink on the counter. I have been a long time Starbucks customer, but this guy clearly needs to brush up on his professionalism and service or go work somewhere else. What if I had been allergic to whip or any other ingredient for that matter, you don't just go scoop it out. Not okay."
129,starbucks-new-york-228,2015-10-11,2,"One of the longest wait in town... It seems they could be organized a lot better. If you  go during rush hours, your safest bet is the good old black coffee :-)"
129,starbucks-new-york-228,2015-07-06,4,"Coming to Starbucks next to the hotel I'm staying and I'm surprise that its not busy around 8a.m. However, weekends and afternoon to closing, its jammed packed.

I ordered my usual unsweeted ice black tea with strawberry juice and the flavoring taste powerful that it taste really good.

Very impressed with the service I got and it was quick!

Suggest to get your Starbucks fixed when it opened before 9a.m. to my fellow travelers."
129,starbucks-new-york-228,2014-08-22,2,"Always a long line at the 830- 9 am time frame in a weekday. I suggested going to the  Starbucks across the street.

129,starbucks-new-york-228,2014-07-25,5,Best Starbucks in NYC! We were in the city for a week and they knew my order by the end of the week! They are awesome!
129,starbucks-new-york-228,2014-04-04,2,"Perhaps I spoke too soon.  Over the last two weeks, the service has dropped dramatically, especially in the afternoons.  My most recent experience, prompting this review, resulted in a 10 minute for a hot chocolate which I noticed was not even two-thirds full when I got back to my office.  Extremely inconsistent service, especially in the afternoons."
129,starbucks-new-york-228,2013-12-26,4,"Although it gets very crowded in the morning, I still love this location! The staff are all friendly and remember my name and my drink. Sometimes it takes a little longer than usual to get my drink, but that's to be expected at a Starbucks in NYC at 8:30am. The only thing I don't like about this place is the amount of tourists...they slow the line down so much and take forever to order. Without them, it would be a perfect location!"
129,starbucks-new-york-228,2013-03-20,2,"This Starbucks is actually located in my office building... I happened to have just gone this morning.

The layout is pretty awful - you walk in, greeted by a long line snaking around a good half of the store.  In the winter, it gets cold.

My friend ordered a apple cider and it took at least 15 minutes for her to get her drink because they completely forgot about it - and this isn't even the first time.

For the most part, the cashiers are friendly, but sometimes I wonder.  I had a reward for a free macchiato, and I don't think the cashiers are trained very well to understand coupons/rewards, etc.

This location is good for a quick stop, but there's also a Starbucks across the street at the Hilton, diagonally across in the FT building, and one on 52 between 6 and 7."
130,pit-stop-new-york,2020-06-27,5,This place provides healthy juice/smoothies with quality ingredients. I'm glad it's re-opened!
130,pit-stop-new-york,2019-09-27,2,"Meh. Don't bother. Not bad, but not good either. There are plenty of juice bars in the neighborhood where you can spend the same $10 and get something that's actually delicious."
130,pit-stop-new-york,2019-06-30,1,"This place is the pits.  Smoothies taste like chemicals and management refuses to refund / remake even after they acknowledge it tastes terrible (because they tasted it!!). Spend your $10+ on a smoothie (!!!) elsewhere, I will."
130,pit-stop-new-york,2019-04-28,5,Addicted to the smoothies and go totally out of my way to stop by and get one every week. A bit pricey but worth it!
130,pit-stop-new-york,2019-03-07,5,The very best juice bar in the area . It can be a little pricey but the ingredients are quite fresh and the staff in particular Ubaldo is always very polite and fast . Also it helps that it is located inside a gym son that the schedule is quite convenient.
130,pit-stop-new-york,2017-04-05,5,"Such a pleasant vibe here. The guys at the counter are always so friendly (I have to make it a point to start getting names). Located literally right next to Crunch and have a wonderful selections of Smoothies, Juices, and healthy treats. Everything seems fresh. The only thing I wish they had was Smoothies with peanut butter or almond butter. But they're consistently fast and efficient which I really appreciate."
130,pit-stop-new-york,2017-04-01,1,Drink was fine. Wifi is absolutely awful. I walked in and said I was there to work for an hour. I was the ONLY person in there and it took 3 minutes per page to load! I let them know that I believe their wifi is not working correctly. They oh we don't know anything about that. They didn't care at all. Bad customer service.
130,pit-stop-new-york,2017-03-20,5,Ten stars to this place. The owner is always smiling. She's consistent. She heated up my boiled egg. Lol . This place is a great go to all day in the summer and after a great work out. The employees are very professional.
130,pit-stop-new-york,2016-12-30,3,"Went here to grab a quick smoothie after work. It is connected to crunch, but has quite a bit of seating.

Surprisingly, they did not have many selections for protein shakes, but rather just added protein powder to existing smoothies on the menu.

Suffice to say, to get protein added to my banana and peanut butter shake it cost $10+--so a bit on the pricy side--and it was not anything mind-blowing in terms of flavor."
130,pit-stop-new-york,2016-08-15,4,"Very good shakes. I dont remember the name of the drink I had but it consisted of avocado, kale, celery and something else. The celery overpowered the drink so once I got to work I added some oj to it. It was a lot better after that. The only reason I took one star away was because they werent open on time and I ended up being a little late for work. Other than that, great place and the shakes give you energy!!"
130,pit-stop-new-york,2016-08-01,5,"I wanted to write a review on how great they were with food allergies! I told them I have various allergies to fruits & veggies commonly used (strawberry, pear, celery, carrots to name a few) and they washed the blender again before making my smoothie (champ camp)  although it had already been washed. Super appreciative as many places give problems for those with numerous food allergies!!"
130,pit-stop-new-york,2015-08-29,5,Best turkey burger patties!! Also really great shakes - I love stopping here after a hard workout downstairs at crunch
130,pit-stop-new-york,2014-07-20,4,This place is awesome! The variety of fresh juice is great. Their menu is full of delicious combinations. Everytime I order the juices are made perfectly. I've tried a few of their items off of the food menu. Not really my place to eat a good meal though. Decent for a quick snack otherwise stick with the juices.
130,pit-stop-new-york,2013-11-13,5,"It's right next to Crunch gym on 2nd Ave. After working out, I go to this place and cool down with shot of wheat grass and Myoplex Protein drink. There are lots of empty seats inside of the store. When I tried to lose my weight, I usually drank purple passion for a meal. It is made of blueberry, grapefruit, apple, and ginger. It gives me some energy. But I've never tried food there."
131,pret-a-manger-new-york-88,2019-11-18,3,"OK, not great.  Not as good as it used to be.  I like breakfast at Pret and sometimes things aren't ready to go before 7:00.  Aside from occasional grounds in the pot, reliably good coffee."
131,pret-a-manger-new-york-88,2019-10-07,5,"I am not here to review Pret! Most of us have tried at least one item from their menu. They're all over the city. I am heat to review their carrot cookie. I don't usually go for cookies when I'm craving something sweet, but today the service young lady said you should try our carrot cookie. I love carrot cake! A carrot cookie? Didn't know what to expect. It is very moist, not too sweet, the taste is perfect! It literally melts down in your mouth. It is not too big, yet pleases your sugar craving! It is officially my favorite desert on their menu."
131,pret-a-manger-new-york-88,2019-08-09,2,The only reason this Pret location is getting 2 stars is because the food is fresh and delicious. Their staff on the other hand is horrible. They are very lazy and just stand around. I went to the open register to pay and the employee literally looked at me like I ruined her day by wanting to pay for my items. She also said nothing the whole time. Terrible customer service.
131,pret-a-manger-new-york-88,2018-07-05,1,"Only giving one star because their soups are actually good but customer service is the absolute WORST.

They did not have proper displays up for their products so I grabbed the wrong soup mistakenly. When I got to my office I quickly realized and went back to make an exchange.

When I explained the situation, the employees gave me eye rolls, told me to look closer next time and that it didn't matter that they didn't have the correct sign up, putting the blame on the customer. They gave me the exchange and told me to leave. Will not be coming back again and I hope no one else receives such terrible customer service."
131,pret-a-manger-new-york-88,2018-05-31,4,"Pret. Can't really go wrong.
Among the swarm of salad bars and delis all over the city, there are many places that do great breakfast and lunch. But Pret, is Pret. It never fails. You get to know Pret like a close friend. You know what to expect, and they don't let you down. Plus, they keep it exciting with new menu items throughout the seasons. Service can be mixed, depending on location and how busy they are. But it's always an easy, quick transaction. This newest location is large with more seating than most, and as always, organized and clean. 

Tip - Some things are steep in price. ie; soups
Tip - Salads are such a good value for the quality!
Tip - Summertime means Lobster rolls/salads!"
131,pret-a-manger-new-york-88,2018-05-27,3,"So me and a few coworkers came here on grand opening day for free breakfast, free lunch, beverages and coffee.  Great deal!!! The chicken & avocado sandwich was delicious, which would've cost $8.   The thing is.. I went the very next morning (the 2nd day it was open) to actually buy breakfast and had a question about the coffee.  3 of the staff were just standing around chatting among themselves by that coffee area. I politely asked them if they could help me answer a quick question.  They basically ignored me the first time , then told me to wait the second time.  Waited for a whole 2 minutes with no response, not even eye contact, a nod or a finger indicating to hang out another minute.  I was never to be seen here again"
131,pret-a-manger-new-york-88,2018-05-23,4,"went and scored a souvenir bag for the grand opening.

brought a decent  tuna salad sandwich."
132,starbucks-ny,2019-09-07,3,"Very disorganized and messy.  Not up to Starbucks standards.  Rushed us out and we're paying customers.  Not a friendly staff,  but coffee was good."
132,starbucks-ny,2019-05-13,1,"This place is turning into a literal homeless shelter now that Starbucks lets anyone and everyone come in, sit, use their facilities, without having to buy anything. It's a win for political correctness, but a loss for anyone who wants a good cup of coffee in a welcoming environment. I'll happily return one Starbucks gets out of the social services business, and gets back into being a coffee shop."
132,starbucks-ny,2019-03-16,4,Cleanest Starbucks I've been to in a while. Very well lit and friendly staff. They have a nice communal couches and the customers tend to be professional and trendy.
132,starbucks-ny,2018-12-11,3,"Glad I didn't read the reviews before popping in.
We came mid afternoon, prior to an afternoon showing of Wicked.

Staff seemed the normal ditzy, didn't hear the hubby ask for a donut.
Coffees came out just fine.

Definitely crowded, and people are looking for placed to sit.

All in all a good little respite for us."
132,starbucks-ny,2018-10-13,1,Not a good experience at this location. Four team members at the counter and I was the only customer at the counter. They were all too busy on their phones. After paying they did not make my drink until I went up and asked about it 6 minutes later?
132,starbucks-ny,2018-08-17,4,"Review only for mobile orders. Consistent and good when ordering mobile. They haven't made a mistake yet. Even when crowded, the staff is quite efficient. One of the better Starbucks. If only there were no strange or homeless characters then it would be a 5 star"
132,starbucks-ny,2018-08-06,3,"Decent amount of seating, but usually crowded and kind of slow. Also full of tourists. Head to 8th ave for less crowded locations!"
132,starbucks-ny,2018-06-15,4,"Nice quiet clean location with a large mural on the wall..the staff was very polite as I was only there to purchase ethos water and Madeline cookies. 
It was a quiet retreat in the middle of everything"
132,starbucks-ny,2017-10-20,1,"I just left. It is Friday at 6 am. Whichever employee was helping me out (African American, fake lashes, beanie. She did not have a name tag) was rude and impatient. Her manner from the beginning was unfriendly. Then, instead of simply telling me out loud that I was trying to insert my credit card into the wrong machine, she just made a vague gesture toward where the correct one was. I had to ask her what she was trying to tell me.
I don't know your life, I don't know what you go through on a daily basis. But I've never, in any state, had a Starbucks employee act that way before. Rude."
132,starbucks-ny,2017-06-30,5,"Beautiful, clean and airy when you first walked in. Great service. Quick. Great and comfortable seating making you want to stay all day. Tons of room to work.  One of the nicest Starbucks I've been in."
132,starbucks-ny,2017-06-25,1,I visited many Starbucks and this is the worst service I have ever received.  Negative stars is right! However they do have one bright spot in all the rudeness and incompetence. Her name is Maggie. WORST SERVICE EVER!
132,starbucks-ny,2017-06-09,1,"Probably the worst Starbucks service ever, one of the customers was asking them if they can please check on his order because he is getting late for work , and as soon as he left the manager turned and said to the barista "" if they are getting late for work they shouldn't come here to buy the coffee "", very rude , and when I asked for my order that was placed online she said she can't find it because the machine was broken 10 minutes ago , mind you she saw me waiting there and didn't even bother to ask what I am waiting for !"
132,starbucks-ny,2017-03-20,3,"This is one of the poorest Starbucks I've been to. It is never clean. Some of the staff are good but the other day I came in and there was a long line. Out of three employees only one was taking orders. One was desultorily restocking the area by the cash register and one was just standing around as the line grew longer.  Really bad service. 

And their bathrooms are filthy. I expect better from Starbucks."
132,starbucks-ny,2017-02-11,1,If I could give nothing I would....the rudest bunch on employees! I watched the guy making our drinks just throwing everything around and didn't call by name or put sleeves on leaving customers to just fend for themselves ....and the drinks were terrible! I guess that's not a shock
132,starbucks-ny,2016-12-17,5,Very Nice Peeps Work Here!! :D And I Luv the Atmos!! Plus!!.. open later than most other ones these days! ;)
132,starbucks-ny,2016-11-29,4,I like Starbucks. This one is pretty quick with the orders. Today I ordered a hot mint tea and am iced water.  They made both perfectly.
132,starbucks-ny,2016-10-25,1,"Worst service ever. They've never gotten a single drink right. The staff is clearly underqyalified. If you're not sure of what a customer ordered, ask again, don't just assume. Never going back."
132,starbucks-ny,2016-10-11,1,"If I could give negative stars that would be pretty great. 

To start off, when you walk in the employees look confused. I came in on a morning where there was no line, I was not greeted until I yelled to one of the employees to see if I could order. The excuse for not taking my order was "" oh I didn't know you wanted to order."" Really!! Why else would I be waiting at the register. 

I think Starbucks is good but they should do a better job at many of there locations."
132,starbucks-ny,2016-09-03,1,"Ok where to even begin...  Be wary traveller, for this Starbucks looks like the others, and from the onset you can be fooled by simply ordering, and paying for your order. Everything goes down the poopchute after they have your cash...  My Wife and I were walking by and decided to stop in for a few iced green teas and a bathroom break after a walk through Central Park. I went to the bathroom while she ordered. Patron after patron left the bathroom saying to those waiting their turn ""don't go in there man"" 

Finally it was my turn, and they were soooooo right. I walked through the threshold into a sea of piss and funk for which I can't describe. I will tell you that the smell brought a tear to my eye and I made an appointment the next day for a hepatitis test. It was so bad that I had to not only learn like my predecessors had done but take matters in my own hands. When I opened my door to leave this seventh shade of hell my Wife was in the line...  Time to get to making this pile of funk a place my wife could squat with confidence!!

I shut down the disgusting bathroom myself, and went to the counter to report my horrifying experience to them. I asked and was told they would fix it, the guy I spoke to shouted out ""Hey new girl get the mop!!!"" To my surprise, she said no and they fought a bit. 

I went back to find out the next girl in line had gone in, she came back out with a look like she had seen too much. She also mentioned between dry heaves that there was NO toilet paper.

I went back to check out status, still no action. I went to the manager and asked her to fix the problem. She sighed and yelled for the same girl.

She came with the mop finally when it was my wife's turn, she held her breath as she went in, for 10 mins she fiddled with the toilet paper dispenser then took 10  more mopping up the most vile poop water you ever saw. When she was done she walked out of a semi-clean bathroom with a brutally disgusting mop and proceeded to drag it through the whole restaurant leaving a trail of foul smelling funk through the whole restaurant. She put the nasty mop behind the serving area...

I let the guy at the counter know, he told the girl who did it and she looked at the smear and actually said ""yeah I don't give a f*ck!""

I don't think anyone ""gives a f*ck"" at this Starbucks beware you my wind up with a Vente case of dissantry!"
132,starbucks-ny,2016-08-26,1,What is it with Starbucks always hiring incompetent people? Is it too hard to make a goddamn iced Americano. Don't even get me started on the contemptuous employees.
132,starbucks-ny,2016-07-24,1,"I love Starbucks. However, this location just became the worst Starbucks experience I've ever encountered. Still in disbelief about the bad experience, I mean, it's Starbucks. How can they act so ignorant and take 15 min to prepare my wrongfully made Strawberry Acai Refresher? When asked for a side of venti iced water on the side because of the hot weather, cashier gives this dirty look and says nothing. Shit I'll pay for water if you think I should! Need better customer experience training and how-to-make-beverage-correctly-training OR fire these horrible employees. Definitely not up to the standard most of other Starbucks chains out there. I'm writing his review on July 24th 2016. I see 2 African American employees (1 female and 1 male, female was the cashier) and they look Starbucks look bad."
132,starbucks-ny,2016-05-27,1,I was just denied ice in my water. They said they not allow to give ice in regular water cup if I didn't purchase anything. First Starbucks that ever said some shi$$ like this
132,starbucks-ny,2016-03-03,1,"Worrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsssssssssssssssssssssssssstttttttttttttttttt!!!!!! Starbucks everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!! I can't believe I have been an entire afternoon in the store and I wanted a refill and they refused to do it because they did not take my order!!! Off course they did not!! I bought my coffee like 3 hours before their shift!!!!!
Both girls very rude!!!! In both shifts! 
I have a Starbucks card and they did not helped me scanning the card!!! not kind, not friendly, CARELESS. They should dedicate to package food or something NOT RELATED AT ALL WITH PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
132,starbucks-ny,2016-02-18,3,"I used to visit the church across from this Starbucks and get whatever my heart desired.  They can get packed on Sundays because the church is pretty big.  Depends on who is the barista, your service will vary.

My reason for the 3 stars is based on cleanliness and service.  They didn't seem to mess up my drink so it's all good!  This Starbucks could be a little cleaner but the staff is too busy having a very long chat.  I stood waiting for someone to take my order for a while.  Cashier saw me but decided to walk away without saying a word.."
132,starbucks-ny,2015-11-04,1,"I can't believe this they have 6 employees take care of customers and they forgot to make my drink , but the conversation between each other they don't miss, and they think that with just a apology is ok  
Just for the management to see I was there  here is the pic
Ps the sandwich was cold by the time I get the coffee"
132,starbucks-ny,2015-10-13,4,"My frap is kicking some major ass this morning! 

Although this Starbucks located right on Broadway...they were very well stocked....friendly and willing to customize and change your order if you are displeased with something...I especially liked that they were efficient even during rush hour...when everyone wants there coffee fixed...lots of seats...bathrooms pretty disgusting...opens till mid night! love it!"
132,starbucks-ny,2015-10-11,1,Horrible. The guy taking out the trash didn't believe I bought something and would not let me use the restroom. Should I have to hold onto my receipt after I get my drink? I just couldn't believe his rudeness. He should be fired bc of his pathetic attitude. I'll forgive his unprofessional appearance but his tone was a shame.
132,starbucks-ny,2015-10-10,2,"We got OK service except for the lovely smashed pain au chocolat. I would not have served that to a customer, I would have tossed it out. I guess the speed of the service was ok. I think the only thing this Starbucks really has going for it is the size. Which is a regular size Starbucks anywhere but Manhattan."
132,starbucks-ny,2015-09-11,3,I arrived at 11pm on a Friday night. This Starbucks location is indeed roomy. The restroom is below average but not atrocious. The staff close it at 11:20pm each day which is odd given the store closes 40 minutes later at midnight. There were no itinerants hanging around as suggested by other reviews.
132,starbucks-ny,2015-08-18,4,"This is one of the largest Starbucks I visited in NYC.  Starbucks are everywhere in NYC but this has a large storefront with more SB merchandise, seating area.  It's opened late since it's in the Theater district.  The only problem is they put several shelves of merchandise in front of their counter which is obtrusive. I think it's there to market their merchandise but when you have a long line of folks waiting for their coffee, the shelves get in the way.
Bought a NYC SB much for $10.95.  They sell other SB mugs here that I've not see at the other smaller SB stores."
132,starbucks-ny,2015-06-19,5,The manager was amazing! I lost the straw to my venti tumbler and he went out of his way to help me :0)
132,starbucks-ny,2015-05-29,5,"If I have the right place: 51st and Broadway, one of the best, most efficient, and friendly businesses that I have ever seen. 99% of the staff do a fabulous job and their manager, Kevin, is a tremendous asset and workhorse. Come here every day. It is amazing how quick they can clear a crowd of 20+ people and keep the coffee to a high standard.  I wish the lazy flight attendants at the airlines could see what it's like to really work."
132,starbucks-ny,2014-09-28,1,"Worst Starbucks I have ever been to...I'd give a zero if that was possible.
The service was atrocious. I stood at the counter for almost ten minutes without being helped because two of the workers were arguing about some boyfriend that the other slept with. It wasn't until I had to be rude and get their attention that anyone responded.
Being in the vicinity of Rockefeller Center you'd think it would be less ghetto but no...this was straight up a hot mess and a half. 
This place could be such a great Starbucks for the location but the staff needs a major overhaul ASAP."
132,starbucks-ny,2014-07-20,2,"It's a Starbucks, they're basically all the same. Being right near Times Square, this location is particularly touristy, but you can do some nice crazy-people-watching with a seat by the big windows. It's also open later than most of the Starbucks in the area, with the exception of the one on 55th/7th. The wifi is also pretty good, assuming too many people aren't trying to watch Netflix. 

The biggest problem with this location is that it's often full of non-customers loitering, so it's not ideal for chilling/working. It's sad that the homeless folks in our city lack places to go, but it doesn't make for a pleasant Starbucks environment when people are rooting through the trash or around the floor for change. The employees shouldn't have to police the store, but they also don't do much to discourage non-customers from detracting from the experience of customers. I feel like a jerk for saying this, but it's the reason I don't often visit this Starbucks location."
132,starbucks-ny,2014-03-13,5,"I wouldn't normally write a review about a Starbucks - it's a chain, they're all the same - but this one has the best staff I've seen! It's a small store, but the line moves quickly and the staff is really pleasant."
132,starbucks-ny,2014-03-03,1,"I would give 0 stars if I could. This location is hands down the most poorly managed Starbucks in midtown. I understand that they have to deal with a lot of foreign tourists, however the lack of organization is astounding. There is no indication of where the line begins or where it should go in the store which leads to lots of line cutting by people who are either pushy or confused. I have never seen so many employees working behind the counter at any other Starbucks and yet at 8:50am with a line practically out the door there was only one barista actually making the drinks! Incredible. 

Basically, if you're an actual New Yorker who works in midtown and needs to get coffee and get to work on time avoid this location!"
132,starbucks-ny,2013-09-24,4,Another Starbucks.. coffee is consistent and the space is decent. Service here was quick so not much to say .. ANOTHER Starbucks ;-)
132,starbucks-ny,2013-09-19,5,"My favourite Midtown West Starbucks, the staff are great, they manage the morning coffee line with aplomb politely managing the tourists working their way through the breakfast menu and the regulars who just want their coffee and to be on their way to the office.
They remember your name, your order and smile which considering they have clearly been up a few more hours than I have is an amazing thing.  Many other Starbucks should rotate staff into this store to see how it is done.
Thank you"
132,starbucks-ny,2013-04-17,4,"Has a Clover brewer and serves the reserve coffees (which are good, if overpriced compared to NYC competition like blue bottle). The long wooden tables give some atmosphere and are good to talk across. Line is in the middle of the store, which is a decent layout. Overall, one of the better Starbucks I've been to."
132,starbucks-ny,2013-02-25,4,"The 1656 Broadway Starbucks is right by Mamma Mia. It really pretty and looks rather new. The lighting is fantastic - it has corner windows. 

I haven't tried the wi-fi. The drinks are standard and the line moves quickly in the morning. There's a good amount of seating for people who need to while away some time. At 9:00 am, I didn't observe the issue that the filtered reviewer below saw.

The line moves quickly and my drink was made properly, so no complaints here!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2020-03-17,4,"I ordered delivery from here for the first time today. I ordered the Belgian waffle (comes with fresh fruit), Belgian mocha with almond milk, mini carrot cake (vegan), the breakfast sandwich with an add of bacon, and the Belgian chocolate brownie. Everything arrived warm. The Belgian mocha spilled in transit which kinda sucks. It tastes like a bad hot chocolate lol. I won't be reordering this drink.
The sandwich had an organic egg, avocado, cheddar cheese, bacon (I added), chipotle mayo on brioche. The brioche was perfectly toasted. The egg perfectly seasoned and fried. Cheese melted. Bacon a little crunchy. Avocado was fresh. Chipotle mayo was a nice touch to tie in the flavors. Great sandwich! I'd recommend trying this one.
The Belgian waffle was also delicious! Fresh strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. The waffle was perfectly cooked; sweet with a crunch on the outer edges. I would absolutely order this again and recommend you try it! Yummmmmm!
The vegan mini carrot cake was a miss. I could taste the carrot which was the only good thing and it had pumpkin seeds on top. Skip this, unless you're vegan and like it? It's not for me. It was very firm. I won't order it again.
The Belgian chocolate brownie now....oh my! Decadent. Soft center and crunchy outer shell. Perfect size. Rich chocolate flavor. Excellent. Try this one! Worth it lol.
Overall the prices are not bad. I'm happy!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2020-02-25,4,"We loved this place for breakfast! We sat upstairs in full seating, and the food was delicious and the ambience is awesome. I read all the reviews about slow service and we did not find that to be the case and our server was attentive and accommodating. HOWEVER! My mom came back for a coffee in the afternoon (downstairs - order at the counter) and waited patiently behind a man who was paying for his order in change. One of the employees said she'd help my mom at the next register and after she placed her order was told rudely that they don't take cash at that register and that she had to pay by credit card. If the employees can't be nice then I suggest having a clear sign on the register indicating ""credit card only"". And being nice might have earned her a tip."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2020-02-19,5,"Fabulous place for guac and avo deli delights. I enjoy going there for their zucchini  salad as well. 

Highly recommend!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2020-02-15,5,"So, keeping it real, the server asked us to write a review.  But, fine, it was a great experience.  He had red hair, in case you come across him.  But to get to the point, this is a great Pain Q.  The food was as awesome, as always.  I had the smoked salmon breakfast with poached egg which was the perfect way to start the day.  Fresh salmon, creamy ricotta, perfectly cooked egg and that great bread!  Service by our red-haired server (sorry, I forgot his name, but he was charming) was EXCELLENT.  He was attentive, and conversational in a good way.  I love coming here.  The food and the ambiance never disappoint."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2020-01-01,1,"This place is horrible. Food is decent, service is atrocious. Took wayyyy too long for a waiter to take our order. We had to wait an incredibly long time for breakfast menu items. When we were served, one of our orders was wrong and the waitress was barking at us that it was our fault. Food was cold. I tipped 10%, but really should have tipped 5% or nothing at all, commensurate with the attention and service we received. Nice dining space, but waste of a business... never coming back."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-12-17,5,"Our server, Michael S. was kind and funny. He made our dining experience enjoyable. He was helpful and efficient and is a great server!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-12-16,1,"The food is good at this location, but service fails every single time. 
From how long it takes to prepare your food, to nasty comments of the people behind the register - they make you feel like they are doing you a favor. Questions are brushed off, accusatory tone of voice if you ordered through an app. 
This is literally 90% of my experience at this location. And it's a shame, because I do like this food and would have been a regular if service was up to standards."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-12-08,1,"If you come to this location and pay with credit card make sure you get your credit card back!

I came here on Friday and paid for my coffee with a credit card and the employee that completed my transaction never returned my card (shame on me for being distracted enough to not realize I didn't get it back). 

Later that day, there were charges exceeding $1000 on my credit card from Bergdorf Goodman (a couple of blocks from this location). 

Ive since reported the fraud and will be contacting the police."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-10-23,3,"This restaurant was very cute inside and felt like I was transported back in time in France when I walked in. Sadly, it took me much longer to get my food than anticipated, which has happened to me as well at other Le Pains I have been to. The food was pretty good, but greatly overpriced."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-10-08,1,"I had been to the Pain Quotidien a number of years ago on Lexington and around 60th street.  I have memories of a very tasty smoke salmon and caper tartine... Now the prices seem to have gone up.  For $13.99 I ordered a Tuna Nicoise, which for some reason I thought would have some slices of braised fresh tuna on it. I guess I did not read the menu closely enough.  It was essentially canned 'line-caught"" tuna on bread with slices of hard boiled egg on it.  The bread and tuna was entirely soaked in something very vinegary and salty plus capers and gherkin pickles.....The net effect was like a disappointing open-face soggy tuna sandwich.  (I would have preferred the old style mayonnaise kind).  It didn't really resemble a real tuna nicoise salad, which I normally love.

Being a Belgian chain, I thought the wine by the glass would be tasty (It's certainly possible to have appealing 'house wines' at a reasonable price).  My brother ordered a merlot blend and found it wasn't very good.  I ordered a sauvignon blanc, which definitely was not French as I thought it might be and not so good in flavor. I exchanged it for a chardonnay which was almost watery and also very mediocre.  My brother had the turkey and avocado tartan also for $13.99 which he said was ""not very good"".  I would say it was an overpriced lunch given the food quality. The service, however,  was good."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-09-21,1,The noxious fumes of their floor cleaner overwhelmed me when I entered. The scent lingers and is distracting. I don't plan on returning to this location
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-09-12,5,"This is my daily breakfast, sometimes lunch, and afternoon snack place. It is true that in the past, the service was a bit slow, however, their manager Maria has made terrific changes in the quality of service. The food is of a very good quality, tasty and super fresh. I truly enjoy coming here and I will continue coming because they care about their customers and go out of their way to make my experience very pleasant!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-09-10,3,"This restaurant is ideally located and has a very great atmosphere. It is the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of New York City and the food is quite tasty! I ordered a roasted turkey and avocado sandwich while here and the sandwich tasted wonderful! There was a honey glaze that they put on the sandwich and I wish they had put less as at times it was quite overpowering and drowned out the flavors of the turkey and avocado! While the food was great here, I was quite disappointed with the service. The waiter never refilled my water glass until I flagged him down and asked him to refill the glass, nor did he ask my guest and I whether our food was good! When it came time to pay he took quite some time to bring over this digital system that you pay on and just left it at the table without showing us how to use it. I was very disappointed by the service here which is the reason for the 3 stars, the food however was excellent!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-08-05,1,I came here two times. The place very comfortable. But the service still very Bad . No cashier help to order . After when I ask someone for help me to put order. The service face like don't bother me. I will not go anymore.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-07-21,5,"Awesome place. Nice small sitting area in a park with an artificial waterfall right next to it. Great to escape for a couple of minutes from all the typical NYC hectic.

Prices are fair; food is awesome. Saw Rishy B's negative comment. Yes sir welcome to NYC, taxes, staff etc... that all gotta be payed, of course basic items are more expensive then anywhere else. You pay more for similar items at every Starbucks nationwide btw. This place isn't even overpriced, it's away from typical tourist crowds and just nice to go there and relax for a bit."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-07-16,1,"Can't believe it's so expensive ! Come on , it's bread!!!! This is called stealing ordinary people."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-07-07,4,If you are looking with a ample space where you can sit and stay for hours with a bathroom this is your place to go. We all know how difficult can be to find a place in NYC with this characteristics. It's a safe options and you can find them all over the city. I normally order the fresh lemonade.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-07-06,5,"Wow, food was good. my server Evan asked me if i would mind writing a review. He seemed like a cool dude. like a guy that plays guitar or something. Is he in a band? Whats his deal? he was really efficient and did his job well. Had good conversation about dolphins vs whales, not gonna lie it filled me with joy. Should i feel embarrassed to write that. Whatever he was great. kinda digged his vibe. He a 9 for sure."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-06-01,1,"So disappointing. Pancakes were stone cold (obviously made well in advance of
Our order). Butter was freezing cold. Eggs (normally a sure thing at Pain Quotedien) were overdone. NOT up to even minimal standards for the price."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-04-17,1,"Service is not the best I'm really sorry for the waiter because their are 5 waiters and 3 of them are white and didn't move and the other two are black and are running around I thought we would be all familiar that everybody is the same and should be treated the same no matter which skin color you have. The two stars goes only to the 2 waiters and the food the other should learn a lesson I hope that le pain Quotidien Manager will see this and change that because that is really disappointing
Day 2 manager is here she is working really hard to please everyone today was worse than yesterday we where waiting for the food for so long. People are leaving because they where not getting served or the waiter didn't come to bring their food. Food was ready but no one picked it up to bring so when we received it it was cold. Even though the manager was here no one of the waiters really cared but some did but not everyone. The manager was the best of even all the waiters together."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-04-12,3,"I came here for a quick bite before a concert yesterday evening.  The food was typical of any other installment of this brand - freshly prepared and tasty.  The service upstairs in the dining area was shockingly lackluster.  The one server working was unable to do anything efficiently and despite the table service area being less than a quarter full he was running around the whole time, but accomplishing little.  My order was incorrect, I waited 15 minutes for the beverage I ordered (tap water!), and he seemed unable to handle the few customers that were there.  

They need to step up their efficiency, and ensure that servers understand some fundamentals about greeting a guest and seeing to their needs when they arrive - lest things back up while errors must be corrected.  I'm not expecting fussiness here, just a modicum of efficiency that can make everyone's experience (server or diner) better."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-04-03,4,"Cute little place. The community tables are great! Our server was busy. It appeared that he was the only one working at in the seated area. 

The food was great! Our group had 4 different items, each were prepared great!  For a chain place, it was OK.  We'd all go back!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-02-07,3,"Staff has always been friendly and helpful but, as a restaurant manager, I must say your bathrooms are disgusting! If you know your customer volume then you should have a system in place to maintain cleanliness 
I have subsequently been in a few more times and have noticed a remarkable improvement in the cleanliness of the bathrooms. Thank you! The service and the quality of your product still remain superb so I'd like to rate 5 stars."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2019-01-27,4,Got here about 9:30 on a Sunday. Was nice and quiet enough to get a seat and have a conversation. We ordered 2 small pots of coffee which equated to about 2 large cups each. About $4 per pot. Really nice and rich coffee. I got the steel cut oatmeal which was nice and very filling. Pretty big bowl. About $9. Also ordered the cute little mini pancakes with maple syrup. About $9. Good size portions and good food. Nice attentive server named Pa. Wish we had one where we live. Will deff go back. Recommend it for a nice little meal. They serve lunch and dinner too.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-12-09,1,"I am pretty much done with this location. I've come here off and on because it is convenient on the way to my office, but service is incredibly slow (you are not doing paying customers a service to get food for them that they ordered), they snicker and make snide remarks about their customers as if they are too stupid to realize, and even the manager is snide and off-putting. He either purposely misspelled my name wrong previously or is extremely incompetent. It is not very difficult to spell ""Victor"", yet he comes up with some name that wasn't even close to what I stated. Apparently only certain people are supposed to be able to eat in this location. I am of mixed background and I suppose that it is shocking to the workers in this place that I can afford to eat here (yes I can, imagine that) and it is disgusting how they treat people, all the while insinuating that you can't afford to eat here and shouldn't."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-12-08,5,"Always a great experience

Great coffee, delicious bakery, breakfast and lunch options. 

And nice respite from 5th Avenue"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-10-29,1,"Ordered the breakfast sandwich (egg, cheddar, avocado, chipotle aoili on brioche) without bacon. As in -- I ordered it AS IT IS LISTED ON THE MENU. Server asks if I want bacon amd I say no. Shows up with bacon, and I send it back. 

Would've given 5 stars and a 30% tip (as a former server I can't tip anything less!) if they simply corrected it by remaking my sandwich. Instead, they took off the bacon and gave me the same sandwich back, and the server told me to my face, ""They remade it."" I knew that wasn't true because it was only gone for about 60 seconds, and it *tastes* like bacon. I do not eat any pork products, and now I feel sick. No tip and only 1 star. It wasn't my fault; I wasn't being a difficult customer. I ordered something and the server or cook made an error. It's not absurd for me to ask them to correct their mistake. 

I work across the street and eat here all the time for lunch, but that is so messed up that I will not return because I can no longer trust them.

Service is also insanely slow, unacceptable for busy Manhattan."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-10-28,1,"Very bad service, ordered take out and standing waiting for half an hour. The woman at register didn't even know how to ring the bill. Wasting a lot time asking around. The smallest and most expensive croissant I've ever had. This cost $14:( ......."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-10-27,1,HORRENDOUS service. Have been sitting here for over 30 minutes and have yet to get water. Completely understaffed. Played of food are just sitting there and no one taking them. Our table wasn't cleaned for a good 25 minutes as we just sat there and then waited another 30 to even get water. Go waste your time somewhere else...
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-10-26,2,A disorganized place with super poor service.  They brought my breakfast at the same time they told my wife they were out of hers so she needed to order something else.  She declined. The coffee was good if you're looking for a bright side. Definitely a place to skip.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-10-07,1,"Wow. The worst service ever. The food cane before a simple coffee pot. I was already done with my breakfast. The sandwich was mediocre for $9.99. I wish I had just gone to Starbucks. I'm not the type of person to trash restaurants but I can assure you, I will never go to any of their restaurants again. Like never, ever again. Aargh. Extremely irritating and disappointing."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-08-13,2,"Overpriced food not worth the quality. 
I got the toasted ham and gruyere croissant and was disappointed. The croissant was small/burnt, the entire sandwich was greasy, and the ""salad"" that it came with was just a small pile of leaves drowning in dressing. There was also one waiter serving the entire place...? This seemed to be causing a lot of backup within the restaurant during their busy lunch time. If you are looking for a quick sit down lunch during the week, I'm not sure if this is the place."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-08-13,2,"Positive:  The interior is the only thing giving this place any credibility because it has pretty lighting, paint color, decor.  
Negative: (everything else) Absolutely DISAPPOINTING in all ways.  From the totally untrained and uncaring service staff to the rubbery ""sunny-side"" eggs (how is that even possible?), we could not have been more unhappy with our breakfast.  We noted a few things to our servers, and they really didn't seem to care or know what to do.
This chain used to be a great name, and with grand expansion they ruined it.  So sad.
The only reason we went here was location - across from our friend's gym.  No reason to return for us or them."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-07-05,2,"This bakery chain has pretty good desserts but it's a shame everyone who works there hates their job and it really affects the customers. This location almost ruined my day. If you don't mind some rudeness and attitude, it's fine but i would rather go to another location."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-06-24,4,Cliff notes version:  Great fresh food done well.  It's a charming place to eat if you're not in a hurry.   Kinda surprised its 3 stars and I think I know why.  There's facility issues causing long waits compounded by poorly trained but very nice waitstaff.     For food I think it's 4 star all day long.  I ate up stairs.   They have great coffee and Belgium hot chocolate.  Kudos to them for having GF toast for my avocado toast and hard boiled eggs.  Add the smoked salmon to make it hardy.  It's very noisy as most NYC restaurants. The waitstaff could be more efficient taking one trip instead of multiple trips back and forth and decrease wait times.  Still love the place but the wait is probably why folks rate 3.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-06-18,1,"Food is good and the gluten free bread and items are a godsend in this area of midtown. I go often as I work in the area. But the service is just abysmal. Every single time I go, usually for take out. And everyone just says, 'I'll check on it' and never comes back with an answer, including the managers. You have a problem--wake up"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-06-16,4,"Pros: food, location
Cons: very few outlets, breakfast menu slightly limited

This location right next to 5th Av. is the perfect spot to either take a brunch break from shopping or just start your day strong with some healthy food options. I'm fact, because of the emphasis on healthy foods, you might find the menu lacking in the staple breakfast items like omelette, hash browns, lots of bacon, free coffee refills, etc.

I ordered 2 eggs with the salmon options and it was really delicious, albeit a small portion. Again, emphasis here on keeping things healthy and the calorie count low. I also tried the avocado toast and, listen, if you're going to try anything, it's got to be this one. Just amazing taste! And I was so delightfully surprised when my cappuccino came in a bowl instead of a mug. A little detail that made it fun.

Beware: sometimes people go to breakfast places thinking they can sit down, charge their phone/laptop and chill for a while (myself included). This is not hat kind of place.

TLDR: try the avocado toast, little-to-no outlets available, cappuccino comes in a bowl, which is cool."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-06-03,3,"Not much of a menu, no scrambled eggs, no bagels, no cream cheese and were out of pancakes. The service however was very good and the cappuccino was delicious!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-06-01,3,"This place was okay. The food was spectacular, but the meh service and exorbitant prices really made me question if the food was good enough. My husband loved the breakfast tea and his sandwich and I devoured the delicious Sunny Side Breakfast Bowl. I really didn't care for the ""pot"" of coffee or tea because it was almost $5 for what equals about two cups of coffee when I only wanted one.

I would likely recommend this place for convenience (they're everywhere!), but there are probably better places in the city for either a whole meal or a coffee/snack."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-05-21,5,"Yummy food! Great kids menu. Wonderful escape from the city right outside. I enjoyed my salmon and eggs and the yogurt with granola and fruit was delicious too. Today, customer service was excellent! My 3 year old spilled milk all over and the server was so sweet about it. I highly recommend for breakfast or lunch!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-05-21,5,"This is a great restaurant in NYC for taking lunch , when I went this restaurant,  I had no idea ,what I am going to eat.

I will definitely visit this location again ."

Everything about this meal was sour. Sour salmon, sour avocado, sour dressing on the salad. ""Soft boiled egg"", was hard boiled. It sat on the counter for at least 10 minutes before it was delivered to me.

Chocolate croissant was just OK. Muffins were dry. Coffee was good!

Waitress was doing her best taking orders, bussing, serving food, and running checks. But it was pretty slow because it was just her."

Eventually my husband needed to buy me the 3rd one till I can truly enjoyed my own lemon tart!! You SHALL not miss it!! 
Oh did I say about the communal table?? I will be sad if I can't get to sit on that!!! Gorgeous!!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2018-04-02,1,"This might be the worst run store I have ever been to in Manhattan.  I have worked next door for over 5 years and dread everytime its the most convenient to get a salad or coffee because the employees do not care to help, are not there or will walk by a line of 10 people waiting at the counter and say nothing.  This should be a worst case scenario as not only is the service abysmal but the prices are much higher than most of the stores around it."

(yeah, i know- it's New York City- everything is expensive...but breakfast shouldn't cost 2 people almost $40 )...
maybe the other locations in Manhattan are better- this one was really bad...avoid at all costs..."

133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-10-21,3,"I really like this LPQ because of its location and sheer size and space. It's great for informationals, which I've had in the past. Similarly, it's great for a little break from walking through the city.

Their products are pretty guaranteed, in the sense that you will get what you ordered. No surprises. I love the ambiance.

I was slightly confused which way the line started and what the ordering procedures are. And it's a little funny/addionally confused that LPQ overall won't let you order at the register after you've checked out their food in the food, and will have you sit at a table and wait for a server. Also it's a little to go sitting area was a little not immaculate.

Overall I appreciate LPQ for its solid food and ambiance."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-09-29,5,I love this store. The food is delicious. Employees a very friendly. They use to have an employee by the name Maxim working there at the beginning of this year. He was very energized happy person. Making my drinks the special way. I don't see him there any longer. I give 5 stars for great good and great customer service! Keep it up!!!
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-08-25,4,"A decent Cafe right off of 5th Ave. They had a Cafe downstairs and a full service restaurant upstairs. We sat in the restaurant, it was a nice and relaxed atmosphere and the service was friendly and quick. The food was a bit overpriced and very simple, but good and plenty of gluten free options. I got an open-faced melt that was just ham, cheese, and mustard (the food is simple, as I mentioned). It was good and the gluten free bread was really good, which is always a plus. The restaurant gets four stars because it's certainly nothing special, but it's also not bad at all for a casual lunch or afternoon coffee break. If you're eating your way through Manhattan, don't bother with this place, but if you just want a quick stop on 5th Ave, it's not a bad choice."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-08-15,4,"There is one thing that I absolutely love getting here and that is the avocado toast with a hardboiled egg. It is absolutely delicious. Yes it's pricey, but damn is this place yummy and the quality of the food is amazing! The customer service is always great and I enjoy their changing menu. Their chai is a bit on the bland side, wish it had more taste and was sweeter."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-07-22,4,"I never have bad experiences in any Le Pain Quotidien and I think it's such a cute place to either just grab coffee or go with family & friends. I got the avocado toast since I'm avocado's #1 fan, but to be honest with you, it wasn't what I expected for a $12 avocado toast. It tasted a little bit bitter for my taste and who knows, maybe it's just me but I like to actually taste the avocado, with a little something else, but nothing that changes its flavor."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-07-07,5,Quick. Easy and yummy food. We went to NYC and I had to go there twice! Great avocado toast.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-06-18,5,Wonderful food and a great french country atmosphere.  We had the breakfast skillet and tried a couple of different ones each day we went.  This was quite a surprise place for us but lucky enough it was around the corner from our hotel.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-05-28,1,"The internet connection sucks - I mean AOL dial-up speeds.  That's not an issue if you don't pretend you have internet and then after we purchase coffee, etc wefind out we are at the Motel 6 of coffee shops.  Just say you don't offer internet.  If you can't do that, then you are scamming people who are trying to get some work done.   Maybe this 'fancy name' cafe is just a big cover for a place with store-bought pastries and cheap walmart coffee."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-05-11,5,"They really care about retaining their customers. The five stars are for who I think is a new General Manager, MARIO and the food quality. So like many reviews below, I have experienced it all at this place, I've worked across the street for 5 years and really love the quality of the food, the drinks and especially the baked goods like the bread, brownies and chia muffins (my fav). I have waited about 30 minutes for soft boiled eggs and have been rung up wrong at the register, needless to say, I have been hot and cold about them. 

BUT GIVE THEM ANOTHER TRY... I went in today and they seemed to have corrected all of the issues at the register and online. Before this visit I had actually complained about my last visit, which is something that I hate to do, I just wanted to issue rectified but Mario went above and beyond to make it right. I really appreciate great Client Service, they delivered on this. I'll be back tomorrow morning for my chia muffin and a coffee. 

Thanks Mario and thanks to the rest of management for reading all these reviews and making the necessary improvements where needed. 

I don't want to forget to mention, the place was upgraded a bit, there is now more room for seating on level one, I haven't been upstairs yet but the place looks great and is more inviting then the old layout."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-05-02,1,"*I've been getting coffee from here for the past two years, never had this problem till lately

I hate leaving negative reviews, but this happened two times in a row within one week. The first time was i believe last Wednesday when I ordered a small soy latte to go, stood at the pickup counter waited for about 15 minutes, watched everyone in line with me, even the one behind me in line get there coffee, the crowd started dying down, two tourists walk in and got there oder right at the ordering counter, that's when I realized my coffee is not coming, asked and was told it's coming, then continues waiting for about 5 minutes, guy with blue flannel shirt walked out (only person not wearing uniform so I'm assuming he is a manager or an employee at a higher level), so I told hime the situation, same thing, no apologies, gave me that annoyed look and told me ""ITS COMING"", do you think I enjoyed doing this? Second time was earlier today, decided to order a simple black coffee on ice thinking they can't forget this order this time, nope, same thing, stood there, watched everyone get there coffee, then the three employee just stood there chatting, so i had to walked over and ask if my coffee is coming? then the male barista proceed to ask ""Oh? what did you ordered?""obviously forgotten my order again, and I had to repeat my order which is a simple black coffee on ice, then he asked""what kind of milk?"" Need I say more, I love La Pain Quotidien, but this is honestly the worst experience, the only negative experience I've had with any La Pain Quotidien locations. If I don't work right across the street from it I wouldn't have gone back."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-05-01,4,"This LPQ location is always clean, always bustling without being overly busy, and the ingredients are always fresh. I walk here from my office and almost always get the smoked salmon tartine. There is seating upstairs, but taking things to go generally doesn't take very long, even though it is in the heart of midtown. A great  place for a quick bite!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-04-27,1,Service s**ks. Sat for 15 minutes before anyone one stopped provide a menu. Still waiting for some to clean  the table (they haven't even picked up the last customer CC receipt) from the last customer. They need to get it together. Argh! I hope their food is better than the service.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-04-02,5,"Great spot for brunch. Feels far from the hustle and bustle of 5th Avenue. Warm and friendly staff, great food and importantly the best coffee outside Australia, this is a great place to plan your attack for the day."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-03-18,3,"Light meal choices and a very nice menu. Great bakery case. Service was uneven and slow. 
We had a Tuna (chicken substitute) Cobb salad, Belgian waffle with speculoos and banana, a matcha latte, an americano, and an iced tea lemonade. All delicious. 
We didn't get our beverages served at the same time. Our water never got refilled. I was surprised since when we arrived the area was not full."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-03-01,5,"Delicious  !! Service was great, the taste was unique, and the place is very pleasant. I Highly recommend ."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-02-19,1,"Service is really bad!  Bringing the food before the utensils, and delivering another person's food prior to my utensils.  The actual cobb salad was good, but it took 45 minutes.  I asked for oil and vinegar on the side.  I got a little container of dressing.  When I asked for oil and vinegar the second time, she pointed to the dressing and said ""that's oil and vinegar"".  I then asked for separate oil and separate vinegar.  She pointed to an oil container on the table.  I asked for pepper.  She asked me what kind of pepper?!!?  I said any pepper!  Then she brought me the pepper.  OMG, communication and service.  Really horrible."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-02-10,4,"why does this place only have 3 stars....
I and my four friends had the most hardest time to make decision what they wanted to eat. so many options and all sounded so good. i wasn't sure if i wanted salmon breakfast or egg skillet but i chose egg skillet with avocado and toasted onion! 
very satisfied. the dishes are well ordinated. liked my latte too. also they have a few spreads options on the table for organic breads that most of the dishes come with. try hazelnut. so good!!! also the strawberry thing was yammy!!
loved the atmosphere too."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-01-13,5,Excellent service and quality of food. I highly recommend stopping here after the MoMa!
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-01-08,3,"I came here for a brunch with a fairly large group, however the restaurant was not busy when we arrived. The waiter we had took his time coming to our table and setting up menus and silverware.
Once we ordered, we waited a long time before seeing any food, and the waiters served us two at a time, in no particular order, and over a long stretch of time.
The food itself was very good, but overpriced ($15 for avocado toast?). The service was really what irritated me about the whole experience. We spent a total of two hours in the restaurant, and at least half of that time was waiting for our server."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-01-04,5,"LPQ is my favorite spot to work on my computer and grab lunch! This particular location has great service (Valerie was an excellent waitress!), and their menu is filled with French-inspired dishes. Try the ""Paris Ham & Cheese"" (kind of like a Croque Monsieur - comes with mustards too) and their lemonade (raspberry or original). Their perfectly flaky croissants also take you right back to Paris, if you're looking for a great breakfast!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2017-01-01,1,Desperately understaffed. We should have noticed the dozen people waiting around without food before we ordered. Save yourself an hour and avoid this place.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-12-13,1,"This is perhaps the most disorganized restaurant experience I have ever experienced.
Poor service, rude employees, completely disinterested and apparently unhappy they was so busy.
Thirty minutes to be seated and first remark from hostess, the kitchen was backed up 1/2 hour.
No need to try this chain unless under torture.
Food was ok when it finally came.
No reason to spend money here!!!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-12-07,5,Great spot! Not sure why reviews weren't higher. Cozy neighborhood hangout with an extensive bakery menu. Loved the family style dining table.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-11-25,3,"I think the three stars are fair, which is coincidentally what is on the general rating, i'm typing here with my daughters as we are sitting at the actual restaurant, so far things have been fine except the service is a little slow and since we are here with two kids I wonder why the waiter didn't offer us the kids menu?
The coffe arrived cold .
The food is taking very long and the place is not crowded and on top of all I see the waiter drying silverware while my soup is sitting at the window getting cold I think he's clueless
Overall experience was  poor and the food was good in flavor but everything arrived Cold  bottom line
The manager give us half off the total bill
I will be willing to give it a second chance but please hire competent help this young idiots that work as waiters and waitresses don't know shit about waiting tables"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-11-23,3,Don't have too much to say other than the breads are great and the sandwich I got was just right.  Good price to value ratio for New York.  Liked it and will be back.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-11-10,4,This was an okay place to meet   Most of the tables are curtained off with waiter services and only a few tables near the cash register are available for first come first service basis.   A small coffee and a chocolate croissant set me back for $6.5 - about right    This is a refreshing break from your run-of-the-mill Starbucks.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-11-05,3,"Every time I go to a Le Pain it's an inconsistent experience. We arrived around 5pm and went to the communal table. Today, the table was covered in plates and trash that had not been cleared yet. Finally a manager (I think) cleared them. Took a while for a waiter to come to us but it wasn't his fault. He was the only waiter managing the whole section. 

We ordered 2 salads. I had the Chicken Cobb salad and asked for dressing on the side. It came dressed because the kitchen ""made a mistake"". Ok no big deal. However my salad was also missing the avocado, cheese, and bread it was supposed to come with. 

So bizarre. Probably won't come back here again."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-10-22,5,"Great atmosphere!  My Quiche Lorraine was fantastic and the petit dejeuner basket was also delicious and we even got some of the spreads and pastries to go!!! The manager, Mario, was very pleasant and professional!! For a first time visitor it was a great experience!"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-10-14,4,Oatmeal is great. Sitting upstairs is great for an efficient business meeting. Coffee isn't great.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-10-09,1,"Service was absolutely terrible, food was avg at best with small servings and couldn't even serve hot coffee - will never be back"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-08-11,4,"They have great selection of soup, salads, sandwiches as well as fresh smoothies.
We were a group of 5 and ordered different dishes, waffle, Cobb salad, tuna sandwich, chicken sandwich, and 2 types of their smoothies; everything tastes great; I noticed most of their items on the menu were organic; 
Customer service is average and it's not that fancy cafe also but overall great experience.
I will not rate them as 5 stars just because of the customer service, cleanliness of the restaurant, compared to similar Cafe/bakeries in New York."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-07-28,1,"HORRIBLE SERVICE. The table was dirty. The waitress took forever to offer me water or anything to drink. Then when I did ask for water, she stood around and took forever to bring this to me. She was incredibly rude. When she brought me my salad, it was DRENCHED in some creamy dressing and further drenched in olive oil. And she didn't even offer me bread. If I wanted an unhealthy salad, I would have gone to Applebee's. I had two bites of my dressing drenched salad, wasted twenty dollars and left. Don't go here, at least not this Le Pain location. DISGUSTING FOOD AND AWFUL WAITRESS."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-07-23,4,"The service was pretty bad, the coffee was luke warm.  Tomato frittata with avocado was very good.  We had to ask for a second place setting and waters!  I'd find a table on the first floor, the second floor is nothing special."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-07-10,1,Great looking venue let down by Staff who  are certainly not interested in serving the customers who pay their wages.  In fact I left with the impression that my asking to be served was a great inconvenience to them.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-05-30,5,"This LPQ location between Fifth and Madison got a first floor update to accommodate more ""cafe"" visitors (non-table-service), complete with cozy leather chairs. You can still dine-in with the table service communal tables in both first and second floors. It's a rare find nestled within the hustle bustle of Fifth Ave shopping."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-05-17,5,"Perhaps their service has gotten bettwr within the last month or so. I came in for an avocado toast and got so much more than I bargained for. My waitress was wonderful, I could tell she was the only one on the floor but she handled her tables with grace. Never forgot I was there alone amongst the couples and families towering over me. While I waited for my food the chef seemed so lively and happy to be making my food. Perhaps he had been a tepan chef before, some of his tricks were quite amusing. Although this is a chain reataurant, it is wholesome to experience someone put your food together with such passion. I knew my meal was going to be fantastic, and it was. I went to another LPQ later that week really desiring another avocado toast for the palate. They surely dissapointed. I will only go to the LPQ on 53rd, they have yet to dissapoint. Service is fast and quality meals. Happy faces, bright smiles shining out of the kitchen and I wouldnt want to dine where I couldnt experience this wonder. Thank you LPQ for making my expensive avocado toast worth every dollar."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-05-07,2,"Horrible service.  Took forever to get food, check, water, waiters attention.  Otherwise a regular lpq, good bread/sandwiches and great Cafe au lait (unfortunately I had the small rather than the big one for 50c more - I blame the waiter for not asking size)"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-04-16,4,"Excellent place to take a break while walking Fifth Avenue.  Upstairs sitdown dining a lot busier than downstairs take out. No waiting for a seat at the communal table- works for single travelers. Farmers lunch is a pretty good deal at $14.95: bowl of chili,  avocado toast and kale salad."
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-04-12,1,"The food is gross, don't come here! I bought a croissant with ham and cheese and when I asked if they could warm it up, the cashier said they do not have a microwave. Like what??? Also i got a small chai tea latte. My total? $11! So expensive! On top of that the taste of both was not good at all! Don't let the decor fool you! Worst chai latte I've ever tasted"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-04-12,4,"I go to this pain quotidien often and the food is consistently good and service is decent, no complaints. The avocado toast and chicken curry sandwich are excellent"
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-04-08,4,Everything was okay .. Customer service good .. One thing that I didn't like  was the location of the restrooms .. In the middle of the tables ( no good )
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-04-01,1,This place deserves zero stars but that is not an option in Yelp. Poor in every way. Keep in mind I try to give everyone a chance but this is ridiculous. How could this establishment still be in business. Unreal. This company need to evaluate their model for running a restaurant.
133,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-145,2016-03-30,2,"Pretty much your standard LPQ set up and menu, but as Brianna F said - VERY SLOW SERVICE! You walk to the upstairs, where seated service is, and no one will come tell you you can sit anywhere, etc.  That eats up over 5 minutes. 

Then you sit down and no one comes to take your order for say 10 minutes. 

Then you wait for an age for your food, and you spy it sitting at the pass through window, and yet no one is around to bring it to you - that was probably around 15 minutes.

At this point I've spent HALF AN HOUR of waiting for what is pretty much a soft boiled egg, smoke salmon, a dollop of cottage cheese, and cold bread - HOW IS THAT SO HARD?

NEVER AGAIN.  This is midtown manhattan people - we don't have time to waste on this unnecessary waiting, whether we be tourists or residents. 

Servers just seem to disappear into the kitchen area, or are somehow engrossed in some kind of busy work (filling ketchup bottles or something) and not paying attention to customers."
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2020-03-07,3,"This DD is a little on the small side but still offers up the same edibles.  It was located near the apartment we rented, therefore, we came in several times during our visit.  Each time we got competent service.  Our orders were correct and came out quickly.  The employees were somewhat friendly.  The shop looked clean.  I'm thankful it was close by."
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2019-08-11,4,"Since This Dunkin Donuts opened on 1st Ave  and 51st  street it has been my go to place in the morning before work or my Sunday take all my time hangout in the morning . After 9am it starts to get crowded in this small place and the only seating is the side counter area by the left wall area . What I like about this location is that they have full selection of donuts and bagels INCLUDING the typical beverages and other food options and a big plus is they have more then 4 folks working here so if you order a veggie egg white on a plain bagel you will not wait that long .On any Sunday morning I always see  the double parked taxis line up as their owners run in to grab some coffee and a donut , etc .If the place was spacious with a few tables I bet it would be a hangout for plenty of folks just like the Starbucks a block up across the street . Whatever , this Double D serves a purpose for the locals and non locals and they are in a really good location and it helps that the donuts and bagels are fresh tasting most of the time ."
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2019-03-18,2,Ok so this Dunkin donuts is good food wise but today the incompetence of this one employee is unreal today I ordered the Cinnamon which is always good and will keep me coming back but this brain less employee tried to hand me the Cinnamon buns with no bag to carry them and said some stupid remark after handing it to me
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2018-12-15,1,"One of the WORST DD I have been to!! Very cheap, more of a hangout for the staff! We bought $14 dollars worth of food and were charged $1 for hot water for my infant!! The Indian/Bengali staff were fighting/shouting and yelling with someone on the phone!!
I would not EVER come here again, even if I have to walk for another mile!!"
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2018-01-20,3,"Quick service but the last 2 of the 3 times I was there they got the order wrong. Is a small decaf latte with vanilla flavor so difficult to remember? 
Taste your order before you leave.!"
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2017-12-28,5,This is the best Dunkin Donuts location I have ever been to. Friendly staff and the place is clean.
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2017-12-15,5,Friendly staff. Always nice. Fast. Go there almost every day on my way to work. Manika is always so sweet in the mornings.
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2017-10-26,4,"Same as most dunkin donuts, the staff is very friendly and quick. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I ordered a dunkin energy drink and got charged 5.01.....but when I go to the dunkin donuts on Lexington near the 6 train which isn't that far at all, they charge me 4.67 for it. I'm not sure why there is a price difference but the food and donuts are usually worth it from here. It's always clean and refreshing"
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2017-04-08,4,"This Dunkin' was recently renovated and is often less crowded than nearby DDs. The service is fast. A large opaque divider separates the entranceway and counter; it allows for a nice flow to the service. Large chairs and a marble bench are available, so you can sit at off to the side, like at a library. Though ""off the beaten path,"" this location is still worth visiting."
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2016-12-05,5,BEST DUNKIN EVER!!!! Manika ( I think that's how you spell it ) is an angel. She is so sweet and really makes you feel welcomed there. My order is always quick and correct. I go every morning. Best DD!
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2016-07-26,4,"There's not really much to say because this is a Dunkin Donuts after all, but it's the best Dunkin I've ever been to. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive and the service is quick. Even on the few occasions where there is a line, it moves fast and the orders remain accurate, which I can not say about many other Dunkin locations in the city. 

It is clear that the franchisee here really cares about his/her restaurant and their customers."
134,dunkin-new-york-19,2016-05-17,5,"My favorite Dunkin!  Staff are very friendly - they always make me smile in the morning.  Dunkin Donuts' are not always consistent, but this location is great."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2020-03-12,3,It's a decent option to grab lunch in the MetLife building but the lines can get long and the cashiers are slow. Sandwiches are around $10 which is pricey but they are pretty large. The chicken Caesar wrap is my go to but the turkey Brie is a solid option as well as it comes on an olive baguette.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2020-02-19,1,Not impressed. The food was terrible and the service was mediocre. I will leave it at that! Will not go back again
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2019-11-07,2,"The food is mediocre at best but there is not that much to choose from in this area.  
What gets me is that MTA workers get 15% discount but this is not offered to anyone else.  There salaries are already inflated with ridiculous benefits including a free metrocard and they are entitled to a discount here.  This is nuts!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2019-10-29,1,"Great food, terrible customer service: I don't usually get anything there because it's a bit too pricey for me but I was running late and was just going to suck it up. I hemmed and hawed over the $9.45 sandwiches that had next to nothing in them or the $9.45 salad. I finally decided on the salad and went to the register. This was not the lunch rush; it was 2:45 pm with just few people in the store. I smiled and said hello to the cashier. She totally ignored me. OK fine. She rang me up, never looked at me, I said thank you (which SHE is supposed to say) and not only ignored me but had a look of utter disdain on her face. I was dirt. I am not going back. 
PS - The salad was delicious and it would have been a nice treat once a week, even at that price but NOPE. I'm not going to be treated that way."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2019-09-24,1,Absolutely horrible service staff.  Came there yesterday to get coffee and the two female service staff was busy talking rather then ringing up the register.  Today they were both speaking profanity in Spanish and cursing customers.  They really need to be educated in good customer service.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2019-07-31,1,Disappointingly stale almond croissant from Cucina & Co. this morning.  Clearly a leftover from a day or two before.  There are a lot of alternatives in Grand Central.  You just lost my business.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2019-04-07,4,"My wife  grabbed dinner before catching our train home. We were pleasantly surprised by the flavors of the meals we ordered! We had their pre fixe selection. Nothing fancy, but each bite was a delight! I had the pan-seared salmon: delicious and the layer of crispiness was just right. The Zarzuela (fish stew) was very well-balanced. Flavor was just right! If you're looking for bold flavors, this may not be the place for you. Desserts (chocolate mousse cake and strawberry shortcake) were generous slices. I'd definitely grab another easy dinner her again, no doubt!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2019-03-15,1,"Pricing here is terrible. They wanted to charge me 12.41 for scrambled eggs and bacon. I understand that it is weighed but nothing at the breakfast bar is worth $12 a pound.

They need to fix the pricing. The register item she was charging me for was clam seafood"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2018-09-21,4,"The hot entre are delicious food quality was never an issue but the one individual serving it was, he has now been reassigned I hope, I  no longer have any issues with this place."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2018-08-09,1,I went to eat here with a friend and the waitress was a nightmare she was so rude to us kept rushing us and the place was empty.  She kept interrupting us and asking us questions about what else we want to order we had the Asian chop chop salad which was horrible.  So upset that I had to write something about my experience on this place.  Will never go back.  Get a better service staff with class please.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2018-06-19,1,"Take out is horrible, food quality seems to vary time to time. Paella is acceptable the first time with very little seafood, the second time was unpleasant. With only one shrimp, two overly dried tiny mussels and one calm, while the person before me got two shrimps, six mussels and four clams, then the rice tasted horrible why did they even add okra into the rice it turned out to be mushy, slimy and not tasty at all.

There is no consistency in quality and serving. Co-worker got a salad with few slices of beef and greens about half a pound was charged $19.00. why bother when you have plenty of tasty one large or two filling lunch options out there."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2018-05-10,4,"This place makes the most delicious fresh muffins. I stop by in the morning around 8am once in a while and their muffins are still warm. It's none of that plastic wrapped stuff that's been shipped and sitting there all week. 

Each muffin is $2.95 which is okay but they are huge. I tried the banana walnut and raisin bran. Both were moist, starchy and not crumbly or overly sweet. The best part is they're not greasy like other places so I don't feel gross after devouring one. 

I can't speak for their other food but I'm definitely returning."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2018-03-22,1,Nothing special going on here. The hot food bar has limited options and it doesn't look fresh and they are really overpriced for what you are getting. Not a fan at all.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2018-03-16,4,"I come here with my aunt. The location is central to us and makes meeting easy. The restaurant is located in the MetLife building but has direct connection to Grand Central Station. 

As you walk in you enter a restaurant that has a warm feeling. The colors are not to bright but also not dull. There is bench seating near the near or regular tables all around. 

The staff here is super friendly and the prices are average for the location. I never feel rushed when we eat here or as we chat after a meal. 

The service is friendly and fast. The food is a short menu but can satisfy most. I have had the roasted chicken, salmon salad, and some other delicious dishes. 

They al have wine and deserts. Two things I generally I don't have but are delicious here. So that's about it a warm friendly place to sit, eat, and talk. Low noise levels."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-12-26,2,"Been here before inquired about the $7.50 roasted chicken special, was charged $8.95. Not the price advertised. Every cent counts & I asked whats included for the 7 50 I was still over charged & paid more. Wonder where those couple of dollars went to"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-11-10,1,"Never buy ""Paella"". It tastes like medicine. These people don't use saffron, which is the correct spice to add to the plate and gives the rice the correct flavor. They just make it middle east (or wherever) style. Paella is from Spain!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-10-20,4,"Located in the MetLife building above Grand Central Station, this was a nice little place to grab breakfast.  I had a smoked salmon & cream cheese omelet and it was perfect.  Coffee was okay, but then again, I'm a little picky.  Also included were 2 slices of multigrain toast and a Swiss potato cake that was really delicious!  Attached to the restaurant is a little market where they sell fresh muffins, pastries, brownies, cookies, lunch salads, soups, sandwiches, chocolates, and some novelty items."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-10-11,5,This is the single best place for breakfast in New York.  Food is amazing. Prices are so reasonable. People are crazy not to know about this.  I can't speak to takeout but the restaurant section is spectacular.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-08-18,4,"I get an egg and cheese wrap and a tumeric lemonade every AM. Yeah, specific, I know.  Regarding the wrap, they serve only 1 half per order, so be prepared. Having said that, they dont skimp on the eggs...speaking of eggs...what do they do to their eggs? Best scrambled eggs i have had! Although I work in the MetLife building, and the convenience is obvious, I'd honestly make a stop here if I worked outside...That wrap sustains me for the day!! 

Only negatives: $$$$$.  The half wrap and small homemade lemonade costs me $8.11. I rationalize this because the quality is there, on both accounts. And, i dont buy my lunch, so it doesnt hurt as much. 

Their self-serve bar is hella pricey, too. Be careful! 

It took me about 5 visits to get the guys at the counter to warm up to me. They are generally not friendly. Guess I passed the ""regular test?""

There's literally 2 checkout ladies that are 'nice'. The rest are miserable and it shows. They seem to be getting a bit better, though ( today, I was actually greeted with a ""hi""!!!)"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-08-03,1,"Absolutely disgusting. Asked for an egg and cheese on a bagel. Woman didn't understand me and gave me whatever she grabbed, which ended up being a hard roll with 2 fried eggs that you could tell they reheated and no cheese. It was hardly even edible. The eggs were greenish and the bread was hard as a rock. I don't know how they can serve that to people! Never again."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-05-18,4,If don't look you can easily miss this restaurant tucked in the lobby of the Metlife Building. They serve a awesome prix fixed meal of either $19.50 for one person or $35 for two. I did the $35 for two and each person splits the main course. The main is big enough for two people. The meal was delicious and had a home cooked feel to it. The steak was delicious and french fries crisp. The veggies were cooked perfectly. The risotto was nice and creamy and had plenty of crab. Desert was also delicious. Great price for a dinner for two
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-04-21,3,"Got a tuna nicoise salad. It came with 3 stick of gum sized pieces of tuna for $15.50. Way overpriced and not that good. Also came with potatoes and not white beans like the menu said.

Rolls that came with the meal were at least delish.

My friend got the chicken pasta special, also for $15.50 and a laughably small portion.

Don't waste your money."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-04-04,3,"I have been coming here for years, first from Westchester and now that I live in Manhattan I sometimes meet friends here. Last week lunch was disappointing. The asian chop chop salad did not seem fresh and was not very tasty. It was too watery too. I have had calamari which was good and the desserts as well.
The worst part was the bad attitude of the waiter. He rushed us for no reason (or maybe he wanted to leave) and tried several times to take away our plates when we were not done yet."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-03-24,1,I got lunch combo today chicken and green string beans. Got sick in my stomach after it. In addition to this this place is very expensive.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-03-23,1,"I echo a lot of the complaints about the customer service. Every single person working in this store is nasty and can't even smile or say hello/thank you. And they are way overpriced - $4.50 for 3 strawberries (because they weigh it), $4.75 for oatmeal. Go across the street and you get oatmeal with fruit for $2.75. Several coworkers stopped going here because of the terrible attitudes and overpriced food, and I have done the same. I hate this place."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-03-07,1,I ordered potatoes and salmon the food was delicious but the person serving it customer service was horrible. I called and spoke to the manager as soon as I got to work no more than 5 min after because I couldn't get over the encounter I had with the man serving the hot food. If you pay for your food you should be treated with some sort of decency and be able to choose what you want without feeling rushed. It's apparent he chooses what to give you and how much of it because the customer before me had the same meal except the man gave him more of it. Absolutely terrible customer service but the manger I spoke to said he will talk to him so good luck!
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-02-15,3,"Your usual office-area cafe type area that has everything and specializes in nothing, but at least with smiles from two separate staffers, a rarity in this field."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-01-30,4,"I used to come here all the time when I worked in the MetLife building. Of course, having said I came here all the time means that the food was pretty good (and it was also convenient). I have never eaten in the restaurant, I just came for the grab-and-go options for breakfast and lunch. At 8:30am you can get a chocolate chip muffin that's still hot from the oven, yum! And they have some pretty good lunch options, both hot food and a salad bar. It is kind of pricey, the lunch I didn't mind that much but the hot breakfast was wayyyy too expensive. I think I paid around $8 for some bacon and homefries! But I didn't know what the price would be until I was at the register and didn't want to be a freak and say I didn't want it anymore. But damn. So that's why from that day on I only got muffins for breakfast which I think were in the $2 range."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2017-01-02,1,"I was very disappointed in the food today (11/25/16 3:15pm). I went to the take out area and saw a beautifully seafood paella. But the old guy gave me mostly rice. They lured me in with the amount of shrimp and other seafood that shows in the display -- but boy did they give me a pile of rice instead. Disgraceful for $11 with tax.

--

Given that manager asked me to contact her, I sent her an email that I'm not sure what else I could say. She didn't reply to my Yelp message weeks ago nor offer to send a credit. Poor service and similar half-hearted follow-up.  Still waiting for some kind of effort or credit to try to make it right. But that has to happened for almost a year now.

-- 

T T: Thank you Marlies. I am not sure what I would add to the conversation. Your customer-facing staff greatly disappointed. What else can I tell you? Honestly. One shrimp. One mussel. And yes, one baby clam. Doesn't that say it all?"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2016-11-28,1,"The worst dining experience ever!  I came back to the place and took my visiting family from Saudi to enjoy the experience I had the first time me and my wife, but instead, we were greeted by a Filipino Looking waiter/Hostess with the most annoying unpleasant unwelcome face ever!!! How could anyone eat or dine in a place like that?"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2016-11-02,3,"I come here for breakfast daily after a long commute out of convenience and the food is definitely very good. they have bagels,  farina and oatmeal and fresh eggs bacon, etc.. all very fresh and tasty. a little pricy so be careful with food that has to be weighed. I have never gone for lunch. the reason I give the 3 stars is because some of the checkout girls are just SO RUDE.. sometimes I say I wont go back but its convenient so I go. I just wish their staff would get training on being courteous. I have co workers that have banned the place. After all, theres a lot of places to eat in the area but this works for me so I go."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2016-10-17,2,"Gave them another try today after gym and, oh man, huge mistake. I pretty much paid $10 for rice and green beens. Should've done my usual: the food place inside Equinox right next building where I get a burrito bow with super reasonable protein portion for less than $9.
Only gave them a 2 stars because the food is actually well made. 
Customer service? Non-existent."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2016-09-27,4,"I've been coming here for the last 7 years. Yes, I'm a creature of habit but mostly it's because I'm a busy executive with no time to stroll around looking for a place to eat.

Cucina never disappoints me, their food is tasty and always fresh.  My go-to dish is either the hot salmon with rice and a side vegetable (they switch it up everyday) or the salad bar which has a variety of delicious options.  My only complaint is that almost everything they cook is heavily dressed in olive oil but I guess that's to be expected from an Italian restaurant, lol....Oh and they are pricey compared to other locations but your paying for location and convenience.

They do discount their food after 3:30pm which is cool for someone like myself who picks up dinner on the way home.

If you have time, they have a sit down restaurant right next door."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2016-07-06,1,"Before I say anything I just want to say that I am an 18 year old unpaid intern who is spending time over the summer learning real life skills before I ship off to college this fall and have to pay $60,000+ per year in tuition fees. Suffice to say that i'm on a bit of a budget. The first time I went it was fine, service was good and the food was good too. The second time I went not so much. I bought a small clamshell of fruit and cottage cheese. Now I don't think that fruit and cottage cheese should be that much should it? I was wrong. It was $17 for what amounted to about two cups of food in total. And if they are going to justify themselves by saying that you pay for convenience then they should at least advertise their prices so I don't have to be stuck at the register being forced to pay for overpriced garbage. On top of that the fruit wasn't ripe, it was like biting into a rock. I will never be coming here again and I suggest that anyone on a budget or anyone who wants ripe fruit shouldn't come either."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2016-06-23,4,"I went back to cucina at MetLife  for lunch ..It is such a great place to meet for quick business lunch  right  in the  middle of Grand Central.
As recommended by our server as the best and  most requested salad here with variation of Asian flare with shrimp and ginger-sesame dressing(I:ll leave this one for the next time) I ordered chicken Chop Chop salad and my guest got black Angus steak simply served with  crispy French fries. Such a wonderful
Recommendation,good service. I will come back for more."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2016-03-24,5,"I have been a patron at Cucina & Company for 15 years now. I used to work in this building as well and am now a regular there for business meetings. For over a decade, I have been taken care of by a wonderful hostess named Cherine. While I could focus on the array of fare at Cucina, I feel it would serve a greater purpose to recognize customer service and care at its finest. Cherine always goes out of her way to know her patrons and always knows where to seat the guests, including myself, based on our needs in a business- friendly environment. It is always a pleasure to see someone really take the time to know their guests, which is one reason I always look forward to my next visit."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2016-02-14,5,"Now going on 7 years visiting the restaurant. Still the same.  Service is superb,  Food is consistently yummy, no matter which dish we order.  Cannot beat this for the money or the quality of the food and service."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2016-01-20,1,"I just had the absolute worst experience at this excuse for a food establishment. There's a sign for breakfast sandwiches and in front of it different carb options. Naturally I assume I can order a breakfast sandwich with my choice of carb. I ask for a ham egg and cheese on a croissant. The man hands me a container of scrambled eggs. I say a ham egg and cheese on a croissant sandwich. He asks toasted? I say yes. He come back with a ham and cheese in a croissant. I ask where the egg is? And he says he cannot put an egg on it if it's on a croissant. Then why didn't he tell me that originally??? That's fraudulent. I tell him that so he gives me a side container with a mini scoop of eggs to put on the sandwich myself. I get to the checkout register where I'm simultaneously yelled at and assaulted by two women (who are both working one register) trying to charge me an extra $3.70 for the half scoop of eggs. They keep saying that it doesn't come with the croissant sandwich. I keep trying to explain that while I understand that. The man behind the counter didn't tell me before making my sandwich and so gave it on the side. They just keep repeating the same thing. Then they call over the manager who starts to explain that croissants can't come with eggs at which point I just say keep the eggs, pay for the sandwich and leave. Two blocks away in feeling so bad about this and my nasty ham sandwich (I mostly wanted an egg and cheese sandwich with ham. NOT a ham and cheese for breakfast) that I walked all the way back and gave the back the sandwich. Didn't ask for my money back. Just wanted nothing to do with that sandwich and to let the awful folk who work there know what terrible people they are. And just how miserable this establishment is."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2016-01-11,1,"Every single time I walk past this place, the hostess, who's a thick White woman has the nastiest, unwelcoming look on her face. I am a brown-skin African American/Hispanic, and it seems like she doesn't care for my color. I also went into the take-out part of the restaurant today, and the server, who by the way was an older tall White guy acted like he didn't  want to serve me. Their food is ok, but fuck the food, the attitudes in that place fucking suck. Don't think I'll patronize again, nor will I book breakfast and lunch meetings for my guys at work anymore. #anticucinametlifebuilding"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-12-29,1,The food is horrible and the service sucks! I have been several times to cucina and the last time I ordered a simple sesame bagel with butter and they gave me a burnt bagel DRENCHED in butter (a heart attack waiting to happen!) I went back and requested a new bagel and believe me it will be the last time I go to get breakfast or any food from this place!
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-11-20,1,You have to order as much as they feel enough for them to made money.. Or they will come to you to tell to order more. I was in there 12:30 and half of table were open. I order coffee and desert because I saw it in the linch menu. But they came to me twice to say I have to order more because it is lunch time.  So I left before serving any. I do not recommend this cafe.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-11-13,4,Bakery portion of this is very good. Dining area ok too. Great dinner special if you need something reasonably priced for two. Not gourmet but good.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-10-15,3,"the food is decent, the three stars is because it's SO pricey. You could get a small container of salad, salmon, chicken salad, vegetables...and the scale always reads $8.50+ no matter the amount. i always go here for a quick lunch - they have really good corn soup, hot foods, bagels...would recommend if you want something quick to take for lunch back to the office or the train (and you don't care about price)."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-09-30,4,"Many years ago, I worked in this building. Coming back to this place brings back a flurry of memories. This place sells some of the most delicious cookies and muffins around! Cookies like the macadamia nut cookie and peanut butter cookie melt in your mouth! I love the smell of this store. The aroma reminds me of walking into an Italian bakery. 

During the holidays, Cucina sells original holiday cookies and culinary delights. 

I find the staff members accommodating and warm. They are more than willing to answer your questions. 

People find the location convenient to pick up some coffee before heading to work. Close to Amtrak, and the MTA, and located in the MetLife building this place serves as a focal point for people to meet. 

I love this place even though the price can be steep. Come and stop by. Rest and enjoy the food in the near by cafe."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-09-15,4,"Have had breakfast here several times.  Just fine but busy and noisy.

Today had lunch and the food was very good, wait staff was very nice, price was very reasonable and it was not as crowded as at breakfast.  It will be a regular lunch meeting place for me now."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-08-27,4,"Hot, fresh, and straight out of the oven morning baked goods served everyday! That's enough to win my business and my heart.

Cucina is where I satisfy my morning cravings for sweet pastries like an almond or chocolate croissant, muffins, scones, cheesecake brownies, and pound cakes. Top notch quality and tasty. I love that my pastries are still burning hot when I pick them up! Now, let's not forget the white chocolate macadamia cookie for the afternoon neither! Baked goods are fresh and so delicious. To go with my sweets, I would always get a large coffee. Coffee blends and flavors change everyday but repeats on the same day every week. I am not a big fan but variety is great. 

Cucina also does a great job catering for office breakfast or lunch parties. Not only do they are prompt in delivering orders but they make sure they supply the sugar, cream/milk, and stirring sticks for coffee. Extra plates and napkins for the food. Excellent service!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-08-20,4,Decent amount of food for the price. Not a lot of diversity in this area so Cucina really delivers. This rating is only for the take out place as I've never had an experience in the dining room.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-05-20,3,"Outrageous prices. Decent food but very convenient. If you get a salad in the morning, before 10:00 am, note that it was probably made the day before. The soups are always good and the staff is very friendly."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-04-25,4,"Reasonably priced for the area. Had their avocado and Sprouts sandwich which was surprisingly filling.  Sure, it was something I could whip up at home. But it's perfect for those days when you don't have time to pack lunch and want something healthy. Their other food looked pretty good and a coworker gave her thumbs up approval on their pizza."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-04-17,2,"This place just gets worse and worse.  I don't know why, but I just tried their turkey ""health wrap.""  I spooned 5 spoons of mayo off that thing (which apparently was ""dressing"").  The rest of the wrap is full of middling turkey, hard boiled egg and horrible iceberg lettuce.  I saw no sign of the spinach  that was supposed to be on there.  Once again - if you want to pay a lot for what amounts to a gas station sandwich, this is the place. I implore you to go just about anywhere else in a one block radius for a better, cheaper sandwich."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-02-17,1,"I've possibly never encountered a worse attitude to customers from staff than I experienced today at this restaurant. Treated extremely badly first by the waitress and then hectored by the hostess, who really should know better. This during a business meeting. Both myself and my client were dumbstruck. Sadly I think this place has a captive audience, or I doubt it would still be trading."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-01-29,5,Amazing Chicken Parmigiana.  Great place for a sit down work lunch.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2015-01-28,5,"One of my go to choices for lunch, whether alone or with colleagues.  Food is terrific, staff is friendly and helpful. A great spot for lunch or dinner."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2014-11-17,2,"Pastries are good.  Coffee is OK (in the pot).  Sevice, not good.
Last time I was there, there was a person in front me at the cashier.  And there was the empty one next to it.  So I asked ""are you open?""  She looked at me and did not even give me an answer.  It has been so long since I got this old New York attitude.  Wake up, the 80s is over!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2014-11-17,4,"Cucina Chop Chop salad!!!! ***** yummmmm rice pudding.. just as good...

Food is great... 

Service can be improved! 

but its a good place!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2014-10-09,3,Good oatmeal. A little packed in the am. Like the lunchtime chopped salad with cabbage and chicken.  It is too expensive though.  I like the dijon mustard chicken on the cold buffet table. Cashiers are nice and fast.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2014-08-08,5,Fantastic place for to-go breakfast from the restaurant area. Incredibly kind and thoughtful waitstaff. Cherinne and the crew are wonderful people with great memories (we stopped having to formally order after a few days). This is a definite go-to place for breakfast! Smoked salmon bagel is the best.
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2014-07-22,3,"We Stop in occasionally for a quick, low-key dinner. Unpretentious place offering prix fixe menu at $35 for 2 people having same entree ($19.50 for one) includes app, main, sides and dessert, several choices of each. Simple, competently prepared food and so-so wine choices. Good for those nights that you can't be bothered cooking and don't want a big ""scene"" restaurant.  OK Mediterranean-ish decor. Friendly service. All in all, won't win any prizes, but not bad either.  Good weeknight alternative for the tired and hungry."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2014-07-13,3,"Disappointed by the bacon egg and cheese! Way too much egg and not enough tasty cheese. The bread is average too.
But the other pastries seem good even if i haven't tasted it. I should give it a chance to order one another day."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2014-06-27,3,"I purchased a beautiful 10-inch cake for my co-workers birthday from the restaurant. Since this was not my first time, I knew the quality of the desserts was exceptional, but when I returned to my office I quickly realized the cake looked smaller than my prior purchase. I quickly called the restaurant and the manager insisted it was a 10-inch cake but that was totally false considering the box the cake was packaged in was 10 by 10 and the cake was smaller than the box. The cake only measured 9-inch diameter, the taste of the cake was delicious but I wish I was told upfront about the change in cake dimensions."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2014-05-09,4,"For quick ""grab-n-go"" breakfast, the cranberry muffin is terrific.  Most mornings, they're still warm from the oven.  Also, best unsweetened ice tea I've ever had.  Breakfast and take out lunch buffet is a bit pricey, however.  

At lunch, Cucina Cafe next door has become one of my favorite lunch spots in midtown -- fast, good menu selections, high energy.  The hostess is very friendly, the service is just OK because there's such an ""in-and-out"" feel to the place.  The prices here are reasonable.  A nice simple menu with a few daily specials hits the mark as far as providing diverse selection of food.  I almost hate to reveal this secret but their Steak Frites, in my opinion, is one of the best bargains in NYC.  I have such a big mouth!  Darn it!!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2014-02-05,5,"This place is awesome !!Came here to buy a blueberry muffin and a cup of coffee in the morning today and saw that they serve dinner at their cafe next door, the nice lady showed me their dinner menu and and deals they are offering so I decided to come back again to try their dinner.
The blueberry muffin is full of blueberries, so many that my mouth turned blue, I love it! Their coffee is very tasty as well and cheaper than Starbucks.
Dinner is great, $35 for two salad one huge entree and two desserts. Service here is superb, the pretty young lady was very helpful and smiles a lot, she is also very generous with the wine I ordered. I wish I had known about this place sooner. I would come again and again."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2014-01-09,3,"Quick and courteous service, and small-moderately sized entrees. The atmosphere is clean and bright. The chocolate creme brulee was terrible. It had a brownie like consistency and the torched sugar on top was gelatinous, rather than lightly crunchy."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2013-12-28,4,"I stop in almost every morning for coffee and sometimes breakfast. The coffee is great - people always tell me it smells really good when I get to the office (mostly when I get Hazelnut). Their bagels are also pretty good and the fruit bar is always super fresh. It's a little pricey but worth it for fast, quality eats."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2013-11-01,1,"This place is so overpriced for mediocre food.  .4 lbs of food (scrambled eggs, 3 pieces of bacon and 2 pieces of potato) is $5. The scrambled eggs are mushy and grainy at the same time, the bacon is bacon (when is bacon ever bad) and the potatoes are usually undercooked or overcooked.

Lines move pretty quickly but be careful when asking for anything extra.  I've gotten a bagel here before and noticed that there was barely any butter on it so I asked if I could get some butter.  The cashier questioned why I would want butter for my bagel if I already ordered a bagel with butter.  GOOD QUESTION!  I've seen the manager get called for a lady who wanted a few mayonnaise packets although she had bought soup.

Considering how expensive this place is for OK food, I'd think that they could be a little bit more generous with their condiments, or actually be normal.

I only go here when I have to.  The salad bar is good-- nothing amazing.

Just go to Nissi or Bread & Butter on 44th a block west if you want better deli food for less money and condiment hoarding."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2013-10-11,1,"Hated the atmosphere. Staff wasn't particularly friendly. No variety on the menu. Breakfast menu didn't have oatmeal, or pancakes, or waffles, or anything besides muffins, bread, and juice. Sat there waiting for a friend and went 30 minutes without water. Jesus."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2013-08-23,2,"Kind of like a school cafeteria for grown-ups.  Different stations specializing in hot foods, desserts, coffee, cold drinks.

I got a ""breakfast burrito"".  It was half of a bacon, egg and cheese wrap, for $5.00.  Honestly it wasn't bad, but since it was half, it was pretty small.  Being a burrito, I expected some salsa at least.......nope.

Way overpriced and just not worth it."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2013-07-18,2,"I do not get it.  The food is okay - absolutely not more than okay - and overpriced.  And there is always a huge line, which is ironic because again, everything is just okay.  Not really sure how anyone working there gets to keep their jobs considering they're pretty unfriendly and unhelpful."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2013-05-15,3,"Lunch deli is consistently overpriced, breakfasts are pretty good.. The working memory of the servers rival Chipotle for a race to the bottom, where you sometimes wonder if they're messing with you or if they really are ""just that high""... I have ordered from here every other morning for a year now and not ONCE has one of their workers EVER been able to remember what I ordered 30 seconds before. This is not an exaggeration, it's the source of my morning entertainment now to keep track of this. Maybe it's like that 1-800 phone call phenomenon where they ask you your SSN # and first/last name 3x just to see if you're still who you were 10 seconds ago... whatever it is, it's infuriating verging on the point of dark humor.

Food's always fast, fresh and convenient, though, so can't hate too much... but you can always rant."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2013-01-23,3,"if i worked in the area, this would be one great lunch spot- fresh food, good quality. nice soups! nice selection of hand snacks as well. it is a bit pricey, but come on, look at where it is located! i could definitely see myself grabbing a quick take home dinner after work, they give generous large portions. desserts look fantastic!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2013-01-15,1,"I order a PB&J bagel. Instead, I get a bagel with two little packets of smuckers PB and no J, which I could have just gotten for free by walking into any Courtyard Marriott during continental breakfast hours. I don't know what kind of shit you fuckers get away with pulling on the poor & unsuspecting MetLife employees, but this shit won't fly with me. See you never."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2012-12-04,3,"REVIEW : BREAKFAST MUFFIN & COFFEE ONLY

I pass by this on my way in and out of office and sometimes I stop by to grab a breakfast bite. Yes, its not the cheapest place to grab a muffin and coffee or a breakfast sandwich and coffee.

However I give them 3 star because of the following reasons, I have tried their various muffins and coffee and they are above average. They get the extra str for the Lemon poppy muffin that they make, don't bother with any of the other muffins as some of them tend to be over sugared / over flavoured.

The Lemon Poppy muffin is simply fantastic, try it and then you will understand what I am talking about. Definitly worh a repeat."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2012-10-10,3,"Service is ""iffy""..., can be great and can be awful!!!  Food is reasonable in restaurant, but wait for the discounts in the afternoon if you takeout.  Otherwise, it is highly overpriced.  C'mon, not everyone passing through MetLife is employed as an attorney upstairs.  Not everyone is NY is employed and we all need a cheap, fast meal.  
SODA REFILLS AT FULL PRICE is not a NY-friendly restaurant thing.  I don't recall being charged for soda refills on my many previous visits.  And $3.50 for a soda is EXCESSIVE!!!!  Especially if you're charging for a REFILL!
Good food at high prices and lousy, nasty attitude in the cafe. WHY ARE YOU NOT OPEN ON WEEKENDS?????  Buy their card for a 10% NECESSARY discount."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2012-03-26,2,Got the chicken salad wrap. It was extremely salty yet surprisingly bland
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2012-03-06,4,"Best Fruit *tart* Cake I have ever had.  And again, I must thank my greatest friend, Xue T. for letting us taste such a fine deliciously fresh fruit tart cake.  It was indeed amazing in every bite!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2012-02-12,4,"THIS REVIEW ONLY RELATES TO THE FRENCH ONION SOUP:

There is absolutely no reason to ever eat at this restaurant unless you work in the metlife building and you're expensing the meal, but the Onion Soup is absolutely incredible. There's got to be at least a pound of gruyere in each deliciously baked soup dish. The soup itself has a great consistency with great mushroom and onion flavor; not too soupy at all. I honestly think it's the best french onion soup I've ever had. The chop chop salad's also really enjoyable and fresh if you're not in the mood for supreme amounts of cheese, sodium, carbs, and savory goodness."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2012-02-03,4,"The only times I go here are early morning  to grab breakfast and coffee. With that said, it's good coffee, quick service and breakfast is usually good. Muffins can be over cooked on occasion but the other pastries are usually consistently good. You can get in and out for breakfast under $5 which for midtown is pretty good."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2012-01-27,4,I have been coming here for years its great food for the price.  If you're in midtown on the east side and looking for some decent Italian food that's inexpensive this is the place to go!! Big fan!!
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2011-12-02,4,"We cater our weekly Wednesday morning continental breakfast from here, and I drop by every now and then for their soup+sandwich special. It's not cheap, but if you want cheap, go to McDonalds. Honestly, pay for the experience and how your meal makes you feel emotionally and physically. Emotionally this place does it for me. Only because they make me look forward to Wednesday mornings. Physically, their food is light and healthy and I don't suffer the pain of poor digestion unlike i would at micky d's."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2011-12-01,3,"Cucina Cafe for breakfast; the food is really good and attractively priced (eggs salmonine $9, breakfast for three just $40). All good. What can make the experience less positive is if you're unlucky enough to get one of the wait-staff who is surly and disinterested, and the are a few - though not all. Hasn't stopped me returning thus far."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2011-10-06,3,"I secretly hate the Grand Central greater area because if you take the wrong exit, you won't FIND anything! *rant over*. So... naturally, be sure to take the MetLife exit (East of the clock in the main concourse if you're getting off the 4567 subway). 

I came here for a weekday work lunch. Not my choice. You can expect this place is BUSY when it comes to work time lunch. But,  fortunately, we have no issues with seating. They only take parties of 6+ or more (I think) for reservations. The menu is varied but this is kind of like a fancy chain cafe.. say Guy and Gallard (which I think is better), or even Au Bon Pain.. after all, we sat in the restaurant part, but there is a bustling cafe too.

I ordered the cucina chop chop.. which was just ok. I just it gave me a toothache for 2 days... because it was more nuts than veggies. There were no leafy greens- just chopped cucumber, diced chicken, peanuts and and the Asian crispy noodles pretty much. Not what I was expecting. I still ate it though, mainly because I was hungry. It wasn't bad though, it just wasn't great. The dressing was pretty decent- it was some kind of thick, lime, ranch type of thing (I could have totally made this up- look it up!) LOL. 

Anyway, my two companions got: 1) the chicken cutlet (milanese) with arugula- there were MORE greens in her dish- and it was a fried chicken dish! Seemed it was good though; it was green atop the chicken.  My other companion had the cucina club sandwich, which I thiiink was turkey, with bacon (?) some cheese and french fries. Standard diner fare.

And that's what Cucina and Co is folks- a fancy diner, with a really nice decor but busy ambiance. 

Prices are high for this kind of joint but that is to be expected in an office building- at Grand Central (tourist central) let alone- salads $12 ish, sandwiches, $12 ish... 

Service was fine- it was fast and cordial. I don't have an inkling to return."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2011-09-21,4,"I'm not sure why, but I have this general distrust of restaurants that lead into office buildings as Cucina & Co. does.  However, it's not a strong distrust as evidenced by the fact that ll it took was me seeing a sign that for less than $20 a head, there was a three course pre-fixe dinner to be had!  

I wanted to try something different than my usual stops on this night, so my girlfriend and I dived in not having read any reviews (unusual for us).  

Cucina & Co. has two sections, a take out deli and a sit down restaurant.  My girlfriend speaks highly of the take out deli, but this would be her first time at the restaurant.  The interior is made to look as warm and inviting as possible with patterned tile on the wall, chalk boards announcing specials of the day and wood panels on some of the walls.  

We were seated quickly by a friendly host and our waitress was there in a flash.   She explained that for the pre-fixe, we could order different appetizers and desserts but that we would be sharing the entree.  Fair enough.  We ordered the chopped salad for our appetizers and the salmon for our entrees.  The desserts were ordered later, but consisted of a chocolate cake and a creme brulee. 

The salad was interesting as it turned out to be more of a slaw, but it didn't taste like cole slaw.  It had a much more mild flavor to it with hints of seasoning.  Nothing exceptional, but not bad either.

The entree was a most impressive sight!  Served on a giant platter was a mound of roasted potatoes, vegetables and several pieces of salmon, more than enough to serve us both (we speculated it could have fed a third person without a problem).  The vegetables were roasted perfectly and the potatoes had a wonderful texture to them.  While they were cooked with rosemary, not a lot of that flavor came through.  I suspect they need to use more of the herb than they did.  The salmon was beautifully crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  Kudos!

For dessert, I had the chocolate creme brulee, which is basically a creme brulee that uses a thick, chocolate cake as its base.  It was very good and different from other creme brulees I've had in my time.  The chocolate flavor worked well with the custard and the top was nicely burnt and crisp.

Most of my stars here are for the entree and dessert as well as the nice atmosphere unexpectedly tucked away inside an office building.  Be warned however, sodas are NOT free refills."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2011-07-18,3,"Being in the Metlife Building and above Grand Central Station automatically makes everything served at Cucina uber-expensive.

Not the normal NYC expensive, but rather a meal for one can sometimes cost the price of a meal for two somewhere else. In the mornings if you're trying to catch a quick breakfast-order before heading to work upstairs, it won't be a quickie. Expect long lines that can sometimes extend past the store's one of two/three exits.

Regardless of what time of day you go, you'll have a wide variety of options to choose from (hot, cold, salads, meals, desserts, drinks, etc). Each day, there's usually a different set of hot meals to choose from, and varied sides.

For breakfast, you can get premade sandwiches (any combo of ham, eggs, and cheese...fruits, or bagels+cream cheese). For lunch, you can expect choices ranging from Tilapia for Fish, to stews and roast garlic chicken for meats. As well as the regular assortment of Salad-Bar options (Fruit-bar for breakfast fans). They also have a wide selection of overpriced beverages too.

If your office needs catering, they have that too (ranging from cookies and cakes, to sandwiches and chips).

On average, you can expect to pay between $7-$10 for Lunch, and around $5 for breakfast (sandwich+drink).

Checkout Tips:

- I'd recommend going in off hours to avoid the loooooooong rush hour lines. In morning, if you can get in there after 9AM or just after 8AM you can get a quick checkout.

- In the afternoon/lunchtime, if you can get in there around 1:30-2:30PM, you can avoid some MAJOR rush hour lines.

- Charge Cards will get you through the lines faster here, and some people fumble a lot with cash and take time getting back change.

In short: The food (if you choose wisely) is good here, but the prices and crowd can quickly dissipate any joys you may have had. That, and the MANY cheaper alternatives around East 42nd street too ;)."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2011-06-02,3,"at the salad bar, grab one piece of salmon, put it on a bed of fresh spinach.   it comes out to  3 dollars.  and its fresh yummy, filling and healthy.   

that is a great deal for grand central.  you cant even get a protein bar and pack of gum for that cheap. 

at the hot bar, get the chicken fingers. yum."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2011-05-22,3,"I haven't done to the to-go food here, but I had a work lunch here recently that was nice and quick.  I had the salmon with ramps and peanut potatoes (I think they are just small?) and the salmon was well-seasoned and cooked, and the sides were tasty.  They were not very prompt with refilling water and soda or with bringing the check, but this is a perfectly fine place to eat for lunch."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2011-05-07,3,good for a quick breakfast. fresh. but a tad loud and cafeteria-esque
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2011-05-05,1,"This place is disgusting!!!! I work in the building and decided to get some eggs and sausage for breakfast.  What a bad idea. The eggs tasted as if they were cooked in chicken broth. They were oily, flavorless and smelled like chicken. The sausage was edible but not good, I ate one of the two because I was hungry.  Besides the disgusting taste, it also costs a fortune. They weigh their eggs, and I got almost a pound of them (obviously no one asked me how many eggs I wanted). On top of all that, when I came back to my desk I found out that the place was recently inspected by the city of NY and got 41 points of violation. This means in simple words that they have mice and roaches amongst other problems.   So to sum up, this was the worst breakfast ever, it been an hour since I tried it and I still want to vomit."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2010-10-18,3,"Great work-lunch spot.  Service is speedy, guaranteeing you are in and out in the hour.

It's inside the grand central.  Look for the direction for the Metlife  building.  

Come early around noon to beat the rush.  
Menu is mix between American and Italian selections.  

Caesar salad - definitely had better elsewhere
Pumpkin soup - warm the soul kind of soup.  got me into the mood for fall.  not overly sweet but I can taste a hint of maple syrup lingering.  

I was in an out and back to the office within the 1hr 15min."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2010-07-24,3,"This review is only for breakfast, and granted I'm not an expert on breakfast (I rarely eat it), but I enjoyed it here.  Usual thing I get here is french toast with bacon.  The bread they use for the french toast is really good and it's very tasty overall.  It is a bit too sugary though, and could also use more cinnamon.  The portion size is decent, especially for a restaurant like this in Grand Central.  The bacon I've got from here is cooked correctly and is decent; it could have more flavor though, which leaving a little more grease on it might help.  A lot of places like in central locations like this suck, but this one doesn't.  I actually don't mind coming here every once in awhile at all.  It isn't the best breakfast I've ever had, but its pretty damn satisfying."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2010-05-28,4,"I am always up for a new place for lunch.  And this happens to be a place that a colleague of mine has been frequenting and telling me about for quite some time.  So today, I opted to get away from the typical delis I venture to, and decided to go with her to the Metlife building to try Cucina.

From the moment you walk in, what I liked the most was the display of the food.  In comparison to other by the pound establishments, Cucina keeps things simple.  Simple labeling, simple display and simply delicious!  I decided to get an assortment of salads (chicken, beef, orzo) and they were all amazingly tasty.

What else you ask?  I MUST go back to try their baked goods.  Cookies, fruit tarts, muffins...anything sweet that will satisfy that craving.

That only means I have another reason to venture across 42nd Street during lunch time next week!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2010-05-27,3,"Located en route from and to Grand Central Station, this suits-dominated Mediterranean eatery makes me want to sing some Sondheim... 

Another hundred people just got off of the train 
And came up through the ground, 
While another hundred people just got off of the bus 
And are looking around 
At another hundred people who got off of the plane 
And are looking at us 
Who got off of the train 
And the plane and the bus 
Maybe yesterday. 

Everyone is in a hurry in Manhattan especially as they pour out from the subways and commuter trains. No time to dawdle. You can get trampled on the way to the Cucina Cafe on the main floor of the MetLife Building where the dining room is filled with suits on their cells. But you can also get a decent omelet, the $9.95 Spinach, Sausage and Mushroom Omelet with too-crispy hash browns and toast (see photo). The no-nonsense vibe of the diners is offset by the pronounced sunniness of the staff. Enough chit-chat. I have to melt into the teeming masses and get to work. 

FOOD - 3 stars...a decent breakfast is to be had in this cucina 
AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...it's all a blur to me, but I seem to recall an Olive Garden-like ambiance but on hyperdrive 
SERVICE - 3.5 stars...sunny despite the cloudiness of white collar workers on their cells

135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2010-03-23,4,"HANDS DOWN BEST STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE IN THE CITY! You must not order just a Small size - size up to a large or you might regret it. I bought this for a birthday party. Ten plates, ten forks and ten slices later - one friend and her fingers and tongue completely wiped the cake board spotless. It is simply light, delicious and very fresh. Small is $18 and large is $25 - perfect for 10-12 people. Order at least a day ahead or bet on your luck to get one before noon same day.

They also have good valued lunch specials. Portions are very generous."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2010-02-06,2,"I never knew how good I had it in Century City until I moved to New York.  Century City is full of inexpensive, pay by the pound cafeterias like Trimana or Mrs. Winston's. I was hopeful when I saw the familiar cold cases and clear plastic containers at Cucina & Co. - but then realized it was $10 a pound!  They don't have much of a selection either: hardboiled eggs, feta cheese, bean, rice, grain and leaf salads, salmon, mustard chicken, and various roasted vegetables like butternut squash, zucchini and carrots - all heavy and full of water.  

If you come here after 3:30pm you can get 25% off your salad bar items.  Eating here, which I will do for convenience, will only make me long for the days in Los Angeles when I could scoop up a heap of vegan turkey salad, french fries, tater tots, fried fish fillets, corn hush puppies, spinach salad blue cheese, bacon bits, cut fruit and stuffed green peppers without having to pay an arm and a leg."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2010-01-28,3,"they messed up my breakfast order!! i specifically ordered a SCRAMBLED egg, bacon, and cheese roll (my FAVE) and he picked up a random sandwich (ended up being a BLAND fried egg and cheese on a stale roll UGH) and gave it to me. i rarely get breakfast and this was a HUGE disappointment for me! what a waste of $4.30. 

only minus one star since i know i'll be back...damn you stomach!! damn you cravings! bah!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2010-01-25,2,"Let's be honest. This place isn't very good. But when its raining, snowing, hot, cold, or you just work at 200 Park this place is just easy.

The breakfast and sandwich options are best. The hot food, you're taking your life in your hands. God speed."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2009-11-03,1,"So, everything was going great. I started my new job, and there was this little spot RIGHT under the escalator to work, such an awesome spot to grab breakfast, lunch, whatever I forgot to bring along with me (foodwise, just foodwise). Yes, it was expensive, but hey, it's midtown, not even midtown but actually inside Grand Central, what did anyone expect?

Oh. Right. For it to NOT have bugs in it. By ""it,"" I refer to my caesar salad. By ""bugs"" I mean the large black one I found inside of ""it."" And promptly brought back downstairs. Now, I understand that sometimes, in food establishments, this happens. And that in those cases, they try to make it up to you. You be the judge of how much ""making it up to me"" was happening here:

Me (holding open salad container, looking rather disgusted): Is there a manager I can speak to?
Cashier (no expression): What's wrong?
Me: Umm, there's a bug in my salad that I just bought here.
Cashier (peers in): Oh. Ya.
Cashier takes salad and throws it away.
Me: shocked silence
Cashier (shrugs): It happens. How much was that?
Me (stammering): Uh, like $7?

She gave me my money back like this was totally normal. I asked when their last inspection was, hoping to at least get a glimmer of a reaction? Nope. Not a chance. This was totes typical, and they were not surprised. Am I coming back? Nope. Not a chance."

135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2009-06-27,2,"Decent spot but probably wouldn't go back as it's like every other overpriced spot within GCT.  I picked up stuff from the salad bar for lunch as there was a decent suggestion, though I'm sure it could get old real fast if you ate there several times a week.  It was a little pricey for a salad bar and would recommend Dishes in the area over this place.  Expect to spend at least $10 on lunch from the salad bar."
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2009-06-24,4,"Instead of wasting time asking oneself how food prices in midtown are justifiable, one can simply bring breakfast and lunch to work to avoid spending what they deem to be unnecessary. But for the rest of us who are too lazy to do so, we accept these unreasonable prices and label them the best damn cookies and sandwiches we have ever tasted! 

Cookies ($0.75) and baked goods ($2.10) actually do not cost much more than Au Bon Pain and Starbucks. You'd rather spend your $2.10 on a bagel here than wait on a line for one at a street cart. An unbeatable deal on weekday afternoons is a cookie and a small coffee for 95 cents from 3pm to 4pm. The salad buffet and all of its $2.44-per-quarter-pound glory grants relief to patrons in the form of 25% off after 3:30pm. There are also 5 registers to ring you up, so there is no worry about a mad rush or long waits.

So yes, I was talking about myself. I got over the prices as I happily scarf down an oatmeal raisin cookie and a small hazelnut coffee for my mid-afternoon snack!"
135,cucina-and-company-new-york,2009-04-07,3,"I've had a sit down lunch only once here in the restaurant area, but I've bought many breakfasts and lunches at the buffet area.

Being that it's in the Grand Central/MetLife building, this place tends to get pretty pricey.  If you get eggs & bacon in a platter, it can cost you almost $8!  Granted, these people give you like 3lbs of eggs and bacon, enough to clog your heart for a whole week... so make sure you keep an eye on the guy putting the food in your container so you can tell him to stop when it's enough.  They have an assortment of pastries, even into lunchtime (and afterwards) so not a bad place to stop in if you have a carb craving.  They have a small buffet salad bar -- a fruit bar for breakfast and a salad bar for lunch.  There are lines but they go fast since there are like 5-6 cashiers at all times.  The place is tiny, but there's always a lot of people going in and out.

Avoid breakfast and lunchtimes if you hate crowds."
136,dunkin-new-york-103,2020-04-14,4,"First time coming to this location. It's small but it's a good grab and go place. It's really kind of tucked away as well. I never actually noticed it was here until recently and I'm in the area a decent amount. 
I want to say there are a few counter seats but I don't think more than 3 seats. 
It wasn't too busy and the service was still a little slow. 
The coffee was good though. I'll be back at this location for sure when Im back in the area again."

Coffee was always hot and I will say the food was hot! Literally. I had never been to another DD where the food was that warm coming out of the oven. 

This place does not seem to have a restroom but does have some seating inside.  

During the work week , I would strongly recommend the mobile order through the app. It did get extremely busy at times.

I have definitely gone to a different Dunkin where they scowled at me for only wanting my free beverage at the time and even tried to argue that what I wanted wasn't allowed (except it was written right on the coupon).

While I was waiting for my food, a woman walked in and one of the workers was saying how happy she was to see her since she hadn't seen her in a few days and was worried. I think it's so nice that the employees recognize people and put in that extra effort. Talk about great customer service!"

I was just surprised that they made such a simple mistake. I know that the flat-breads are toasted so it's not a culinary mistake."
136,dunkin-new-york-103,2013-09-26,5,"This place rocks!!

They always remember my coffee and have it ready to go by the time I get to the counter to pay. 

(And plus, my son get's free glazed munchkins)

We're all happy campers."
136,dunkin-new-york-103,2011-10-21,4,"Just reopened and I do like the new management.  Apparently they make all the donuts and bagels in house, which is not something all dunkin donuts do.  Also they let me modify.  I've been told quite a few times at other dunkin donuts that I can't have egg whites on a bagel, but at this place a simple request is a simple request.  And the service is great.  I feel like that's par for a place that just opened up but I really feel good going in.  I especially like the black girl who works the register (before coffee I can't get more descriptive than that but if the person I'm talking about reads this... I'm the one who asks questions then you laugh when I'm shocked by the answer and tell you that this is the best dunkin donuts ever... Although I hope that happens to you a lot.)
Quality is standard for dunkin donuts.  I don't need to really say anything on that."
136,dunkin-new-york-103,2009-04-22,3,"I'm not reviewing the product (it's DD, what else is to be said?) I'm reviewing the service.

I love them! 

Seriously, I work for some crazy demanding ladies during the day...their orders are ridiculous. So when I come in here for their coffee (spouting a mile long list of modifiers) they are still polite and gracious. 

Sure that's their job...but as someone who's worked for SBUX, I remember how that would go and how I wanted punch people in the throat. 

So thank you for at least not being a b***h to my face."
136,dunkin-new-york-103,2008-12-02,1,"There are Dunkin Donuts everywhere in NY, that's for sure!  Everyone was talking about their coffee, and yes-- it is nice that they put in the cream & sugar for you.  But otherwise, its kind of just a crappy cup of coffee.  It's better than Diner Crappy Coffee, but it's still crappy!

I'm not a fan of their donuts either, but their breakfast crossaint sandwiches were pretty ok.  How sad, the only thing I kind of like isn't even their selling point!

I don't like their business hours... they close so early!  It's just convenient that they are all over the place and some are linked with Baskin Robins, which is nice!"
136,dunkin-new-york-103,2007-07-16,2,"Standard Dunkin Donuts. Decent donuts, poor muffins, poor bagels and a nice variety of coffee drinks. My favorite is the coolata on a hot day. Other than that I rarely come here and prefer the local bagel places for breakfast any day."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2020-03-11,1,"The person who made me drink was incredibly rude.  I had waited 12 minutes for my drink even though there was no line.  Every effort I made to get their attention was left ignored.  When I finally got their attention, they claimed they called my name four times, and I didn't hear cause I had my AirPod in.  I explained I only had one in, and nothing was playing.  They just yelled at me.  Mind you, the music was so loud (which I don't have a problem with), but don't yell at people if 1) they probably couldn't hear you over the loud music and 2) you don't know what's going on in someone else's life.  Everyone else was really nice, but won't be coming back with how this person treats people."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2020-02-19,2,"this is the slowest Starbucks in midtown. I don't get it. everytime I get something here and there's not much people yet the wait is eternity. And if it's busy, good luck flagging down a barista to remind them you're still waiting."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2020-01-27,2,"Normally I don't write reviews but the service was horrendous! The cashier who took my order was very sweet and polite, but the barista was berating customers for not picking their orders up earlier. He ended every interaction with a sarcastic ""thank you for responding."" When I was the only customer waiting for a drink, the barista said a drink for my name was coming up next, so I responded with ""yes, great, thank you!"" He proceeded to place my drink behind the counter so that it couldn't be reached, so 15 minutes later I asked if the drink had been made. Despite only calling my name once, he said he had called it 7 times and he had moved the drink behind the counter because I was using my phone. Not wanting to start an argument, I respectfully apologized for the inconvenience I had caused, yet he continued to berate me for ""not responding"" and even began complaining to other customers about the supposed lack of response. This would've been a one star review if the cashier had not been an absolute angel."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2020-01-06,3,"This is a very busy location as it is in the wharf of a business area- immediately opposite the ""Lipstick bldg."" They play the music very loud here and people are coming and going. They are busy cleaning up the place inside and outside but I must say the bathroom is far from clean. They have many tables to sit and and a side couch to sit up next to the glass. I'm not sure what the red and white yarn decor is for however. People come here just to charge their phones and everyone is on their phone or laptop. Even one guy with a face mask! Starbucks is Starbucks."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2019-11-07,1,"The worst Starbucks I visited ever. I went in around 8:30 pm yesterday. There were at least 4 employees there with NO ONE waiting. I waited a good 5 minutes before I finally said, ""Is anyone going to help me or do I have to find another coffee shop?"" After I gave my order to the cashier, the barista decided to resume talking and not even bother making my coffee. I waited another 5 minutes or so before I finally asked ""Is anyone planning on making my coffee or do I have to wait until right before you're closed?"" Finally, they gave me the wrong size coffee. I had ordered a Venti size and they gave me a Grande size. Their excuse: The sticker says Grande so it's the correct size. They refused to give me the correct size. I asked, ""Why would I order a Grande size when I am using my Star Rewards?"" The barista responded, ""It doesn't matter. The sticker says Grande so that is what you ordered."" When I asked for themanager or supervisor, that is when the barista decided to correct the drink."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2019-10-15,1,"I visited around 4 PM, and ordered a water with my banana bread. After 10 minutes of waiting, I asked the barista with a green hairnet, saying I had placed that order a few minutes before. She rudely replied ""oh really?"" and turned her back to me. I ended up not getting my water."

Store Location: 875 Third Ave, New York, NY 10022

      I would like to file a formal complaint.
      In light of Starbucks happy hour in 8/29, I and my colleague visited a Starbucks store with address above around 3:30pm. My fiancé, who worked in Brooklyn, visited another Starbucks store earlier than me and successfully purchased Mango Dragonfruit drink with second cup free with her Starbucks app. I ordered the exact same drink but the salesperson said only espresso related drinks were under discount, nothing else. 
      I showed him my fiancé receipt through my cell phone (Attachment A). The salesperson gave the picture to the manager. After 10 second of dead air, the manager said it must be that the Brooklyn store was unable to scan my fiancé app code (not true!) and hence allowed my fiancé to order Mango Dragonfruit drink. The manager then claimed that it was the other stores system error (very ambiguous explanation) and my fiancé offer was a rare special case. The manager also claimed that other Starbucks stores will only offer espresso-related drinks in ordinary cases with proper code scan. 
      I called my fiancé directly and confirmed that there was no app code scan issue and no system error at all! My fiancé showed me the app picture (Attachment B) and term language (Attachment C). She said the app picture (left-hand side drink), ""any handcrafted beverage"", and the term indicated that Mango Dragonfruit fulfilled the buy-one-get-one free requirement. Her colleague was also able to buy non-espresso related drink with such discount. I called another friend and he was able to buy Strawberry and Cream with second cup free too. That manager started to show impatience and said ""any handcrafted beverage"" meant espresso-related drinks only. 
      There were other customer joined the conversation and complained about the confusion too. The manager finally insisted that it was just other Starbucks stores special offers and that the Starbucks Happy Hour had no such discount on non-espresso related drinks in normal cases.

      I have complaints as following:
1. I am actually caffeine intolerance/caffeine allergic so I can only order non-caffeine drinks. The ""discount on espresso-related drink only"" actually discriminated caffeine intolerance customers. Is this Starbucks Happy Hour policy or is that store/manager personal insistence? 
2. Instead of admitting that the specific store/manager didn't want to offer non-espresso related drink discount (for profit and speed selling consideration), that manager blamed all other Starbucks with system error and code scanning issues. As he was representing Starbucks with formal Starbucks working shirt at the counter, is that how Starbucks do business?
3. I am fine if, with integrity and accountability, that store honestly admitted/confessed that they didn't want to offer discount on non-espresso related drinks. I, my colleague, and customer joining the conversation felt being fooled when the manager shirked all responsibility to Starbucks Happy Hour policy loophole and other Starbucks stores code scanning/system issues.

137,starbucks-new-york-437,2019-08-10,1,"Disgusting an unsanitary in here. Been waiting 25 minutes for a simple drink and there's only three other people here. Bathroom was horrible, poop all over the floor. I don't even want my drink now."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2019-08-07,3,"Mixed bag.  Picking up a mobile order at peak times is a disaster (long waits), but the staff is often nice.

Starbucks downgraded the Starbucks Rewards program- you have to now go through numerous steps to redeem stars from bagged coffee, and it's harder to redeem rewards for more than drinks.  Since the loyalty program now is useless to me, and I am tired of the hassle of this place, I'm going elsewhere and am pretty much done with Starbucks."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2019-08-04,2,Very loooooonggg time just to get my drink. My 1 hour break time is almost over just to wait for my caramel macchiato
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2019-07-24,1,"Stay away. Always several homeless hanging around in there. Was approached by a bag lady who wanted to use my laptop, homeless guy sleeping at table next to me with all his bags. Horrible for a place in midtown where people meet for coffee."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2019-06-06,1,"Slowest Starbucks on Earth, a frap takes over 20 mins every time, they forget your order, bad attitude, not even a ""sorry"".. Often full of sleeping homeless, dirty restroom, disgustong place."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2019-05-29,1,"the worse location ever!!!! staffs was rude and working supper slow like a turtle. No service mind, no hospitalit all they have is bad attitude to the customers. We pay for they expensive and people pay for it everyday , but the don't even appreciate it that customers is the one who keep them this jobs. Horrible Horrible Horrible!!!!"
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2019-04-03,1,"I go to this Starbucks every morning and it is never a problem for me. Today I went this afternoon and mobile ordered an iced grande cloud macchiato. I got the notification that my drink was ready, I get there to see my grand drink is half filled and warm. So I go to the barista and tell them isn't it supposed to be iced, she said yes but your drink is half gone. Not comprehending what she mean, I asked again, can I get ice. It's supposed to be cold, it's super warm. She's like you drank half already, the ice melted. I'm like I just picked this up, what do you mean I drank it and the ice melted. She gave me an attitude, rolled her eyes and then gave it to another coworker, thinking they were going to remake my drink. And I was ignored for another 10minutes until someone asked me what I was waiting for. I said I ordered an iced grand cloud macchiato which someone messed up and I'm waiting for someone to make me another one. The afternoon staff at this location is completely nasty, unprofessional, and rude. I didn't pay 6$ for my drink to get treated this way."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2019-03-29,3,"30 minute wait for my drink. The place is clean and spacious. They could use more people behind the counter.
Gets quite at around 6pm.

Homeless people exploit the available milk containers towards the front. So if you care for safer milk in your coffee, get it from the barrista"
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2019-03-09,1,"Khalil was the worst barista I've ever had service me at any Starbucks. First, this Starbucks team did not understand about the gift card law where the enterprise is to cash out any gift card under $10. Even the manager here told me that isn't a law and they were unable to cash my card out. Second, Khalil, the barista, forgot my second drink and I waited over 15 minutes. He did not care to acknowledge me when I was inquiring about the drink. Third, he messed up on my friends drink and when he made it over, he threw the cup across the table. Overall, this crew was very unprofessional and put a sour taste on me and my friends mouth. Highly do not recommend."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2018-10-09,1,They love making specialty drinks. Had my iced caramel macchiato in minutes. But my small iced white tea sat on a counter forever. And more and more cups accumulated. Lots of people running around talking or doing nothing.
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2018-08-25,2,"Disappointing. Asked for a flavored Frappuccino and was told they only had the ""regular"" ones... darling if I wanted a ""regular"" iced coffee I would have take myself to a regular coffee shop. Thumbs down!"
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2018-08-23,2,"When you step in to any Starbucks you know that you are going to wait no matter what. But in this particular location workers spend more time chatting than working and I have witnessed that more than one time. Drinks are placed wrong, iced coffee takes 25 minutes and theres absolutely no order of making drinks. Very disappointed and don't know if I want to go there anymore! Because they are such a big chain and they builded a name, it wont make a difference. I just hope that managers are doing their job and some of them will read reviews. There is so many people always lookin for a job and eager to work. 
For a fact I know that they don't get paid little money, so I don't understand why such a s*itty service."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2018-08-15,2,Terrible service. Waited for about 20 min for my drink.  There were more people waiting for coffee than placing orders.  This location needs more baristas.  The workers aren't all that bright either.  A shame because the facility is quite large and has such potential.  Won't be back.
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2018-06-05,2,"Ordered online 5 mins before i got there. I was trying to be a nice customer and not to bother the barista preparing other people drink. But after 10 mins of wait i asked them my drink, only then they realized they missed my order. No apology given."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2018-05-07,4,"I made a mistake on my order of my frape, but I didn't realize until after she made it. I trusted the barista's judgement to improvise and make it as she felt was best, but it wasn't as I normally have it. She gladly fixed it the problem & made me a better one. She was very helpful but the communication wasn't clear (she asked me about my drink the first time & i thought she understood me but I guess she didn't)  Good atmosphere in this Starbucks. Very clean. Helpful, friendly staff."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2018-03-01,5,"First time at this Starbucks, I must say I never give Starbucks reviews  being that you seen one you have seen them all, but this place is amazing the staff is fast Pleasant and friendly. There is cool funky music playing in the back. I mean you feel your a bar having drinks or a hot spot in soho. What was great to see is everyone being treated with respect. I think this place should get 5+ for the way people are  treated ; everyone from maintenance guy to the guy in the 2,000 suit. This place is clean and large. The manager should feel proud in the work his or her team puts in  do keep up the work. Great customer service."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2017-12-27,1,"Very rude stuff. Definitely I'm not going back there. Very unprofessional, they don't have attention in their orders also very rude"
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2017-12-20,5,"I love the joy of the staff here. I look forward to coming. Maria should win employee of the year! She is fast, sweet, patient and kind."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2017-12-02,1,"DON'T FORGET TO BRING YOUR EARPLUGS!
I came in to sit and relax for 30 minutes. Place looks good. Spent $9- for minimal stuff but had to listen to LOUD CRAP MUSIC which got me into a bad mood for the next hours. All the Starbucks have LOUD CRAP MUSIC that not everyone wants to hear. A paying customer should not have to put up with that. I just wanted to read  a few pages in my book and take it easy. Can I have my money back????"
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2017-11-26,1,"I was just on the line at this Starbucks location at E 53 St and 3rd Ave this morning November 25 at 9:30 am! It really made me very sad that I couldn't order my coffee on my way to work  because I couldn't stand listening to this lady who I guess was the manager at that location screaming and yelling at one of the employees all the way inside the kitchen but she was screaming so loud and cursing to this person that me, waiting on the line at the counter, I was able to hear absolutely everything from inside, that loud the lady was. I don't think any employee deserve to be treated like that. Very disappointed Starbucks should consider and check that out and see what's going on with the managers add a location."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2017-09-20,2,"so disappointed. Just waiting ice white chocolate mocha for 20 minute. Note: not busy time.
I was asking 1 employee, he just said my order and waiting again and i saw all employee doing nothing and talking each other, from all customer stand behind me until no customer on the line.
I asked other employee, that employee started to making my order. If i didnt ask maybe 1 hour they start make my order lol. Thank you your service"
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2017-08-28,4,"Probably my favorite Starbucks in the area. The line gets long at peak hours but still moves quickly. More importantly (to me), there's tons of seating and natural light. Since most people are grabbing their drinks to go, the tables are mostly empty even at the height of morning madness. It's clean and relatively quiet. The seating areas are sort of separated from the queue and waiting areas, despite the open layout. 

Independent coffee shops are my faves, but there aren't many around here and sometimes you just need to camp out and get work done at a Starbucks. For those days, come here!"
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2017-08-17,1,"They made me very late to work. If this was the first time this happened to me at this store I wouldn't be writing this. Avoid during peak hours, they don't know how to handle a rush. I did a mobile order and people that ordered in store after I got there, got their orders before I did. My order was also wrong and my wrap was like warm by the time I got it. I didn't have time to have them fix it. I've worked in kitchens and I've handled plenty of rushes, it's all about prioritizing. 

This shit happened again. They don't know how to read and make orders correctly. They tried to fix it once but still didn't get it right and I again didn't have time to have them fix it again. It shouldn't take 15 minutes for an order to be made incorrectly. If it was correct after that 15 minutes I wouldn't be so unhappy. 

I've had good service from this place recently and in the past, not sure why it can't be constant.."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2017-07-16,1,"Looks like they don't want people to stay and drink their coffee.  Loud, horrible music uncomfortable chairs."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2017-04-19,5,"I truly want to commend the staff at this location. There was a homeless guy in here this morning. He was sleeping and very dirty. Instead of being dicks about it, two of the staff members went to him and gave him a tea and a breakfast sandwich. They knew him by name and you could tell they were genuinely concerned about him. We all need to remember that this homeless man is still a human being."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2016-11-02,1,"This Starbucks has everything needed to be a great place - space; comfortable chairs; a long table; tables for 2 by the window.  However, it also has screaming, pounding, overpowering  music that destroys the environment to the point of making conversation difficult.

1* until they deal with the noise issue."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2016-08-31,5,"All my ADMIRATION for the infinite patience of the barista Brandon; I am here waiting for my coffee and one incredibly rude girl just yelled at him for not using the spoon to pour her milk foam on her cappuccino.. (It's Starbucks, get real girl!) and - best of all: immediately after that, one rude man asked to trow away his drink because ""I like whole milk, not 2%""..
And the barista just kindly replied to both of this neurotic people in a gentle way, smiled and did all again. Nicely. Chapeau to you, Brandon!

BTW: To the girl: be shamed of yourself, it's not because you are paying, that you can feel entitled to treat somebody who works like they are worth nothing (especially because your best friend if on your side and you want to prove that you are a ....); if something is not right ask, kindly and people will do it."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2016-04-02,1,this is the worst starbucks location ive been to i just got kicked out for waiting for my friend. as soon as it turned 7 pm they kicked us out for being closed. that was so unprofessional. the worker was very nasty and rude. dont even know what to say. never coming back again.
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2015-10-07,3,"This is a large one with both tables and lounge like seating. There's a lot of construction around the building this location is in, so you have to find one of the side doors. 

The coffee I had was a bit watery tasting. The cream and sugar stand is also very far away from the checkout area."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2015-08-21,3,"New location but VERY slow. 5 employees behind the counter, one making coffee for 25 people in line. They seem to always be out of milk and flavor powders. There is another one down the street"
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2015-07-09,3,"It's your basic starbucks, but the some of the staff here are rude. The cashier who took care of me mumbled and I thought he said ""Okay, swipe"" and got mad when I swiped because he wasn't ready. Okay fine, my bad. Maybe you should speak up considering it's rush hour? The rude part was he telling his colleagues behind my back on how impatient I was for coffee...really? Now you're gonna speak up. Maybe he had a bad day but this interaction just made my day go from eh to ugh."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2015-06-26,3,"Every Starbucks is always packed and its tough to get a seat. Their fare is standard at all outlets and the great draw seems to be the free wifi which attracts a lot of young singles and the fact that you always have a good restroom available.
This is my favorite Starbucks, lots of seats, wifi is fast the only problem lunch hour, around 6pm are the worst times because so many people are in here."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2015-06-17,4,"Nice size place, open with big windows and comfy chairs. Good place to get some work done or have a quick meeting with an old friend. Some of the staff seem really new and didn't really give me or my partner what we ordered properly but I'll be back anyway since it's so local to me and I'm working towards a gold card ."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2015-05-07,4,"Another Starbucks in the midtown east area - a block away from two other locations.  This is probably the best of the 3, so go here first if Starbucks is what you want.

The food and drink are equal to the standard of other Starbucks in the area, and anywhere else.  They do offer the Starbucks Reserve Coffees, so that's different and nice.

The location is a good size, but if you don't find any seating then you can go into the main building itself and on the first floor is a food court to sit in.  It has a large counter to order from and it is extremely clean (since it only opened a few days ago).  When you enter, you want to stay toward the right and head to the back; the line snakes in that direction when there's a number of people.  Also, the bathroom is also in that direction, but requires a code to get in.

The personnel seem nice and completed the orders in a descent time... in fact, slightly faster than the other two Starbucks in the area."
137,starbucks-new-york-437,2015-05-03,4,"What separates this new Starbucks (04/2015) from the twenty others in pigeon walking distance, is that it is huge compared to all of them.  Plenty of places to sit, counters, tables and leather looking lounge chairs. Or if you want to go for a stroll while you wait for you latte, you can do it without leaving the store.  

They have all your typical Starbucks coffees, teas and food items along with the cookie cutter decor.. And had extra staff who were fast in order to handle the the discounted Frappaccino raids during the the time promotional is in effect.

The entrance area is large enough to put outdoor seating if they wanted to."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2020-02-29,5,"I love Starbucks coffee, especially Capuchino and Starbucks is in my neighborhood, before I use to come here to get some work done and the place was efficient because it is a calm area to get work done, I am happy with this Starbucks because it's next to my work. The employees are excellent and always help you with any order you need with a smile."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2019-12-03,1,TUESDAY Dec 3rd- 8:58 pm- Awfully choice  to buy hot Chocolate. Such Bad staff. Very unfriendly behavior: yelled at customer that the store is closed and asking them to leave the store unless they want to help cleaning the store and the bathroom..... never go back!!
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2019-06-13,2,Very busy and crowded because of location. Staff always friendly. But for some reason they forget my drink more often than not and after waiting a while I have to ask them to please make mine. So it takes a long time to be served.
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2018-07-31,1,The wait here I just had for only a cup of ice is ridiculous!! I normally mobile order my coffee everyday at this store everyday so I normally don't have to wait but the times that I don't mobile order and I place my order in store the wait is outrages that on one occasion I had to cancel my order and ask for refund other wise I would have been late to work. Today when I walked in and just asked for a cup of ice which would take no longer than 5 seconds took longer than 5minutes. The barista that was standing there handing out the mobile order drinks was the one I asked the cup of ice from which she was literally right next to the ice and she could have just grabbed the cup for me and gave me the ice in the cup instead I had to wait a ridiculous amount of time just for a cup of ice. I won't be going back to this location again I'll just place my mo ole orders from now on from the location on 49th Broadway.
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2018-03-02,3,"I arrived extremely early in NY so I decided to grab a cup of coffee and people watch until the offices opened. Starbucks was just the spot I needed. However as I soon found out the customer service here is severely lacking and definitely not up to par. 
  I was greeted by the sound of someone humming/singing my favorite Debra Cox tune How did you get here!!!. When I looked to see who was responsible for this lovely sound I saw this young man wipe his nose with the back of his hand and immediately place a lid on someone's order...ewe!  He then took my order and afterwards I observed him cough into his hand without washing them. Double ewe!!!! I also saw the other baristas drinking and eating while making orders. 
  When my order was up the same germ filled cashier handed me my order and said have a nice day. I heard him peripherally but was too distracted trying to grab a napkin to prevent coming in contact with his germs that I did not respond back fast enough for him obviously, because he said something blatantly sarcastic. I politely smiled and said ""you as well"" ....but.. ok?!?
   I found a cozy spot in the back next to an outlet and immediately pulled out my hand sanitizer. I then proceeded to mapped out my day. 
  Although the staff is NASTY and RUDE they have good music taste. For about 2 hrs I was able to enjoy song after song and people watch. If management would re-staff/train this spot would be  perfect to spend a long delay. I was able to recharge my phone, my feet and enjoy a nice vibe while doing so. Just make sure you have some sanitizer handy!"
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2018-01-21,3,"When I was younger, I used to play a game with my friends called ""Would You Rather"". As the name so obviously suggests, one person would pose two hypothetical scenarios and everyone else would choose between the two. As one would expect, these scenarios would usually devolve into things that were designed to elicit discomfort or make you think long and hard about your choice. Now, as a full grown adult, with a crippling caffeine addiction, I face an even worse version of Would You Rather: drink the sorry offerings that the office puts out, or brave the crowds and chaos of Starbucks. 

When I do decide to go for coffee at the Starbucks in Rockefeller Center, I've sadly had more hit than misses. Given the dense number of office buildings as well as the never ceasing tourists, there can often be a snaking line just to place an order. Once the order has been placed, then the waiting game begins. After hearing Lucy's order for a Grande Skinny, non-fat, Soy Latte with 2 pumps hazelnut and a caffeine free espresso shot gets called out for the third time, my drink usually gets finished. Unfortunately, due to the new line of people queuing up behind me, the drinks are often rushed and taste sub-par. Often times, I've gotten an iced drink when I've asked for it hot, or a tall when I've asked for a grande. Fortunately, the baristas behind the bar are usually very accommodating and willing to rectify errors when they arise."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2017-07-05,1,"Extremely high traffic store needs an extremely good people, they literally have 20 ppl work and they are all over the place, waited for my darn ice coffee plain for 10 mins and when I got my oatmeal they did not put any toppings and it comes with 4 and didn't get not even one and I had to walk back from work to Starbucks to get my toppings. Very unorganized , needs a lot of team work and paying attention to details. One customer at a time not trying to move on to the next one really quick without making sure that the order is right . I spend hundreds of dollars at this store every month and this is the service we get. SMH....."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2017-03-24,2,"I'm exhausted and it's been a long day. I want a coffee with almond milk instead of cream. Due to a series of misunderstandings (I'll take my part of the blame there) I end up with a ""traditional misto"" which has like a tablespoon of coffee and the rest is frothed almond milk. I said nothing about frothing. I don't know what a misto is. I threw it away and went to get coffee somewhere else. Everyone here was very polite and kind, but I don't understand why Starbucks insists on making a coffee order so complicated."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2017-03-10,1,"What horrible customer service!  Rude kids working here.  The manager should be fired for allowing such poor customer service, literally to every customer that walked up.  It is a cup of coffee, if it is too much to serve it correctly without spilling or throwing a tantrum then you are in the wrong business.  Worst customer service of any Starbucks I have ever been to."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2017-03-04,4,"This is a nice Starbucks, very roomy for a Starbucks in NYC. I was able to find a nice place to sit and people watch. Service was great. I just don't like how all Starbucks in NYC charge for everything."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2016-09-16,5,If you are always in a rush and need breakfast quick this is by far the best location! I love the roc concourse location the staff is super friendly and they make my morning easier.
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2016-06-15,1,"Extremely slow service and only one service area open at a time.  Slow lines makes it hard to wait when you need to return back to work.  Other coffee shops in the area are much much faster, provide better service and much friendlier.  I recommend senior executives at Starbucks fire the manager and hire someone that can manage this prime real estate location!"
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2016-05-24,1,"Saw a queue at Starbucks so decided to go to the bathroom before I went to order

Came back 5-10 mins later and I was told they were closed ...... I understand businesses have working hours ..... However they display these hours so you know what time they are open till, also with top of the rock opening up till midnight and with a lot of people milling around waiting on their access time ..... Doesn't it make more business sense to stay open to serve these people since there are no other locations to buy a beverage? 

I am watching literally dozens of people walk up to it and then walk away disappointed 

The 8 coffees I went to purchase for my group could have kept you open another hour never mind the countless others wanting a drink"
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2016-04-25,1,"Drink was cold. Barista insisted it was 142 degrees or whatever is supposed to be. Gave me attitude. Thanks, Starbucks."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2016-04-18,1,It is not even busy. No line at all. I ordered cameralized Frappicino. They mess up my order. 2  people playing around and not really doing anything. People came after me got their orders. I'm still waiting. Bad experience!!!
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2015-09-04,4,This Starbucks is great. Yes there are long lines but they move quickly thanks to the amount of people working. I work in the building and come down a lot. After having not been there for a couple weeks I returned and one of the employees yelled my name and said hello. I was stunned. She was the sweetest and really seemed to care about her employees. She doesn't work there anymore but the same sentiment can be said about the others. Occasionally you'll overhear awkward conversations with the employees but it doesn't bother me. A+!
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2015-08-28,1,I really dont write a reviewbut for godsakes i had to this time. I work in this area and just like any other days i ordered ice coffee and a chocolate croissant. After 5minutes  i got my ice coffee which was perfect and then i waited for my croissant and waited..... Waited... And start noticing people who came before me were getting the pastries. So 10minites passed and i went back to cashier and asked her if they are working on my croissant and she said yes it will come up shortly. And another 10minutes passed and bunch of tourist still who came later than me were getting pastries before me. And it wasnt even crazy busy i saw a guy just walking around and chit chatting. And i finally got my croissant after my 2nd complaint from the guy who wasnt doing anything. And i wouldve been less pissed off if they at least apologize for this. And i cleared told this guy i waited 20minute for this croissant. So unprofessional! You just lost a gold member Starbucks!
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2015-08-03,3,We came here for a fruit smoothy as we were thirsty from lunch.  There was a line but the wait was not long as the employees were efficient in taking and fulfilling orders.  This is definitely a nice spot for a break during a hot summer's day in midtown.
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2015-03-12,4,"I've never had a negative experience at this location. 

Sure it is tourist hell here, but if you are looking for some good reliable wifi and seating, then this is the spot. You can people watch for hours if that is your thing. 

In the shot months this place is a safe haven. In the winter this place is a warm beacon. This is a great awesome shelter if you are seeking it. But please don't bum and trash this place. A lot of locals rely on the common seating grounds for their lunch time getaway from the office. Don't be obnoxious please. 

Other than some ignorant tourists and constant noise... This is a rather cool place to just have a cup and relax for a few minutes. 

And for the tourists... I suppose you have to stop through here since you're in the Apple. Just be respectful of us locals. That's all we ask."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2014-12-07,1,"WORSE STARBUCKS EVER! 
I understand this is located in Rockefeller and all the employees are overworked especially during the holiday season but there's no reason to have nasty attitude with the customers. 

I ordered hot chocolate and didn't know if my partner wanted whip cream on it so the cashier is like tell us later.

I go to the barista NATALIE and tell her that I want to add whipcream and she first of all has nasty attitude with the previous customer and I tell her I wanted to add whip cream. She tries two whipcream cans both of ten turn out to be empty and then she gives me the hot chocolate stating whipcream will overflow the drink! I kindly asked for her the whip she totally ignores me. I speak to the manager and he helps me out. This chick don't like her job then gtfo stupid ass"
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2014-11-25,4,This location is under rock center by the ice skating rink. It does get extremely busy here but there are usually a lot of people working so drinks don't take as long as you would expect. If you don't like the way your drink is made they re-do it for you with no problem.
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2014-08-20,3,"Located in the basement of 30 Rock, this Starbucks gets very busy.  They have a long queue, but they also have so many baristas your drink is made by the time you get to the register.  

They also have some tables hidden on either side of the counter - if you can beat the tourists with their city maps there, it can be a nice spot to take a break and read with a cup of coffee.  Though, as the basement of 30 Rock always is, it can be a bit loud."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2014-02-25,1,"Just when things could not get any worse, they did! At peak times why is this place only running at 50%?? There are two sides to this Starbucks but only one side is up and running!? WHY? You've got 20 people waiting for drinks! OPEN UP THE OTHER SIDE AND STAFF IT UP!!!!!!!!!!! LET'S GO!"
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2013-12-16,4,"I stopped by here after the watching a show at Radio City and I was surprised by the lack of wait. There was really quick service. My only complaint is that they seemed a little disorganized in terms of what my order was and knowing whether or not they could make it. I assume they tend to be pretty busy so run out of ingredients, hence my unluckiness. But otherwise, they are a sweet group and it wasn't crowded at all. One of my favorites just based on the lack of people traffic."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2013-11-23,3,"Came by to grab a cup of coffee while waiting for my appointment to get to the top of the Rockefeller Center.

Service was relatively quick to take my order and another ~5 minutes to make my beverage.

My beverage came out as requested although I noticed my barista cough with his hands and close the cover of my coffee...eek!

...they also charge tax on my already relatively expensive coffee?!?

$4.06 incl tax for a Mocha"
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2013-11-12,2,"The staff really look like they want to kill themselves. It's sad. We went there quite a few times and 1 in 5 there is a friendly person, the other times I feel like I'm just a downer on their day and life sucks. 

Smile Starbucks, smile."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2013-08-12,4,"admittedly, i'm a starbucks addict. nothing like a soy chai latte to brighten my day. i'm not quite sure how others have had such bad experiences, though... this is one of the most efficiently run starbucks locations i've visited during the morning rush. 

located underground, convenient to the B, D, F, and M trains that stop at 47-50th street/Rockefeller Center, this place sees a high volume of traffic from commuters. i usually stop at the starbucks in the 1290 Ave of the Americas building, but i needed my drank asap this monday morning... sure, there was a long line. an employee walked down the line taking orders and handing out tickets, accurately giving the orders to the baristas via headset. there was no pandemonium, no shouting, the baristas looked organized, and drinks were made quickly.

there is some seating in this location, though i doubt many use it- i thik of it as a more grab-and-go location. the side counter was stocked with the usuals (milk, cinnamon, straws, etc.) and was surprisingly clean. 

if i knew getting my morning starbucks was going to be so calm, quick, and simple, i'd have started coming to this location a while ago!"
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2013-05-04,3,"I work in this area and this is one of the two below ground Starbucks which I frequent. I find that service here is a bit slow, even when the line is short. Could it be that they get worn out from the many long lines of tourists they have to deal with? Possibly, but I still try to avoid them.

There is seating at this location, but I've  never used it. Other than that, it's your typical overpriced cup of Starbucks coffee."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2013-04-29,1,"I'm so mad I can spit!..I want to give it a 0 but that's not an option!  Service there is so bad, kid behind counter between 5:30pm and 6pm on 4-27-13 should be fired!

Six teenagers get in line for coffee before our bus leaves at 6pm just outside.  Line not too long, crowds in NYC are not heavy...it's 5:35!  You want coffee, no problem, you have 25 minutes!

Girls get in line and all six pay for their coffees...one person on register, one person grinding coffee and wiping counter clueless, one guy having personal chat with female...NOT MAKING ANYTHING!!!!

Times start ticking away...no coffees...pedestrians come up and ask for ice water...get it right away...time still ticking away...still ignoring customer orders.

""Sir can you please speed it up a little, our bus is going to leave""...blank stare...

6pm, only two coffees made, other 4 girls must leave without getting served after having paid 20 minutes earlier!!!!   No one behind the counter even cares or tries!!!!  This was NOT poor planning, it should not take over 25 minutes to get coffee when the line wasn't that long...remember, they already paid!!!  We got served a delicious and fresh lunch for 8 in less time at Fanelli's Café in SoHo!!!  And that place was hopping busy!!!"
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2007-12-28,3,"Alright, so I work in the Rock which means I should be avoiding Starbucks at all costs since the line is usually ridiculously long and full of tourists that have no idea how lines function. But usually when it's that busy, my drink is made correctly and usually before Bob from Minnesota's 35 kid size hot chocolates.

But on the day where it was, for once, not busy (because it was raining and tourists will not walk around in the rain apparently) they forgot to even make my drink. I stood there for about 6 minutes and asked if she shouted my drink (steamed vanilla soy milk with peppermint shots) ... the barista forgot all about it, upped my drink to a venti but never apologized or even acknowledged that I was the only customer standing there and kept asking 'excuse me...' 


But yeah, I still spend 10 minutes of my break waiting in line here."
138,starbucks-new-york-389,2007-05-23,4,"Do they put additives in the drinks that make you addicted? Every time I have their drinks, I crave more and more and can't stop thinking about it for up to 48 hours. Weird. 

And I actually like this one, usually on a quiet Sunday afternoon. No lines, empty chairs, really quiet."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2020-03-08,5,I can't say enough about this place. They have so many options. My personal favorite is the turmeric latte it's delicious!! They also have avocado toast and many snacks and smoothie options. Great place to bring kids and has room to sit and chat with a friend.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2020-02-20,1,I go to hunter and walk by this place all the time. Decided to try it for the first time today. Ordered a decaf drip with almond milk and caramel syrup and a coconut cranberry scone. The lady behind the register gave me the wrong scone and I immediately realized that and told her I wanted the other one. She didn't seem to understand so I told her it was no big deal I just wanted the coffee. I found myself standing around waiting for like 20 min before the woman making the coffees asked me if I was waiting for something. I told her my order and a few minutes later she gave me a cup of plain black coffee. I told her I asked for almond milk and she handed me the almond milk and told me to do it myself. Never coming back here again.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2020-02-20,3,"I'm a fan of their coffee and food, normally great service and quality. Today I ordered a cappuccino and their New Yorker. Cappuccino took a few minutes but my New Yorker (bacon egg and cheese on a roll) took over 20 minutes while the employee made other people's equally complicated food and served them first."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2020-02-15,5,Truly an amazing staff! They always find simple ways to make my day! I would honestly go just for the delightful customer service haha.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2020-01-28,1,"came in for matcha and a pastry , they were out of the pastry so the kid tells me to pick a different o e. i ask which are vegan, he tells me ""all the ones with green signs are"" so i choose a banana choc muffin and end up seeing the ingredients on the app i used to order. this muffin was not vegan.

i follow a vegan diet and have for a very long time, this is a huge mistake that you dont make. i am appalled that i was served a non vegan item after specifying that i was vegan. what if i didnt see the ingredients? this is ridiculous."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-12-18,2,"I love that they have a vegan sandwich but it's seriously such a let down. They put the tiniest portion of ""egg"" on a huge chunk of (delicious) focaccia, so most bites are just plain bread, which is tasty but not really a sandwich. I've ordered it a few times and it's always the same way. They're equally skimpy with the cheese too. It could be so delicious, but it's just not."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-12-17,5,"Ambiance: Super cute/ casual/ great study spot

Service: Quick, over the counter.

Coffee: Their coffee is delicious. I've had their lattes, cappuccinos, and black coffee. All delicious and high quality. I was in town for a few days and purchased coffee from Gregorys every single day. I purchased a bag of their medium roast coffee and wished I purchased more. Thankfully they do online orders. 

Easily on my top 5 list of coffee shops

Perks: Super close to the subway
Tons of really cool eateries nearby
Near central park"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-12-12,3,"Coffee is great, a little overpriced but that's NYC. snickerdoodle latte is great, not as sweet as starbucks, and the coffee really shines through. Pleasantly surprised. Staff are friendly, great, welcoming. 

I'm not sure about their sandwiches though. Only ordered the New Yorker to try and I won't be trying again. The picture vs the sad little sandwich I got is attached. I thought they left the filling out by accident but I opened it and it's one layer of thin bacon, hotel looking eggs (maybe poached?), and soft McDonald's looking ""brioche"" buns. Seems like the frozen-reheated type sandwiches but not even the nice ones. Better off getting a hand-made bacon egg and cheese from one of the carts."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-11-04,4,"This place has tons of seating so that's a huge plus! The drink menu is pretty extensive. I always go with a oatmilk latte or a mocha with oatmilk. I have tried the cold brew and my tastebuds can't tolerate it..it's sooo bitter. The espresso is pretty smooth and strong so I prefer that. This place has become my go to when I am in the area which is quite a lot. The only bad thing about this place is that sometimes the bathroom isn't working and when I am here, I plan to stay at least over an hour and it sucks that I have to leave due to not having access to the bathroom. All in all, this is a great spot to kill time and enjoy a cup o joe ( wait..I guess grego..xD)"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-10-07,3,Nutella cold brew was great. But the black cold brew on its own is sour. I guess the first time with Nutella it blocked out the sour flavor. It didn't taste like coffee at all. But second time I got just cold brew with caramel didn't taste any caramel and the coffee was sour. Cold brew is strong ... but still not suppose to be sour. The atmosphere is good for studying.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-09-25,1,"DON'T BOTHER...This business does not care if you come in or not...we live out of town and instead of going to our ""steady eddy"" we wanted to try a local place in the UES...I had looked at other reviews..saw mixed reviews but decided to try...we walked in...A lukewarm reception by Zary...we just wanted brewed coffee...asked what types there were..one...I'm like ONE?? Yep...basically with a take or leave it attitude..you would think atleast 2 options for simple brewed coffee..strong or weak..okay...2 coffees please and then 2 pastries...mine being ""homemade donut holes""....I drink my coffee black and when I say it was like water...that's what it was...no energy boost..no oomph...nada...so I eat one of my ""homemade"" donut holes...not good and not soft..kinda stale...so I don't complain about the WEAK coffee because Zary doesn't sound or act like she cared..but I brought the donut holes back up to her and said I ate one and they're horrible, you can take them back...she's like ok ‍...I said I'll get a piece of banana bread..she said the price and it was full price...I paid it but I thought..wow..that's a person that doesn't give one care on the world if a customer is happy..I gave you back the horrible donut holes and you still charge me full price for something else..fine take my money...so I sat and drink my weak brown water and mediocre double priced banana bread and listened to 3 customers ask if there's a bathroom...and 3 times Zary said no, it's out of service...SORRY ( not sorry)...I remember looking st previous reviews and they stated bathroom was out of order too...what's up with that?? How do you have a coffee place with no bathroom????? So..make a long story short...we threw away what was left of our horrible coffee and pastry and walked over to my steady eddy Starbies and got hot strong coffee by friendly baristas and got to use the bathroom...your coffee place sucks and that employee is horrible...get your bathroom fixed..that's ridiculous"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-09-18,4,"Perfect, relaxing place for coffee and a snack if you need to be in this part of the UES. I usually dread looking for places on the UES because this zone is like a food desert with outrageous prices like at E.A T. on Madison Avenue. So many rich people, and such poor food!!

But Gregorys was a breath of fresh air when I was on my way to Sotheby's.  The cappuccino was so much, better, larger and cheaper than the ones at Sotheby's cafe."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-09-03,1,First time coming to this location in several months and am so disappointed. Multiple workers that just stand behind their counter on their phones and chatting while there is a line of customers. Not one worker greeted anyone with a smile and seemed bothered by anything anyone had to say/ ask for.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-08-18,1,"This place is absolutely RIDICULOUS!
The woman that was working behind the counter was unprofessional using foul language.

On top of that NO RESTROOM for your customers HOW???
The owner of this establishment needs to hire better help & STOP being lazy and ensure there is always a working bthrm!!
The guacamole is some pre packaged nonsense on top of it all

I rate this place a D"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-08-12,5,"I loved the honey badger! The coffee itself was perfectly robust and the honey really came through. I also had one of the peanut butter protein balls and it was incredibly yummy. Even better, all their bake goods are 1/2 price in the afternoon. The barista at this place was super friendly and the cafe had a nice seating area. I enjoyed the modern decor and appreciated how clean it was."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-07-30,1,Was a fan until I found out my favorite barista was wrongfully let go. The atmosphere these past few weeks has been very unenthusiastic. Wish I could give ZERO stars!
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-07-03,5,"How did I just try this place?! I've noticed it for years and I finally went in yesterday and I had to go back today. Sorry Starbucks! Gregory's has the BEST coffee and espresso, fresh yummy pastries and some healthier options to start your day.  I tried the honey badger and the cold brew. They both woke me up and were so good.  I wish I tried them sooner! Very friendly staff at the location too!"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-06-06,4,Always a better choice than Starbucks! Gregorys always serves good quality coffee with acceptable prices. Waitress are nice. The place is very quiet and clean unlike Starbucks. Sometimes they have promotions for free coffee giveaways.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-05-28,5,"Overall a great experience here: fine coffee, fine price ($3.50 for small iced coffee) but excellent environment, clean bathroom, nice workers. Would definitely come back to get some work done here!"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-05-26,1,"Big disappointment! Dismissive staff with no smile at all, lousy watery coffee. I was told by emotionless staffs that there's no takeout bag, and I had to figure out how to take out four coffees by myself!"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-05-21,5,Great service and good coffee (recommend their dirty chai). They are patient with us even when we come in with the kids and work hard to be welcoming. I do miss their raspberry bars from back in the day (long before this location opened)
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-05-09,5,"This became our go-to coffee over our stay in NYC - we visited 2 locations several times. 
The latte was a latte, but that's saying you get what you want, thank you!!
Avocado toast was great (I took off the spicy). 
They have lots of add on options, cool new add ins and chocolates and snacks. I got a bite of pb chocolate ""Awake"" brand saying it was equal to 1/2 cup of coffee...just enough kick and tasted awesome!"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-04-11,1,"horrible service！
we order on yelp ，they didnt put the cable on and didnt get order，we were waiting for half hour，when we ask the lady work here，she was impatient and being rude. She was being unhappy face"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-04-04,4,"I generally go to the Gregory Coffee on Park in the 20s, which is always happening and a happy place to hang out. The energy at that Gregory is contagious.  I happen to be near here so I decided to give it a try. 

Now onto this GC.  It's a low key more relax and brighter setting.
The baristas and cashier is friendly. The latte is good.
The only disappointment is that I came here because Beard Papa's Japanese donut shop was not open fur the day yet so I came here to try the maple French crueler and was not impressed at all."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-04-01,5,"I'm not a ""sit in a coffee house and read/work"" person. I like to work in silence and my apartment is quite 24/7. 

But I like Gregory's. Really pretty interior. Nice staff. I now buy their coffee by the bag. And you get a free cup when you buy bag. Their toasts are good (ricotta honey is my favorite but they have an avocado and a salmon toast too). 

If you want to meet someone who doesn't drink, this is a good place in the neighborhood. I'm a drinker so if I'm going to venture out of my apartment for an hour or two catch-up with a friend, I'd rather go to happy hour."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-02-14,1,Terrible service. They called to tell us they didn't have the coffee flavor I wanted but neglected to say they were out of the apple fritters. So that wasn't in the bag at all when it was delivered. We asked for milk and sugar and we got coffee with nothing. The lox was dry along with the bread it came on. Maybe the food and service are better in person but we will not be ordering from here again. Really bad food for the price.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-01-15,4,"I won't lie, I do love minimalist boujee coffee shops. So when I went to NYC it was no surprise that I found this place. It's a semi small space. I came on an off peak time so I can imagine this place being difficult to find seating on a busier day. It had plenty of outlets and even hooks for my jacket. The coffee was fine and the staff was really friendly. The only thing I wish they did do (that's basically a habit in LA) is ask if we wanted different kinds of milk like almond or soy. I am so used to LA coffee shops asking me this that it didn't occur to myself to ask, leaving me with a coffee filled with milk that I already paid for to drink, hoping that my body was okay with that. Please help us forgetful people out and make sure that they are okay with milk! In 2019 I feel like it should be more common to ask by now."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2019-01-11,5,I had a soy vanilla late which was probably the best coffee I've had on the East Side. The espresso is Arabica and the atmosphere was very nice.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-11-28,5,I was passing through and looking for a Starbucks and I saw this place. Walked in and was impressed by decor and the variety of desserts they had. Ordered and my coffee was awesome. Service was quick and friendly. Will def be back. Thanks Gregory's coffee please open more locations!
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-11-23,3,"I have mixed feelings about this place- this is my first visit to a Gregory's, so I will definitely try other locations, but the baristas at this particular location are rude and seem like they hate their jobs. I got an orange cranberry scone and it is completely tasteless, but the mocha I got to drink is one of the best I have ever had. Also, the space is great, there are tons of tables and the music is just the right volume for getting some work done."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-09-08,5,"Found myself stuck in NY on a work from home day and saw this place on yelp. It was the PERFECT spot to get some work done. For such a small spot they have tons of seating. The music, the decorations, and ambiance was just awesome. And the coffee was just beautiful and the prices were surprisingly normal to low, especially for NY. I also got a brownie and some infused lemonade and everything was great. If I'm ever in NY again, will definitely come back here. I kept seeing people walk by with Starbucks and was confused! This is a WAY BETTER option if you are near it."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-07-29,5,This is a great place to work in. The staff are friendly and there is a good selection of baked goods. I live in NC and the prices here are what I would expect there.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-07-27,5,Great cold brew and pretty good iced matcha. This place has the perfect coffee shop vibe and I could easily spend hours getting work done or socializing here.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-07-10,5,An amazing experience at Gregory's Coffee. The Honey Badger is definitely the best on the menu which should be matched with one of their amazing toasts. Must go !
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-05-07,5,I love their chai whole wheat donut!!!!! It's so amazing and totally worth it!  Love that they had lemonade on that hot day!
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-05-02,2,"Nothing special in my opinion.
The cold brew was decent but service was lacking.
Maybe because I was there just a few hrs before closing, maybe because I didn't order a specialty drink, I don't know but the barista seemed as bitter as my coffee."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-04-07,1,One star is too high as the coffee is served cold and the manager refused to do anything.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-02-28,5,"I regularly hop around NYC for work and I'm always in need of a good spot to sit down and use my computer. Gregory's has that and so much more! Vegan deliciousness that doesn't just stop at having soy milk on hand. They have so many different and inventive vegan drinks and eats, I'm drooling every time I come in here. Just had the elderberry beet latte - YUM. Definitely a great go to spot for coffee, munchies, hang outs, and outlets (because let's be real, you all want to know if you can charge your phone here)."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-02-18,5,"a very good coffee, excellent place with excellent staff. will leave you caffeinated and happy(:"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-02-15,4,"Sadly no ristretto option- or at least when I visited they did not know about it. That's the only reason I gave 4 stars. Coffee tastes nice, and their scone was so delicious. They have a plenty of seatings but still cannot accommodate all the customers."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-02-11,5,"LOVEDDDD Gregory's Coffee. WISH they had locations in LA. Amazing coffee, amazing food, amazing service. Perfect place for afternoon coffee and doughnuts. Can't wait to get back to NY and visit again!"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-01-03,5,"This is a really cute joint for coffee, they had a ton of vegan bakery options as well as all kinds of coffee. I got the iced chai latte which was really good and had the perfect amount of flavor. There was a lot of space to sit as well, so we didn't have to wait and pounce to find a seat unlike a Starbucks."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2018-01-02,5,"Great tasting coffee. Got a cappuccino and it was perfection.

Love the decor here. Quiet place with plenty of seating area in the back.

My only complaint was that they don't have many savory nibble options. Most of their baked goods is sweet.

Do yourself a favor and go to Gregorys when in NY instead of the starbucks that you find on every block in the city."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-12-29,3,Love Gregory's Golden Mylk...it's my fav drink while I'm on the go. The reason I'm giving this location 3 stars is that their employees are rather rude. Each time I've gone to this location the person who takes my order just seems annoyed to be there...and it's never been the same person twice. I haven't been to any of the other locations so I can't say how they are but this one could use some improvement.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-11-19,4,"How do you like this coffee? I asked him. ""Good. 4 stars"" so 4 stars it is! Very nice neat place serves different kinds of coffees and teas and little bites. Wish it was closer to us so I can get him coffee here more often."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-10-11,5,I received great service and the employees were very kind. This Gregory's coffee is very spacious and has many outlets. This is the perfect place to study!
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-10-05,5,"Standard Gregorys Coffee (always decent quality) but wanted to give a specific shoutout to the staff who were beyond thoughtful and accommodative. I was curious about the different ""mylk"" drinks they had and their servers promptly provided me samples to try out. Awesome!"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-09-23,1,Horrible service here and specifically Anna was extremely rude.  Do not go to this place for decent coffee or service.  Many other options in this neighborhood.  I think that any of the positive reviews are probably written by friends of the staff or the staff themselves.  The regular coffee is generally poor.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-08-23,5,"Nice decor, plenty of seating space, good amount of outlets, and the music isnt too loud! The AC is a bit cold but otherwise it's a nice place to work or have a coffee. And the ""get up greg"" smoothie, which has cold brew in it,  is my new favorite thing so I'm glad this location serves it, it's not listed online or in the menu in the loyalty app."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-07-12,4,The staff here is so kind! I love coming in here. I really enjoy the energy bites and the blueberry muffin. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I didn't love the drink I ordered. I still love coming in here!
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-06-18,4,"Definitely NOT my favorite place for coffee, but it's convenient when you just need that caffeine jolt, and there's a large variety of tempting baked goods (personally I love the corn muffins). 

Convenience: 1 star
+
corn muffins: 3 stars
Total = 4 stars

Tip: if you like 3rd wave coffee that tastes fruity or can be drunk black without milk or sugar I recommend the Joe's or Blue Bottle chain around town. There's a couple of other independent shops that produce awesome coffee as well but not as convenient or numerous as those 2."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-06-11,4,"Great spot to rest while exploring and recharge (both yourself and your electronics).

Loved the iced latte though it's annoying nothing is made sweet so you have to add the syrup yourself."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-06-05,4,"The tumeric latte was interesting to say the least. It may seem like tumeric is used as ingredients in other drinks as well. 

The first sip was interesting as it tasted exactly like tumeric. After allowing your taste buds a few sips to adapt, you savor the other flavors of the latte. 

There were other unique juices on the menu if coffee isn't your thing, and each one had a unique flavor twist. I also saw a good selection of baked goods as accompanying items. 

The barista creating our drink seemed friendly, and he was fast and efficient as we observed while waiting for our latte."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-05-26,4,"I came here to get a latte after hearing how good this coffee is. The prices are comparable to some of the higher end coffee places in the city. This was a pretty good latte. Certainly not the best i've ever had, but good. The latte was well made and it was pretty smooth with good flavor. They use the same almond milk most coffee places use (Barista brand I think) and it sort of gives your coffee a plasticy taste at first. If you let your coffee settle for a bit, this seems to dissipate. I wish there was a better option out there for coffee shops. It's just not the best almond milk i've ever had."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-05-19,5,"Really nice spot, with good coffee and comfortable seating to just chat or get work done."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-05-15,5,"My caramel latte was amazing this morning thanks to Miyanna! My latte was not only delicious, it also had a pretty design on top . Thank you Miyanna!"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-05-01,5,Honestly the best place to get great tasting coffee. I come here frequently and have nothing but positive things to say. Not only are the staff friendly and knowledgeable but they're really sweet genuine people. From the plethora of blends to choose from to the calm quiet atmosphere this is my go to for all things caffeinated!
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-04-29,5,"Checked this Gregory's location, and it's perfect. Calm, cozy, great staff and excellent baked nosh-ables to go with your drink. You Gita try the carrot cake- it's unlike any other I've had."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-04-05,4,Lovely little cafe. Good to have small conversation or even read a book. Love the capuchino. Went there in a class break.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-04-02,4,"Definitely a good place to work (if you happen to get a seat). The staff is super friendly and their wifi is good (a must lol). 

Their cold brew is a must. However, their lattes are okay. Nothing special, in my opinion. 

They also gave a great selection of pastries to go along with your coffee. I've gotten the glazed donut multiple times and it's life changing--okay, maybe not life changing, but it's a really good glazed donut!"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-03-28,3,"very friendly staff and a great ambience! I could see myself working here with a laptop for several hours in the lounge area in the back.

however, as for things to buy/not buy- I ordered a latte, which was lovely. on the other hand, I also bought a boston creme doughnut which I would not recommend; the inside was partially soggy/raw dough, which was a little disappointing."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-03-28,5,"Work place, definitely, with lovely drip coffee. 

Wifi connected in a heartbeat. 

Adequate seating and pastries available as well. 

Productivity at hand."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-03-18,4,"I like their pour-over (now aeropress) coffee. Their sweets are good too, if a little pricy, and the staff is extremely pleasant. My favorite place for coffee to go."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-03-13,4,"Stopped here while visiting the city after going to the Central Park Zoo, great coffee and baked goods. The only issue is not much seating is available."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2017-01-23,5,Great coffee. And so many different sections including single source beans. They also have quiet the variety of sweet treats. I tried the cinnamon blast and rice crisp treat. The cinnamon blast is like a cinnamon roll in a muffin format with chocolate chips rolled in. Delish. The rice crisp treat was just like I used to make them with my mom.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-12-24,5,"Enjoy coming here every couple of days through the week. Never a disappointment for me to enjoy what they serve. This shop is narrow but long, with very decorated lighting and seating."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-12-18,5,"Im coming here very often cuz it's close to my home, so far the best cappucino I've ever tried in NY. Nice, cozy, warm atmosphere with planty of seats and outlets, so u can seat here for whole day doing your work on  computer or reading book.
Im still in bed (cuz sunday morning) but in half an hour I'll be there for my first coffiee of the day.
Recommendations for cortado, mocha and pastries as well."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-11-15,4,"Love the coffee.  I think they need to donate their left over pastries instead of throwing them out in the trash, that bothered me.  That's it."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-11-02,4,"This location was pleasant. Clean, comfortable interior with lots of seating and outlets. The bathroom was a lil gross, but I was there during the afternoon rush so I'm blaming the people using it and not the staff. I had an iced coffee with almond milk and my friend had a chai tea - both were tasty. Staff was really nice and quick to get us through the line. No complaints here."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-10-20,4,"Great coffee spot for studying, me and my tutor always go to Greg's being that there's free wifi and outlets and plenty of seating space. My go to is their chamomile tea and a whole wheat glazed donut super delicious a little pricey but to be expected in this area."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-09-30,3,"I've seen SEVERAL Gregory's around the city, especially when searching for places to study, so we decided to give Mr. Gregory himself a shot today. 

Enticed by the glasses logo (YAY OD's!), this was another reason why I've been wanting to try this coffee place out. 
This location has quite a few tables, however they are PEA-SIZED. As in super small, good for one person's laptop. There are a few high tables in the front that have bigger surface area, but you'll mostly find these small round ones along the wall and in the back area. They are the perfect size for a laptop though if you decide to study here. 

Their cold brew was just okk. I'd probably try something else if I come again. 
They have a big selection of baked goods, which I was very tempted to try.. but I had just come from Laduree... so maybe next time! 

Overall, not a bad choice if you're in need for a coffee break."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-09-23,4,Good coffee. Nice location. Latte art is a nice touch. Small selection of teas and decent selection of coffee.  Not as crazy as other coffee shops
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-09-03,1,"Go to Dunkin's! The donuts on Saturday morning at 8am were stale like day old wonderbread. Doughy not airy or light, and tasteless. When a coffee shop has to serve old donuts, they should find a new gig."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-08-17,4,Good coffee. Wasn't too crowded on a Sunday morning. Got coffee here before heading to church.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-07-21,2,"Decent coffee, very loud music which makes customers speak even louder to hear each other.  The staff is generally nice but not able to turn down the music."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-07-18,4,"This my neighborhood Gregory's and it is my favorite one. Anytime I have a question or request, someone has been kind and helpful. I really like the coffee and have a soft spot for the muffins. I've also received good customer support via their app about a request I had. Gregory's made it right with me and won my loyalty. Thank you Gregory's."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-07-07,3,"Atmosphere: Great for work and studying because of outlets. 

Coffee: Iced caramel macchiato was good, but not worth the price. Over $4 for a small. 

The rating is mostly for how the place looks. Maybe my opinion will change if I ever decide to get another drink."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-07-03,5,"Today very good cappuccino unlike 4 months ago. The milk is fresh & properly steamed, the cups are good quality. I'm happy they are back to their high standards."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-06-12,5,"Arguably my favorite coffee spot (I also love Olives and Oslo). The coffee here is not bitter at all and has a smooth and toasty consistency (huge coffee snob here). 

I urge all NYrs to skip Starbucks and go here instead."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-04-28,4,The coffee and service gets 5 stars! Out of TP in the bathroom gets 3 stars. Their almond milk latte was one of the creamiest I have had. I love the little tables tucked in the back of the shop.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-04-25,2,"I ordered a cold brew and a croissant here. Both were mediocre. The cold brew was way too acidic and also not cold enough. The croissant was also pretty hard. I think it was towards the end of the day though, so the baked goods had been sitting out for a while."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-04-18,4,"I had a bathroom emergency when I came (tmi I know), so I'm promptly asked one of the workers if I could use their bathroom and I promised I would buy something.
I debated whether to actually buy something because I don't like coffee. On Yelp, it says they sold tea too, so I felt better about keeping my promise. Unfortunately, when they say tea, they mean chai tea, my least favorite tea lol
So I got the morning boost smoothie, $7.00 after tax, which pretty much tastes like breakfast. It was very good, but the granola was very gritty that I kept coughing. It had banana, strawberry, blueberry, granola, low fat yogurt, and some other stuff. 
I wish they had a more extensive menu because I've seen quite a few of this franchise and the decor is always really nice, so I wanted to go in, but I'm not a coffee drinker:("
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-04-14,4,"After ignoring Gregory's Coffee for the past couple of years (didn't love their black coffee), I tried their almond latte at this location recently.  

I did not expect to be so impressed with it.  It was silky smooth, thick foam, slight sweetness.  I realized at some point that I was dreamily mmmmming out loud after each sip.    

My friend is obsessed with their whole wheat donut and when she shared it with me, I could see why.  Among all the dessert and pastry options, donuts are probably ones I could go the longest without.  However, the donut here has a very light glaze, so it's not awfully sweet, and the whole wheat adds to the texture so each bite is more satisfying.  It's quite delicious and I would get it again.  In fact most of their pastries seem rather irresistible.

Unfortunately their smoothie bowls are way overpriced for the tiny quantity, I daresay you would get a better ""deal"" (less of a rip-off) even at the unconscionably expensive Juice Press.  

Stick to their lattes and pastries."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-03-18,2,"Coffee is not bad for a chain. Overall this place could do in a pinch, but why bother when you can get a far superior cup of coffee at Shakespeare and Company just a few blocks north."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-03-16,5,"The baristas here at Lexington were just simply remarkable, friendly, and daring. Why daring? The fact that the barista who served me dared to pour my latte over the brim of the cup, AND managed not to spill it! 

Can a Starbucks barista do that? I didn't think so. 

That probably took a lot of skill, of course, so props to her. Obviously, we had some laughs over that, but it was all cool in the end. On top of that, it was a really good latte, with some really good latte art. The baristas are super friendly and chill, and the vibe is really nice because of the music. It's not as noisy as starbucks, and it also has free wifi and more seating, so give this place a try. The prices are good too, and I hope to be back here to try one of their smoothies."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-03-16,5,"So far my favorite location on account of the service being super quick. It's gregs, what do you expect? It's amazing coffee!"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-03-05,3,"Not impressed by the coffee or the staff at all, unfortunate because the place is decorated very nicely."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-02-23,5,"Loved their macchiato shot and americanos! Still pretty quiet atmosphere, they have more seats when you actually go deep inside the store, and the staff seemed to be all friendly and nice! I often drop for coffee during my school break."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-02-11,4,"Gregorys Coffee will always and forever make me think of my friend India; she worked at one of the original locations near Penn Station five summers ago for a whopping three weeks before starting her PhD program, but I remember always traveling down there just to get her to make me dirty chais. Ahhhh, memories from the summer of 2011...

Anyways...

I needed a place to crash for a few hours between the end of my work day and a 7:30 p.m. dinner. I wasn't too keen to the idea of sitting in my office for another two hours, and sitting at a Starbucks didn't appeal to me, either. After some searched, I was excited to see that Gregorys opened an UES location near Hunter College (...and I'm even more excited to see one will be opening soon, just one block away from my UES office! YASSSS!). I entered and was pleased to see a cheery place with lots of seating up front and in the rear. I ordered my chai and a piece of chocolate rugelach to and retreated to the rear to cozy up with my book for a few hours. The rugelach was delicious with a good balance of cinnamon and chocolate, and the chai borders more on authentic rather than just some chai concentrate; the notes of anise were omnipresent, which I liked.

I'm glad there is a Gregorys in this part of the city. And once its location on 68th and 1st opens, I know I'll be saying buh-bye to Starbucks when my mid-day chai cravings hit."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-02-04,5,"As one of the many fans that Gregory's has, I am in love with their lattes and their atmosphere. The staff are always so welcoming and helpful. I regularly go to this specific location and I must say that I recommend Gregory's to anyone who wants to do some work, hang out with a friend or just stop by for some great coffee!!"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-01-11,5,"This ismy second time here because I now think it's the best espresso on the UES. Plus, aeropress coffee and great baked goods. 
I like sitting on a stool by the window but there are lots of other options."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-01-09,5,"So far I have been to two Gregory's locations and have loved both!  The coffee - in my case, Almond milk latte - is consistently good- The baristas are friendly  and professional.  The clientel is interesting,  for people watchers like me.  There are outlets to charge the phone..and the restrooms are clean and in working order.  Room for me to sit and sketch,  too!..A few more vegan options would be nice ( muffins,  maybe), but even without, this place will be my new city hangout, to start my day, or pickup my afternoon."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2016-01-03,5,"There's just something about their lattes here that is absolutely amazing! I always ask for a pump of vanilla and caramel syrup -- just makes the lattes even better. Their drinks are very smooth and are consistently more-than-satisfying. This is my favorite new place to stop for coffee -- and it's in NYC exclusively! So if you're visiting NYC, definitely come here for your morning coffee!

I also love their whole ""image"" and the ambiance of the place is perfect for a great coffee shop. There's plenty of seating, outlets, and FREE WIFI. Gotta love free Wifi.

The staff here isn't particularly mean or particularly nice -- they just get the job done and make a hella good latte, so I'm not complaining!

TIPS!!
1) Download the app if you come here a lot (like me) because you get $2 off by just downloading the app/signing up and for every $50 you spend, you get $5 off!

2) Their doughnuts are actually so. good. I don't know why. Usually coffee shops' food can be ""ehh"", but they're honestly delicious. Sometimes they even have free samples at the front!"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2015-12-29,2,"My daughter and I were in the area and decided to go into the restaurant - 1st time. Service was ok until we rec'd our order and it's really the flawed process that irked me. When we rec'd our 2 drinks, no sleeves or lids were near the pickup area. I had to travel upstream from where the drinks get pick up toward the ordering area to find lids and sleeves - not easily accessible. Also, my daughter's drink had whip cream and putting a lid on it caused it to flow out the hole in the lid making a mess. You guessed it, napkins were not near. You had to fight through people to reach them and then back to the counter to clean up the mess. Then, you find that a trash can is not near. If you ask staff if they can throw away trash, they will point you across the room to the trash can. Has no one noticed this flawed/sub-optimal customer experience? If you can't do it as good or better than starbuck, then why do it. Gregory's shoukd put the lids on for the customers and clean up the mess that occurs when a cup is filled too full. If you look around, customers use a lid. As for the flavor, it was average. Nothing great in what we tried. (The 2 stars are for my customer experience with how I received my order.)"
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2015-12-22,4,"Good coffee and a nice number of seats. Very spacious. The music is a bit too opposite to the feel of a coffeeshop (they play edm and upbeat, fast pop) to be uber productive if doing work. But still, a very nice place to have a conversation with friends."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2015-12-17,5,"Stopped by for a quick coffee, and settled on the Cold Brew, which was quite good and reasonably priced $2.50. Also tried the chex mix crispy treat, which was AMAZING. Rice crispies treat but better. Actually all their pastries looked delicious. My friend got a cappuccino and said it was one of the best ones she's had. Definitely a quality place.

In addition, the ambience is warm and inviting with plenty of seating and a private-ish room in the back that seemed perfect for working. People were definitely on their laptops. It's hard to find a good coffee shop with seats, so this is definitely a gem."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2015-12-14,5,"Surprisingly impressed. Loved everything about this place. I always passed this place on the way to Hunter and never thought of going in. I was in the search for a new iced coffee spot because I was tired of settling for Dunkin donuts and Starbucks and decided to give this place a try. First off, the the whole place looks very nice, very homey if I may. The atmosphere is very relaxed. I ordered an iced coffee or as they say here ""cold brew"". Coffee resembled Starbucks but not as strong which is a plus. Prices also resembled Starbucks. The employees were nice and happy to help you with any questions you had. Also there's free wifi just ask for the password. Bathroom was very clean. Outlets right under your seat! Had the milk and sugars on the side. Also have a self serve water station for free! I can't say enough good things about this place. Will be coming a lot in the foreseeable future. Great job Gregory."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2015-12-09,5,"Awesome coffee! Get an aero pressed coffee, don't be a cheapskate and get the regular drip, you're wasting your time if you do. Might as well go to Dunkin or Bucks! Cough up a few bucks for the aeropress single origin. You won't regret it."
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2015-12-04,4,Go here all the time. The staff is friendly and the coffee reliably good.
139,gregorys-coffee-new-york-18,2015-11-19,3,"good coffee, but the barista had a bad passive aggressive attitude pretty much every time. if people working at dunkin donuts with high pressure and traffic can have a good attitude toward customers, i don't think it's too much to expect a barista here to at least keep her bad attitude to herself."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2020-02-10,5,"Good spot for coffee. The staff is great. Very attentive and friendly. My go to place when I am in the neighborhood.
A birthday shout out as well. Thanks!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-11-09,2,"A nice little coffee shop but....

We both ate completely different things for breakfast and lunch, and within 30 minutes of drinking the hot chocolate here felt extreme stomach pain. We will not be back."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-10-25,5,I love Gregory's!!!  But this is my favorite location!!!  My staff is so nice!!  Impeccable service! The store is clean & well stocked.  It's always a great experience!!
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-10-25,5,"So I just started the keto diet and needed help with ordering a drink, to my surprise there's a drink just for that. It was delicious. The baristas educated me on the drink and I shared some keto tips, they were all very sweet. The music is great, every corner is squeaky clean, and the drink was delicious. If you're in Midtown looking for a good coffee shop with friendly service, come here. Oh, and download the app for a $5 reward ;)"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-10-18,5,"If your looking for a fresh & new coffee experience definitely try out Gregory's! My barista, I believe her name was Yanna, was very sweet and eager to help with my latte choice (try your latte with their macadamia nut milk, it's the absolute best!). The Madison Avenue location is such a cute, clean & very quaint place; I will be returning each & every time I'm in the area."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-10-09,5,"Visited here as a tourist from Atlanta, GA. The service and product was exceptional! The barista in particular I think her name was Priscilla was very sweet and attentive to my drink and provided excellent customer service. Will be back."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-09-21,1,"I have simply had it with this place.  Serviced by a bunch of millennials who could care less about you, your food, or how long you need to wait while they check their latest Instagram post for how many likes they received. I especially like when they are conversing with their friends while half assing your latte and your wondering why does it take 20 minutes to get a coffee when there is only one person ahead of you. I'm done, it's the inspiration I finally needed to walk an extra block. #justnotworththeattitude"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-09-04,5,I enjoy coming to this particular location Whitney Whittey is an outstanding manager she makes my day even when I'm down and not having a good day. She is very prompt and always know what I want and even recommend particular things to try.  I wished there were more stars  to give
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-08-23,4,"One of the best coffee at town.
The store is clean and the service is good. 
Good quality coffee."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-06-29,3,"An alright place to get something on the go. I've came here to quickly get a quick snack such as a scone or a muffin if I'm in a rush. They get the job done, regardless of how chaotic they can get."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-06-04,1,"Ladies at the cash register insulting customers right in front of them, chaotic order taking, they don't have any idea who ordered what and try to ring you up for extra things. Staff retraining needed!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-05-21,2,"Staff needs some improvement.  About half the time I order a breakfast sandwich the order never makes it from the cashier to the person who makes the sandwiches or the person making the sandwich forgets.  This morning, for example, the guy forgot and I was stuck waiting there for 15 minutes until I spoke up and was given a burnt breakfast sandwich with no apology.  Product is also overpriced."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-05-21,5,Carlos was exceptional with taking care of the issues we previously encountered. The staff was great this time around. We look forward to stopping in again.
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2019-01-25,2,The staff here tends to be slow and inexperienced. The only reason for 2 stars and not 1 is the good quality of some of the drinks. I prefer Starbucks who have better trained employees.
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2018-12-06,4,"Really nice location. I loved the idea of filling a growler with cold brew - that's unique! We tried an energy shot (with algae!) and a honey badger iced coffee. Nice amount of caffeine and great honey taste. We also tried the peanut butter and regular energy balls and those were delicious. I loved the text, especially in the peanut butter one. Line didn't take long and plenty of seating so that was a plus."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2018-12-03,2,"Love Gregory's coffee but this location is my least favorite.  I find that my iced lattes are always inconsistent, one day they will be the shade of straight up milk and the next day it will actually look like there's coffee in there. When I asked for an extra shot of espresso (willing to pay for it) I was given an attitude by the employee (tall man).  This disappoints me bc I love Gregory's but have stopped coming as this has happened way too many times."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2018-11-28,4,"Always come here in the evenings to get chai tea latte for energy to carry out the end of my work shift. Good quality tea, but definitely not the best I've had. Also very overpriced, but hey that's Manhattan for you. Service is excellent, everyone is very super nice and friendly. Would recommend to grab coffee on the go, but definitely would not go out of my way."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2018-10-31,3,"I may be mistaken from the start - I got a Matcha Latte instead of coffee. But hey, if you sell it, it should be good. And for $5+ for a small Matcha Latte, I can't say it was worth it. 

As others have said, this location gets busy in the morning, so allow at least ten minutes to get your drink."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2018-10-30,3,"Really like this place.  The coffee is pretty good, but the service and friendliness of the staff really make this place stand out.  But what happened to the staff that was there until about a month ago?  There seems to have been a massive purge or something.  The new staff is very nice as well, but still."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2018-08-04,3,"This is a clean and pleasant Gregory's location with fast staff and plenty of outlets, not to mention good WiFi. It's got six small tables and it gets so busy, so it'll be tricky to find space to sit. It's also a much smaller Gregory's than usual, and I don't think they have a bathroom, so it's not the type of place you want to lounge around in for a while. 

I got the charcoal latte made with almond milk, and I actually didn't enjoy it. Just didn't taste good. This was the first time I didn't enjoy a G latte. I'd just steer away from that one! 

I did also share a banana cake with a friend here, and that's always a winner. You can't go wrong with a thick, fluffy, juicy, fresh slice of that. The pastries are always fantastic, and some of the best around. 

Gregory's will always be one of my favorite cafes around. The staff is always friendly and efficient, and the coffee is solid!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2018-06-30,5,"this coffee bar is adorable! great decor, lively environment despite the minimalism, fabulous menu, and great staff! they were out of the hall and oats when i went, and so i got a nu-brew. since i'd been charged for my 12oz hall and oats already though they gave me a 16oz instead without upcharging. so nice to see service like this in NY. the menu has so many incredible things i want to try and i highly recommend this spot."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2018-05-01,2,"Relax
The girl finishing up her shift right now (around 2:00) can take it easy with snatching away iPads from customers and yelling ""Miss"" irritably. Just put the drink on the counter and relax."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2018-04-25,5,"So happy I stumbled upon this place - didn't even know they existed. So far, I've tried their cold brew (9/10), chocolate buckwheat ball (10/10), and elderberry toast (10/10).  Everything is amazing.  The chocolate buckwheat ball and elderberry toast might be the best things I've ever tasted AND they're low in calories.  I can't wait to go back and try their juices/smoothies. 

***Considered giving them 4/5 stars because their service was a bit on the slower end the two times I've been there, but that won't stop me from going back."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2018-01-16,5,"When I moved to NYC a few months ago, I told myself I'd never buy coffee to help save money. Yet here I am, getting Gregory's at least three times a week before work. The coffee is amazing, and definitely one of the best I've had in the city so far. Something else that really sticks out to me are all of the vegan and gluten-free food options. The crunchy power bite is my favorite. 

In addition to the food/drinks, the employees at this particular location are great. They're quick, yet even when they're in a rush they answer your questions in a caring manner and are always polite and helpful. One time during the morning rush, I accidentally placed my order to a different location (on the app) and they gave me my order no problem and told me ""it happens."" I'm used to employees getting annoyed when you make mistakes like that, but they were chill and
understanding about it...how it should be. Whoever is in charge of the employees here, they're the best! 

P.S. Download the app. You don't have to wait in line and you get discounts sometimes!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2017-12-26,2,"The pastries were hard and the pumpkin spice lattes were not good 

We also had hot chocolate and it was warm"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2017-10-04,4,"I don't normally like Latte but their soy latte is pretty good. Like, I can have another one."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2017-07-27,5,Probably the best barista style coffee I've had in the US! A fantastic little spot with a lot of charm and tasty looking treats.
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2017-07-25,4,"Service was good, coffee was fine."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2017-04-13,4,"I dropped in around lunchtime today for a treat to satisfy my sugar craving. Gregorys is one of the few cafes in midtown that carries vegan baked goods that aren't muffins or banana bread (why is it so hard to find a vegan brownie or cookie around here??), so I was excited.

***LOCATION & INTERIOR***
There are a bunch of Gregorys scattered in the area with barely a few blocks between them. It's a staple for office workers nearby so expect long coffee lines in the morning. This location has a dim, quieter interior, and is surprisingly roomy. There a large ordering counter full of every baked good imaginable.

***FOOD***
I don't drink coffee so I can't attest to their drinks, but I will say that a lot of people I work with get coffee here on a regular basis.

There were 2 vegan treats available--the vegan bar and the berry coconut scone. I don't know how accurate the calorie counts are, but according to myfitnesspal the bar and scone are both less than 200 calories, making for perfect small afternoon treats or a complement to your coffee. I decided to go with the vegan bar, which was small but pretty hefty. It was mildly sweet and just tasted...healthy. Like, a lot of nuts, berries, etc. going on.

***NOTES/RECOMMENDATION***
The location and pleasant interiors make Gregorys a standout among the bajillion cafes and espresso bars in midtown. Extra points for having a few diverse vegan options!

Also, a tip: get the payment app LevelUp for $5 off your first order here and rewards for frequent visits."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2017-01-31,5,If you haven't been to Gregory's you should check it out. Coffee is great and a variety of selection. I love the muesli oatmeal and banana nut cake . It's worth the money.
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-12-21,4,Found this on yelp when needed a good coffee - great capuchino - companions had dirty chai- chai with expression shot. All good - highly recommended
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-12-14,5,Super cute place! We were running around the city and it was nice to rest our feet. My husband was wanting a donut and we found out pastries were 50% off after 7 or 8 pm; added bonus. Great service; there's a guy who works here that's a perfectionist. I saw him make a drink twice to get it absolutely perfect; you don't see that very often!
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-11-20,4,"This is a great location with a nice rustic design from the inside. They have funny signs and posters related to coffee as well. There is quite a bit of seating in the inside and it doesn't seem to be too crowded during the afternoon. There was only one or two other people in line when we got there. Service was quick and efficient. I ordered a latte with vanilla syrup and they did a pretty good job. It was well steamed with just enough sweetness and stayed hot for quite a while when we were walking outside in the cold. I have not tried the other Gregory coffee locations before, but this one does a pretty good job making coffee. Plus, they have healthy stuff on their menu such as juices and nutritious foods. I would consider possibly trying this place again."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-11-02,5,"I am so happy that Gregorys Coffee is close to my office. I love the coffee, I love the service, I love that when I bring in my own coffee mug I only get charged for a small coffee, I love that the baristas always fill my mug up to the top. These are the little things that are in stark contrast to my formerly favorite coffee shop, which would only fill up 2/3 of my cup and once filled up a disposable cup to show me how much they should pour into my coffee mug."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-10-31,2,"I have to say I am not a big fan of this place. I am here often for people at work who very much enjoy Gregory's. The coffee is fine; it's not my favorite but it is ok. I mean I am more of a McDonald's coffee person (seriously if you have never had the McDonald's K-cups you are missing out, BEST COFFEE EVER) but I can drink this. My issue with Gregory's specifically this one is I swear to god they are always training someone new. I find it to be the most irritating thing ever. Every time I go in there someone is being trained on coffee temperatures or how long to steam milk, or to taste the espresso they made to see if it tastes acidic .....UGH please just give me my order. I understand training needs to happen but why does have to happen always and with new people? Waiting around for someone new (not their fault) to make drinks is super stressful especially when there are people there who could speed up the process."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-10-10,3,"Good coffee and treats. Been coming here since it opened as it's convenient to office. Original baristas were super fast. Current barista, and for that matter all the staff, are very nice but painfully slow (all new). Gotta move things faster. Sometimes the line is out the door and still they don't move any faster."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-09-27,5,"I've been going here for years. It's incredible, and located all around midtown which is super convenient for me (I go to school in midtown east). The chia seed pudding is incredible, but only located in some locations. It's so simple and delicious: chia seeds, almond milk, and honey. 

The crowd is definitely more ""9-5"", but ignore that and get an iced coffee while you're there! Maybe try a red eye! Everything's great here!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-09-09,3,"Fantastic coffee but they really need to get their service act together. I don't like having to order twice. Also don't enjoy waiting 15 minutes for my drink. They had four people at the cashier, and only one making beverages with six people plus standing on top of each other waiting. The kind of surly manager thcame out and jumped behind the register. No bueno."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-09-09,5,"Oh my goodness what a great and friendly staff to start the day! I have had Gregory's coffee before and was bummed when my office moved. To my surprise I was told that there was a Gregory's in close proximity to our new office. 

I have now been to three locations and they are consistent. Friendly and courteous staff with reasonably priced and delicious coffee. You can taste the freshness in each cup. 

If you feel like trying something different I highly suggest Gregory's to anyone. You will not be disappointed!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-08-18,2,"Had a meh macchiato (see photo).  Foam was just floating on top of the espresso; I think it was over-steamed rather than being microfoam that infuses into the coffee.  

The espresso itself was tastey but the foam was a fail.   I'd stick to brewed coffee here."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-08-04,2,"The people who work there are so not nice.. Those type of workers you feel sorry they're having a bad day, but they shouldn't take it out on the customer :-/"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-07-28,2,Coffee at this location is BAD.  Watery and so hot it taste Burnt.  Service is hit or miss. Sometimes their quick and sometimes the line is out the door and slow.  Also the Latte's are hit or miss depending on who the Barista is.  How is it possible that there is no good rich dark roasted coffee in Midtown?  Oye. Roll the Dice on this one but don't order their coffee unless you like brown hot water.
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-07-26,3,I was looking for place in area to do some work with wifi. I found Gregory Coffee and decided to check it out. It's a cool spot but a little small/loud for my purposes.
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-07-26,4,"Coffee was great, tasted phenomenal and provided ample energy and focus - much better than their competition can offer. Only downside was that nobody working there told me it would stain a white shirt. Management should consider instructing their baristas to warn the customer as they hand you the cup like Star-buckers does."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-07-13,1,"$4 later and 1"" is missing. Barista wasn't ""allowed"" to top me off per Co. ""rules."" Shame on Gregory's Coffee for not putting customer svc 1st."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-06-08,4,"A good coffee with almond milk and soy options. None of that Starbucks drivel! 

And good tasty healthy options for brekky too. 

Win."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-05-24,5,"I'm so glad Gregorys is in NYC.  Just need one closer to my midtown west office bldg.  Get the vegan bar (and I'm not a vegan - they're excellent) and the carrot / zucchini / walnut bread - all their pastries basically rock, as they are sui generis!   The mobile app is also handy - always nice to get $5 for every $50 spent.  Lastly, I keep looking at the new downtown Brooklyn location, hoping it opens soon."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-05-24,4,"One of the smaller Gregory's Coffee places in town (not as much seating as other locations that I know). I only come here if I'm visiting my friend at work because her office is nearby -- which is convenient for anyone that works on Madison Avenue. 

A lot of people come in here right before work to get their coffee fix, but there is also a lot of people working here at all times, so it moves pretty fast.

As Gregory's always is, there are tons of bakery food options and the lattes are great. I personally think the lattes are a bit better at other locations, but it really depends on the baristas. Always love me some Gregs so it's good!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-04-21,3,"The coffee is great and the tea as well but they don't have a public restroom. I wasn't please with that at all. It's also a very busy place so it's not the best shop to come and do work. Great customer service though, I would come back but not to sit in."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-03-22,3,"Nice place
Try the volcano coffee it's like espresso coffee but it's nice watching them make it in the coffee pressure machine. Try the brownies that amazing."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-02-13,5,"I  stumbled on Gregory's Coffee  a while back,  when I was visiting my foot doctor.   I am a vegan, and always in search of a well made Almond Milk Latte. Gregory's Coffee on 46th Street did not disappoint .  Since then I have tried several locations.   This one on 55th is small and cozy,  crowded or not, depending on the weather.  Their almond milk latte is superb,  and I always seem to find a seat near a charger.  The baristas know their stuff. The staff is friendly,  and the place is clean..One minor flaw, there is no restroom at this location,  but if you are familiar with the area, there are some accessible ones in the area.

I wish they would open in Queens...Forest Hills in particular, but until they do, Gregory's remains a permanent  part of my city itinerary."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-02-06,4,My fiancé and I happened to come upon this place on our walk home. It is in a good location and the atmosphere was quiet and clean. He got the chai tea and I got a latte. The latte was a little weak but the chai was great!
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-02-02,4,"Exceptional coffee, friendly & skilled barista's, chill atmosphere.... what more do you need in a coffee shop?? I am partial to the cortado, or just black coffee. I've heard their sweets are very good, but have not tried any to date. I look forward to returning to Gregory's more often in the future!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2016-02-02,4,I've been to several Greg's Coffee in the city and I always get their Americano. It's a nice trendy coffee house that is not a Starbucks for a change. The staff were friendly and they know how to make their coffee.
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2015-12-02,4,"Stopped by to redeem a one-day-only LevelUp credit.  Friendly staff and fast service here during the lunch hour.  Similar in size to most Gregorys Coffee locations (though I prefer the one on 44th St because it's larger and has more seating available).  A wide array of sinfully rich pastries are available, as well as some yogurt in the cooler.

-Pumpkin Muffin ($3 total): Pumpkin spice, raisins, walnuts.  Soft, but with just the right amount of crispiness along the edges.  Get it!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2015-10-09,3,"Tucked inside Madison avenue, this Gregory's opens at 6am and carries almond milk (both of those things make me happy). It's the sort of coffee shop that you just need to be ""okay"" because it's right by work or on your way to running errands. On the pricier side for the quality of the coffee."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2015-09-18,4,"Definitely a chill spot with a great cold brew. I wasn't expecting the ambiance at all but granted we were there about 3 hours before closing. They have some snacks and such which we didn't try, free wifi... Only downside is no restroom though I'm pretty sure that's typical in the area. We had to go across the street for the restroom. The staff are super nice... I overheard someone talking about being given an IOU basically, earlier in the day, and was coming back to pay the debt. So cool. Not many spots would be willing to spot patrons that I know of. Gregory's is cool."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2015-08-17,4,"Best iced coffee in the city.  The cold brew is so good that it almost tastes like chocolate.  However, the coffee is quite pricey ($4 for an iced coffee).  I wish they had some healthier food options.  The chocolate croissant and the gluten free Chex Mix treat (like a Rice Krispie treat) is relish."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2015-08-12,4,"My fave salesperson Dawnya, from the Walking Company UES, told me about this spot. In return for impeccable service, I wanted to treat her to a coffee, treat, and water. All about balance, right...

A single origin getting its drip on while the Barista and I chat was cool. To my right was Dawnya, leaving with her own coffee and treat.

Aw shucks, these were for you...next time...next time.

The Barista was ready to refund the order so quickly. Maybe it was a psychological marketing ploy playing on my I hate waste frugality...And she was very cute...

But no. I bought my order.

On the UWS, there are great coffee shops, so I was not blown away. The taste was great. No sugar needed. No cream needed. Coffee. The way it is supposed to be. The Cinnamon pastry was bipolar sweet/tart. Worked well with the Honduras Roast.

It will probably be part of my routine when shoe shopping."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2015-05-14,4,"Stopped by after finding out their baked goods are half off in the evenings using this new app called PareUp. Banana bread is particularly tasty, but their oatmeal cookies are unreal."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2015-04-12,3,"A decent coffee shop.  I found my first cappuccino here was really nice.  The 2nd time around it tasted like they had over roasted the beans.  It was really bitter and tasted burnt.  The staff here is always friendly and they have a selection of gut busting treats to tempt you.  Again, good spot but just a bit hit or miss."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2015-03-24,4,"Good coffee and good pastry! I ordered a cinnamon blowout and wow it was crispy and tender and not overly sweet. Also, the place and service are both nice."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2015-02-11,4,"WiFi is great and coffee is awesome. But, service can be slow when crowded. The seatings should be rearranged to give more space to customers."

He would buy me coffee and tea whenever he's in the mood....lol..i was sick, and he bought me green tea from here...the tea tasted bitter and raw...wasnt what i was expecting since i drink alot of asian tea and they can be bitter, but it never tasted raw..hmm...

Although the tea did not live up to my expectations, but the coffee here is pretty good. I also had their baked goods as well, and they were yummy. It's a nice change when you dont want to run to starbucks..XD"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-12-18,5,"My new favorite jam in midtown. This place is fantastic. The staff are always so attentive and nice. The coffee is great and the pastry options will make you want to add a couple holes to your belt. This place is really good.  Go here if you're in need, in the area, heck go out of your way, its awesome."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-10-30,5,"By far the best coffee in the neighborhood. Single cups via Aeropress with your choice of beans. Fantastic espresso. 

Great donuts, too!

Highly recommended. Thank god this place showed up in the neighborhood."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-10-27,2,"Apparently if you add glasses to anything you're labeled a hipster and we all know hipsters KNOW coffee. DO NOT be deceived by the glasses that Gregory wears, this is your run of the mill Star$'s coffee.

Sizes range from small (12oz) medium (16oz) and large (20oz). This would work for people who prefer their coffee with a good amount of milk/water but it doesn't work in regular cappuccinos, which should be made with a shot of espresso and foam. The cappuccino tasted like a regular latte with non-fat milk, and the regular latte tasted like a light decaf coffee.  Basically, they tasted kind of commercialized: quantity versus quality.

The beans here are a tad sour and the latte i ordered was served a bit too hot (venture to guess 180+) similar to how Japanese restaurants scald there sake to cover up the terrible taste.

Service was quick with my order filled within 5 minutes. Decor is clean, similar to a Starbucks but with a different color palette and more minimalist look.

Coffee ~ 2/5
Service ~ 4/5
Decor ~ 3/5
Price ~ 3/5"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-08-25,5,"Fantastic coffee! That's all you really need to know. That's all I really care about at a coffee shop. The staff was pleasant too, if that matters to you. Worth a stop."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-08-15,3,I go here for consistency. Today was an epic fail. The barista was a woman I have not seen before and I'm disappointed in her skill level. I'll be back because I work nearby but avoid a soy cap if she's in sight. It's too bad because I use to come here knowing it would be spot on every time and that's no longer the case.
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-07-14,2,"I like Greg's coffee but this is my first time at this location.  Smaller store with not much room and if you didn't know it was there you would most likely miss it.  Kind of cruddy service with a apathetic attitude from the baristas.  Coffee was good, took it to go.  Not much else to say."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-07-11,5,"Cute coffee shop! Love the peanut pleaser - it is soy milk, banana, peanut butter and whey protein! It is absolutely delicious! Prices are reasonable. Service was very friendly and enthusiastic! Loved the environment of the shop!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-07-03,4,"I like the coffee here; I'm not an aficionado and mostly stick to drip coffee, but like their results. The decor here is slick and pleasant; feels like a half-notch up from the typical Starbucks. I got dead-eyed service just now from a young trainee of some sort, but the brisk manager jumped in and rescued the interaction. I disagree with another poster that it's the only good coffee in east midtown though; there are quite a few excellent options within ten blocks if you look around a bit. Little Collins, 9th Street Espresso, Demarco, Pennylane, Joe, etc., etc."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-07-01,2,"Coffee is fine but seriously the internet is never working when I go there. I'll spend my money elsewhere, where I can get Wifi. What's worse is that they don't tell you until after you pay. So you've already forked over $6, and then you find out you can't access the internet. Very frustrating, esp for tourists and those meeting for meetings."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-06-27,5,"Definitely one of the best coffee shops in mid town area. I loved their no sugar version of vanilla latte, just about the right level of sweetness and smelt so attractive. They had good environment as well and you can even walk around central park with a cup of latte in hand. Strong recommendation for anyone looking for decent coffee shops!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-06-12,3,"I ordered a dry cappuccino.  I received a not very well made latte with almost no foam.  I paid something like $4.50 for a drink that is not what I ordered (or very good).  

If you're coming here, stick to the regular or aero-press coffee.  That being said, this is definitely the best coffee in the wasteland that is east midtown."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-04-07,5,"I've been stuck in meetings for the past two weeks in what I thought was the dead-end coffee area of mid-town Manhattan; a word of Starbucks and spotty deli coffee. Than goodness I found Gregory's to out a little punch into my dreary day. The espresso is legit and is up there with Grumpy and other real and rare New York coffee houses. Thes staff is friendy and knowledgeable and can talk jntellgenty about what they are serving.

I can also recommend the chai tea. It's not normally what I'm into, but my coworker gets it almost every day and is getting me hooked.  The pastris are kind of off the hook too and I try not to nook at them as I walk in because my wife tells me I'm getting a middle age guy gut ;)."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-03-26,3,"This was a quick stop in for a light breakfast before work. Cute place! The people were really friendly and awake lol I was not. I just got a green juice and a glaze donut which totaled to $11.75!!! What the world!? That was super expensive, but I told the cashier guy that this $10 juice better bring me instant health for that much money! It was good, just juice, but I enjoyed my experience all 10mins of it :) I'm gonna go back."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-03-18,5,"The best addition to this neighborhood in a very long time, hands down.

The rotating single origins are my go to, but the occasional espresso is thrown in as well.

The staff is phenomenal. Not only are they friendly and make great coffee, I was instructed in how to use both the Aeropress and Chemex coffee makers.... everything from water temp to prepping the filter to grind size.

They have changed my view on coffee, and most definitely increased the quality of my mornings.... and afternoons.... or whenever I stop by."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2014-01-23,5,"Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their espresso. I get an americano from this place almost daily, and couldn't be happier with the service and quality of coffee. The cherry on top is their pastries - absolutely fantastic. They're always fresh (baked daily), and are delicious. Also, I believe it's 1/2 price off all pastries after 5pm.. What a deal. My favorite is the banana walnut bread - damn is that stuff good.

Perfect unassuming coffee shop in an otherwise dead area"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2013-12-04,5,"They do a great chai here, and if you go in the fall they have an apple cider chai that I love. The staff is always super friendly and there's always a place to sit. A great coffee place, especially for midtown."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2013-10-09,5,"I go here almost everyday and these guys always go above and beyond. All the employees are super smart, energetic and willing to help in any way they can . I had an issue once with my ""Gregular"" card (which btw everyone should have!) and the manager jumped right in and saved the day - no hesitation. Seriously, best customer service in the city!"
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2013-10-08,3,"Expensive. Coffee is overpriced and not great, back to Starbucks I go (assuming no Dunkin Donuts to hit up).  On the flip side some of their sweet treats are pretty good. S'mores cookie is yummy and the chocolate coconut donut is pretty tasty (very sweet) too."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2013-09-16,1,"After two visits to this location, I can say with certainty that I will not return after encountering the condescending staff. After ordering a $4.45 quad espresso over ice, I was questioned, ""you know we make lattes, right?"" and told that I would be charged for any milk I put in my quad (after making no indication that I intended to).

The person at the register proceeded to call over a manager, who questioned why I had requested a large cup for my iced quad espresso and again reiterated that ""quality control issues"" prevented them from allowing patrons to add their own milk to espresso drinks.

To be condescended to AND to pay $1.24 more than the equivalent beverage at Starbucks is absurd. Suffice to say, I will not be returning to this location."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2013-08-21,4,"Coffee, medium roast, hot[1].

If you give me a cup of that for my birthday, I won't complain.

If you happen to live or work or gym or scandalize in this neighborhood, Gregorys has got your back[2].

[1] Thank you, replicator.
[2] And in the rare case that they don't, you can always use their free Wi-Fi to find a place that will."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2013-08-15,5,The shakerato was recommended by the barista and was great. You can taste the high-quality espresso.
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2013-08-08,4,"While I'm still loyal to Think coffee, I'm really happy with this newly opened Gregorys here in the dead spot in midtown.

The Costa Rican Iced coffee has good after taste and aroma of roasted beans, which sometimes hard to have for iced coffee. Definitely this iced coffee wins over the one at Starbucks.

I also love their basket of caramels right next to the cashier. While many other coffee shops keep mints/chocolates/small baked goods there, they offer forgotten one of the best friends of coffee! The handmade caramel made my office hour happier for a while..."
140,gregorys-coffee-new-york-6,2013-08-01,4,"Woohoo! 

Coffee next to my gym, eh? This is bad for me. Caffeine and adrenaline is a deadly combo. 

What makes it worse is that the baristas are hella friendly.

There's about 6 small tables here, a long bench with outlets, and chairs. 

Yes, outlets."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2020-03-13,5,"We were on our way to Central Park and were looking for a ""New York"" place to eat.

We ordered the smoked salmon, smoked salmon brioche, tuna salad, Nutella waffles, and kale salads.

All the food was wonderful!!

The coffee was irresistible and the French bread melted in my mouth.

Come show some NYC support!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2020-03-09,4,"A bakery with (or an attempt at) a French cafe flair:  the baked goods are 'good', and worth it an eat.  We had breakfast, and had a tasty dining experience.  Service was attentive, and we did even feel rushed out, even though the number of seats was small.
We came back later and picked up items for the roadtrip too."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2020-03-05,4,"This bakery had some good looking items to choose from in their display case.  It was difficult to select only one item but I finally settled on a raspberry financier.  It looked just like a muffin with a few berries in it but it much better than that.  Once I bit into it, it was full of raspberries.  It was absolutely delicious.  The bakery is nicely decorated and appears clean.  Others must like their product as well since it appears to always be busy.  I hope to stop back in tomorrow!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2020-03-05,1,This bakeri comes up as gluten free bakery. Don't waist your time going here for that. They had 2 options and vegan croissants.
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2020-03-03,3,Cute little place in the Hudson yard. We stopped by for a quick snack and drinks after going up the vessel. Also stopped at their other locations a couple more times throughout the trip to grab coffee. Only giving 3 stars cause it's not extremely memorable but still better than average.
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2020-02-19,3,"The food is good buuuuut... they get 3 stars because the sit down service is soooo slow!!! There appears to be enough servers so I don't know what the issue is. 

Took a good 10 min just to get my order taken and while I waited a lady stood up and walked up to a server to get their attention because she needed cream for her coffee. The guy behind me flagged down a busser for service the guy responded  by making the ""just a min"" sign with his hand (he finally had to get up and find the server so he could ask for whatever it was he needed). 

My coffee took another 10 mins to appear.... you get the gist of it. You are gonna wait. 

I was here a few months ago and decided to give this place another try because it is conveniently located super close to my hotel but this may be the last time I try to hace bfast here."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2020-01-11,4,"This is such a cute little place! My mom and I stopped in to have a quick bite today in between activities. It's a busy bakery with lovely window displays, and a lovely sit down table service area in the back where we ate. They were serving brunch so I got the Nutella waffle, she got the salmon eggs Benedict. My meal was delicious and perfectly balanced with both a fruit and chocolate flavor, and my mom liked hers as well! Friendly staff and quieter atmosphere."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2020-01-09,5,"I kid you not when I say this....Maison Kayser is absolutely astonishing!!! Words cannot describe my love for this place. We visited New York City and stumbled upon this cafe! We walked a total of 2 hours from our hotel and back to get to this cafe TWICE during our trip. TWICE. The Chocolate Almond Croissant is to die for-so delicious and fresh. The brownies and cookies are baked to perfection and melt in your mouth. The Iced Chocolate tastes like heaven and the Hot Chocolate is just as (if not more) delicious. The place has an amazing atmosphere and great customer service! If you're looking for a cozy atmosphere with absolutely terrific baked goods and treats, look no further. You'll feel like you're in Paris, no doubt. Will definitely visit this place over and over again."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2020-01-06,3,"This is a busy place ! It's like an extremely fancy Panera with a few waited  tables. The menu for the waited tables is also fancy. You have to walk through the crazy crowded take out space to get to the tables though. As busy as they are though, they found time to create a nice fruit bowl for our son. My husband and I both got pastries. I got the sweet brioche. It was pretty good. 

The tables are packed together. We met a really nice couple from South Carolina. I like being in new places with crowded spaces to make conversation with interesting people. 

I think it might be an over rated place but it's worth coming in at least once :)"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2020-01-01,4,"Just saw this spot while walking by at around 3pm and decided to duck in for a quick lite bite before our late dinner plans. There was no wait for the tine we were here. I ordered the coffee which was delicious and she ordered a salad which she said was one of the best shes ever had. I gave it 3 stars simply for the service. While friendly overall, it was not timely. Waiting over 40 minutes in a 3/4 full space is to long. Nothing needed cooked just prepared. The salad was also served without the dressing and had to be asked for. Additionally my coffee during this long wait was empty for 15-20 minutes and i had to chase someone down to get a refill. Overall excellent food and drinks but would choose somewhere else based on service time.

**disclaimer just before we left we were offered unprompted items from the bakery so i raised it to 4 stars!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-12-09,5,"First time here, loved our experience! We both ordered  breakfast items to share, and the food was delicious. Customer service was excellent!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-11-11,4,"I don't know about all these reviews but I still love this place. 

Clean ambience and great pastries. My only regret is buying the white chocolate vien that didn't have white chocolate cream inside as I expected.. I should have gotten the pain a chocolat! So upsetting! But I went in the morning and they had some samples of mango and strawberry cake which was so good!! 

I always get a chocolate croissant for my sister here :) I love it! This place reminds me of Paris!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-11-05,1,"We visited MK for a tea break on a weekday afternoon. We ordered a few cups of yogurt with price tag at $6.95 at entrance, but end up paying $8.95 each. We were told the extra charge was because we ate in the restaurant. But we were neither informed of the extra charge when ordering, nor was the restaurant staff able to show us the charge on menu when I asked. And I am not aware of any other restaurants in the city will charge 28+% service fee without informing customers.

To Valerie: The cups of yogurt we had were exactly the to-go version. I even compared the cap size -- they were served with the same plastic cups. I got the same answer when I challenged the bill, because the manager thought our yoghurt were served in plate at beginning. Then he realized we actually had the to-go cups, and told me the charge was simply because we ate in the restaurant."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-10-31,4,This is a clean friendly bakery. Every pastry we bought in the was very good. The coffee is excellent.
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-10-14,1,"Go there every day  and last night I arrived at 9.58PM precisely when the store shuts at 10 PM I was brushed off so Rudely! The staff looks like they ve been recruited on Rykers Island: Rude , Vulgar, Disrespectful . A customer is the one that feeds you guys every day and deserves RESPECT ! AVOID THAT STORE!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-09-22,5,"Sacré bleu! 

Sixteen Manhattan locations and over 100 shops world wide in over 20 countries.

Their menu boasts dozens of gorgeous looking French breads, rolls, loaves, croissants, pastries, cakes, tarts, cookies, brownies, madeleines, and ""grab and go"" sandwiches and salads.  They also have a sit-down café for a leisurely breakfast, lunch or dinner.

We stopped in for a snack during our Manhattan wanderings and grabbed two seats at one of their counters to enjoy a ham and cheese croissant ($6.25), a chocolate croissant ($3.75) and split a bottle of Perrier ($2.50).

My ham and cheese croissant was spectacular! Absolutely five stars on the deliciousness scale. It was cheesy, flaky, savory, and came with a lot of ham. And it was big too. 

I left very impressed after my first trip to the House of Kaiser."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-09-11,1,"What an insult!!! We had breakfast at maison kayser, which was good, the bread is fantastic. BUT getting the credit card bill and they took more tip than we signed for!!!! What an effrontery!!! I cant belive it! You would imagine such a highly proffessional bakery to do better than that."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-08-14,4,"Chocochip cookie on point, coffee descent. All in all a good trip to Maison Kayser. My review is short because that's how my trip there was."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-07-23,3,"Much as I have always loved this bakery, and especially the one in Paris near the Luxembourg Gardens , quality seems to be waning here in NYC. Just had the apple tart which was basically inedible and they won't make you an iced espresso for fear customers will use too much milk without paying for a latte or cappuccino. I literally only like two drops of  milk and wasn't permitted to buy an iced espresso to customize my drink.  Really?"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-07-17,3,"I got a cake from this place for a rushed birthday surprise but thankfully they managed. they also allow us to order in the morning and save it for us to take it later in the afternoon. I didn't sit here or anything, literally just went there to grab the order and go. however I can tell by the short experience of just walking in and taking the order that the ambience of the place is pretty nice and it might be one of those places people would love to spend a quick lunch break at. the store was clean, spacious, comfortable, and everything was displayed well. 

we got the Mango Blackcurrant Cake, which is 3 layer mousse cake with a thin dense sponge as the base, Blackcurrent mouse in the middle, and mango mousse on top. the top part was also decorated with macarons and bits of white chocolate. I think the cake looks really pretty. apparently it tastes pretty good too. not too sweet, quite light despite of it being a mousse cake, hence pretty easy to eat and it doesn't leave some bad weird after taste

yes, I've definitely had better cakes somewhere but overall this place is not bad at all"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-06-28,4,"Have been here on two occasions. Overall solid, and nice presentation.

Coffee is nothing special, it's okay but like not the smoothest taste for the cappuccino.

Got the raspberry tart the first time. Tart itself was okay, but the raspberries tasted actually surprisingly fresh and flavourful. Wasn't overly sweet but enough to enjoy.

Apple tart and chocolate twirl (I forgot their name for it) the second time. The tart was very soggy and the apples were okay. Presentation was A class but taste didn't live up to it, so was kinda disappointing. Chocolate twirl was nice and flaky, with a very strong chocolate taste that also was a good mix. Would definitely advice getting this, if I remember what they are actually called.

So basically, I really like this location but only the Apple tart was a little disappointing."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-06-15,4,"Initially their cappuccino felt like a latte. Too much milk instead of foam. But when I asked the barista to fix it, he did fix it."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-06-08,5,"First off, the food was tasty...great sandwiches, French pastries, and great pasta salads! More importantly was the customer service. We came in 20 minutes til closing after a long day of adventure. Although they had cleaning and close up to attend to, Nicole and William dropped everything and were so helpful. They even fired up the oven after it was closed down for the night to warm our sandwiches. They joked around with us and were so pleasant at the end of their shift! We'll be back sure!!!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-06-07,3,"Food: 4 stars
Service: 3 stars
The reason why the food is not 5 is because their pastries and cakes are sometimes still frozen and are not ready to be sold. 
Also, in the restaurant section, the food quality differ every time I go. Not consistent. 
Service is poor. They are slow. Seriously slow. If you go in in the morning, sometimes, the line for waiting for cashier and drinks are very long. I don't know if they are short handed or they don't allocate enough staff at those section but slow. Not all but some of them are not friendly. Mean and mad because they are busy. I don't think they have right customer service education to employees. 
I love their croissants but there are many things to improve in this store."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-05-31,4,They make pastries so flakey and light just like in Paris. Above average price tag but i chalk it up to Manhattan real estate. I come every time I'm in the city. One day i will try the savory food andnupdate my review.
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-05-31,4,"Maison Kayser is one of my favorite spots in the city! All the locations feel like a little piece of Paris right in NYC! Today, I went to this 6th Ave location for the first time. It is a little on the small side, but we were able to get a table no problem!

I ordered the iced cappuccino and salmon fume. The cappuccino was good, but it took a very long time to arrive. I had to ask the server to bring it two times and it did not come until after our food arrived. I thought that this was not acceptable and the drink should have been comped. 

However, I did really enjoy the salmon fume! It is a piece of toast with cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, onions, and a sunny side up egg. It was very flavorful and filled me up the perfect amount. If you are looking for a bigger breakfast, this is definitely on the smaller side. I like to eat light in the morning so it was perfect for me!

The server really let us sit at the table for a while after we were done. I appreciated not feeling rushed! Overall, we had a nice time here, I just wish that the service was better when bringing the drinks out."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-05-19,2,"Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience due to poor customer service / a rude staff member.  I gave two stars because the coffee and pastry we ordered were good. However, I don't think I will go back to this particular Maison Kayser because of the service we experienced."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-05-15,5,"Near Central Park NY, NY.

Great pastries. Coffee was surprisingly good.

We had the Apple Tart and a Chocolate Pecan goodie.

The drip coffee was excellent.  The Latte was perfectly balanced.

Good place for a simple breakfast."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-05-15,5,"I've only bought breads, as well as a few of their take-out sandwiches and salads. The salads are a bit pricey, the sandwiches not quite as much to my eye, but everything is delicious. Their Monge baguette could be the single best bread anywhere this side of Paris! The counter servers are all very helpful, and every one of them is friendly and warm. Overall a great place to stop in!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-05-12,4,"Delicious, friendly service, great americanos, and patisserie items. I come here often and am never disappointed.

Kema did a magnificent job of managing the Saturday morning crush, and our party enjoyed everything from soft-boiled eggs and avocado toast to sweet sausages and eggs. The robust coffees were each delivered with a petite pastry by courteous servers. I highly recommend this establishment! Arrive before 8:30 am to beat the breakfast rush."

They used to have way more things. What is happening to them?"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-03-07,5,The almond croissants here are some of the best I've had! Sometimes they have little samples of some of the items they sell out by the register. I once tried a financier that way and ended up loving it.

141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-02-01,3,"Our party of 4 topped in for a quick pastry fix before hitting up a show at Carnegie Hall. Walked into a nice, open, & bright spot and waited our turn to order something. Once the few patrons in front of us decided on what they wanted and move along, we took a gander at the offerings on display. Honestly, the selection wasn't that impressive and shelves weren't that full at around 6:00pm on a Saturday. I had a double chocolate cookie and coffee. The cookie was dry and didn't really wow me with the taste either. The coffee was decent but they didn't have any milk out for self service. When I asked the barista for some, he quietly brought over a container to pour it from but he was hardly enthused. Two of us grabbed a seat at a wall-facing table and the area was not clean - crumbs everywhere. The other 2 slid into some seats by the entrance. We quickly downed our items and left. 

As for seating, there is not much up front - just a few seats by the entrance and window which faces the Avenue of the Americas. There are a few tables at the back as well (which were all occupied when we were there). There is another spot for 3 facing the wall across from the coffee bar."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-01-12,5,"Maison Kayser at the 57th street location caters more to tourist so it's a different kind of vibe. I have been to the once near grand central and they are much better.

The reason I gave it a 5 star was for the service the people here are super helpful and that makes the experience overall better."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-01-11,2,Could the tables be smaller or closer together? They are so small their plates and coffee don't fit  service is surly and unprofessional but maybe it's the faux French barmen suits they have to wear. The old stand by of PDQ is much better and better value!
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2019-01-06,1,"If I could give zero stars I would!
Disgusting on all counts from the shoddy food that emerged from kitchen to waiter who behaved like a total thug to the so called manager who clearly does not know the first thing about management or customer service!
Shame on Eric Kayser for starting out so well and allowing such a disgrace to take place!
The manager never apologized and basically laughed at us! 
When a few of us approached the manager about him not helping us or him NEVER apologizing to us, he just smiled and wished us a nice day! That is obviously the kind of man Eric Kayser likes and employs! I would also imagine all the executives emulate this type of behavior! 
And from what I have heard and read some woman named Valerie M may come back to me apologizing and wanting more details but of course nothing will be done!
To all reading the review, my friends and I frequented Maison Kayser when it first opened in New York years ago and it was good. Now after several visits, it is clearly a badly run, sorry excuse of bad French food and repulsive American service of which no-one at the company cares! Shame on you Eric Kayser ! Shame on what you started out to be and what you are now!
If I sound hysterical and emotional  it is because I am so upset at this restaurant and the way they treated us!
To all visitors to Manhattan, who either have or expect a higher standard of service and product, take advantage that Manhattan has a lot to offer and seek out these better places where the owners and executives actually care about what they cook, bake and how they manage their stores and restaurants and they are out there!

It is positively sickening what we encountered and that it is allowed and condoned and will never be rectified.

Update to review;
Got a message from Valerie M. The same standard message on all their many bad reviews. Did what she suggested and guess what? Not a single response! The folks at Maison Kayser are merely laughing at us fools who support their business!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-12-27,4,"Great place for breakfast with the family on vacation.    Very tight tables, but it works - don't be afraid.   Good portions for breakfast, lasted all day"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-11-30,5,Fabulous desserts.  The pistachio cookies and the caramel eclairs are to die for!! The coffee bar is quite excellent as well. Great place to warm up and treat yourself.
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-11-30,4,"I've always been a fan of a little more crunch with my pastries and the almond croissant at this quick, quaint, and easy bakery didn't let me down. 

An almond croissant was behind the glass case calling my name. The edges were crossed just perfectly and the inside was the perfect ooey-gooey consistency. 

The bakery staff was super kind and welcoming and even offered lunch items, too. Just down the street from our hotel on 6th Avenue, I can't wait to make this my daily morning stop whenever I have the fortune to visit NYC!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-11-01,5,"Perfect for a ladies brunch! Found this spot with my mom when we were planning on Buvette, but the wait was insane. Stumbled upon this gem next door with no wait and it hit the spot perfectly! From the front, it just looks like a take-out bakery, which is why I never had realized I could eat there before (I lived in the area and walked right by every day). 
Food - delicious, fresh, French. Had croissants, bowl of berries and split a fluffy omelet. Ordered a pot of tea. 
Service was fast and prices good. 
Atmosphere - bright and airy, open space. Bustling cafe."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-10-24,1,"Cold coffee, inattentive & surly staff. Actually they deserve a zero. I took a good look around because I'll never see the inside of the store again"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-10-21,4,"The pastry was quite good and I really liked my little blueberry chia pudding. Beware, though--if you grab a to go sandwich, the bread is ""hard enough to be a weapon,"" says my mom."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-10-06,5,"We stopped by here for breakfast before going to Central Park. It was amazing!! I had the croque madam and my husband had a baguette with lox, capers and onions. I also had the creamiest chai latte and ordered an almond croissant to enjoy in the Park later. It was the best almond croissant I've ever had!! Highly recommended!!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-09-28,2,"The entire staff is rude. The place needs to be cleaned.
They wouldn't let us sit in the dining area because we just bought coffee and cake and the couples in front of us were seated in the dining area! 
The bathroom is a disaster!
For their prices, one would think they can afford some manners and cleaning products!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-09-12,1,"I come to get salad each day for lunch and noticed the amount of salad dressing in the small container was getting less and less.   I took two containers today due to the small amount and the cashier lady charged me extra.  When I told her the dressing was not enough, she was rude and responded that she knew that.  Unacceptable attitude. It is never good to cut corners.  Not coming back. Too bad a reputable place like Kayser is resorting to this gimmick."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-08-29,5,"Really great customer service here. I usually come here just to buy a fresh baguette, and they are always willing to give me a half baguette if that's all I need. This morning, I forgot to bring the bread for my sandwich for lunch, and I asked them if they could give me two slices. The people there were kind enough to accommodate me (even though they usually don't sell single slices) and they even made it on the house. I will definitely keep coming to this location for all my bread needs!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-08-25,4,"Ordered a white chocolate venisoisse bun and a mocha cake. Overpriced but tasty. The bun was similar to a Panera cinnamon crunch bagel, but 6 times the price, so I probably wouldn't order it again."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-08-07,4,"One of the best Croissants I have ever had in the United States. I was in New York for a business trip next to Hilton midtown and this place was one block away. Almond Croissant, Chocolate Almond Croissant, and Pain Raisin were all top quality. Will have to try Maison Kayser in downtown DC, next time."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-08-04,5,This is the best croissant in my life! Beautiful and delicious assortment. Nice atmosphere. Fast service. I really recommend to try almond croissant or chocolate)
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-08-03,5,"Had the croque madame for breakfast. Food and service were exemplary. The room was crowded, but it isn't Manhattan, Kansas, is it. We thought we got excellent value, and would happily return the next time we are in the big city."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-07-15,5,"High quality, delicious food every time! I wish they would expand in Florida! I took my wife and daughter there and they loved it! The breakfast menu is creative which makes deciding difficult! I will make it a point to stop in every time I'm in the city!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-07-13,4,"I love coming here before going to work early in the morning !! I'm not much of a ""chain coffee shop or restaurants""  person however, if your looking for total FRESHNESS this is a great spot! Everything is super tasty specially the bread, pastry/sweets & Coffee 
Highly recommend it for those of you who like to eat fresh!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-06-11,5,"Love this place for breakfast and if I want something sweet! They also have really good coffee! Their variety of pastries are awsome! I always get their almond croissant and chocolate croissant. The pastry is flaky, but not too flaky and the chocolate is not so sweet! The almond paste is just darn good! Gets really busy, but everyone is really nice. You can sit there and have a yummy breakfast,  brunch or lunch or togo! Place smells soo good cause they are always baking and you can see them baking!"

Great option for a truly legit croissant -- proper crox, if you will.  Not that huge fan of the other stuff (good, but not like that crox)."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-06-03,2,"Kayser has good sandwiches and croissants. But if you are looking for good service, I would recommend walking away. This place has one of the worst service standards in the city. The few times we have stopped by for a dine-in, it has always taken over 20 minutes to even get a menu card. And of course it takes servers a while to even notice you are looking for service or to place an order. Save yourself a few hours and just pick up and go rather than dine-in."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-05-04,3,"I have visited 4 times so far and have had the following for lunch (to go only):

- Broccoli focaccia (twice, usually it is delicious but was a tad too greasy the last time)  
- Half egg salad / avocado sandwich ( $4 for a tiny half sandwich)  and 
- Mini mozzarella / pesto sandwich (tasty, I don't remember the price)  
- My Fiance and I came here for just coffee once and it was decent.

Service is usually pretty friendly.  Sorry to read that some people are being mistreated here.
I was wondering about the seating (see the other reviews) but I didn't ask since my orders are always to go.  
Regarding the other reviews it is interesting to read the other reviews about the seating and very expensive breakfast sandwich.
Overall it is a little overpriced (and I am not as price sensitive as most)  but the portions are just right (not too much food) , there isn't a lot of simple vegetarian food in the area except for Pret. Across the street the Fresh & Co. sandwiches are too large.
With the prices they charge they should offer seating to all paying customers in my opinion.  I think they need to work out the kinks regarding price, seating and customer service.  But worth a visit if you don't mind spending a little more and due to limited options in the area."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-05-01,2,"Maison Kayser has great pastries. I haven't tried the food and if/when I do, it won't be from this location (I'll explain). The pastries are lovely to look at and mmm MMMM to eat! If you find a spot with great food and great service, count your blessings. For me, this spot ain't it. Food's great, but...

Customer service depends on who ya get. My first few times going in, I was helped by one of the gentlemen and they were welcoming and friendly and professional. There is one lady who's also great. Howeverrrrr, last week I'd gone in to get my beloved pain au raisin (I LOVE that thing!) The greeter gave me the nastiest look, lol! A look I haven't seen since junior high! When folks do stuff like that, I just assume they're dealing with some personal mess and I keep it moving. Usually when I'm in there, I see the same woman greeter cheesing it up for...certain customers. I went in again this morning and there was another black woman in front of me as I entered. The greeter (also a black female as is the gas faced cashier who I'll mention in just a few more sentences) all but ignored both of us. Hmm... So, I ask for my pain au raisin in my crappy French and the nice lady behind the counter hooks me up with my pastry and a smile. So she's smiling and I'm smiling...we're all smiles, it's all good. I go to the smiling cashier and he gives my purchase to the girl at the register next to his and directs me (with a smile) to her. So still smiling, I go to her. Why's she rockin' the gas face? Anywho, she asks if that's all and I say yes. She takes my dough, gives me my change, slides my pastry toward me and wishes me a good day...like she's disgusted, lol. Whatever issues her and the greeter are going through, I hope they're sorted out soon cos, ugh, they've just lost this Maison Kayser a customer. The pastries are one thing but I ain't payin' for no one's nasty attitude."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-04-05,2,"We wanted to take a break from walking and try some good coffee and a treat. The treats were wonderful, but the coffee was just sub par. The worst part was that we weren't told if we ordered at the counter we wouldn't be able to sit at a table. So much for taking a break. It ended up being a $30 tab for 2 desserts and 4 basic small drinks (coffee and hot cocoa) and we couldn't even rest our legs."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-04-01,1,"Wow - horrible customer service and experience.  The hostess implied that I couldn't afford sitting in the back ""you can sit in the back but it's expensive"" who says that? The pastry I tried was amazing, something with mango (my boyfriend and I only wanted a pastry and coffee) but I can't believe the comment she made and how un-welcoming the staff was. 
Was it because I was wearing a beanie? Did I look homeless? Trust me when I say I did not look homeless, I easily make more money than them but regardless, Homeless or not, you don't treat people that way. Being French and owning a French bakery in NY doesn't put you above everyone else."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-03-30,1,"Horrible service. Will not go there again. 

The sit down area is extremely cramped. It was made worse by squeezing tables well into the passage way. They are painfully slow in clearing the tables, which exasperated the problem. While we were waiting for a table to be cleared, another two guests strolled in, walked around us, and sat down at the available table right in front of us.  The manager, instead of clearing the confusion, spoke to us in a way demonstrated extremely lack of manner.  I lived in New York City for over twenty years. That was rude even for New Yorkers. 


There are plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood. The other Maison Kayser two blocks away at Columbus Circle offers much more pleasant experience.   Take your business somewhere else. It is not worth the pain. 

The place is fine for buying bakery goods to go."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-03-19,4,Great spot to grab coffee and a croissant for the morning! It's accessible by subway (F train) and has decent seating availability. They have a broad selection of pastries and coffee as well as sandwiches for those who are looking for more than a quick bite! Pricing is reasonable to Starbucks and this place a new innovative menu for customers to try.
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-03-16,5,We really enjoyed breakfast here. The waitstaff were courteous and the food was great.  Love bed the ham and cheese sandwich
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-03-06,5,"I really couldn't have picked a better place to try french onion soup for the first time - Maison Kayser presents it beautifully and the taste was amazing. Although this is currently my favorite here, this bakery chain has amazing desserts as well. One I recommend is the Adagio!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-02-24,4,I tried for the first time the French bechamel sauce with poached eggs inside and topped with smoke salmon and it was amazing. I was in love but then i knew I had to pay for it afterwards (because I am lactose intolerant and the sauce was mainly made with milk and heavy cream). Oh well it was worth a try. Definitely love to come back here again to try other bakeries goods and coffee.
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-02-03,1,"Overpriced food. Had cold scrambled eggs, cold ham (small portion for he price) with ""meh"" service. Their pastries are beautiful (though I didn't have any)--will never go back to sit down and eat."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-02-03,5,"A great little place for breakfast. Service is attentive and the food is delicious and portions are larger than they appear. 

Had the cocotte, pain perdu, and a few other bites."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-02-01,4,"Had the mini pecan white choc vennoise. Essentially airy sour dough bread with an amazing sugary crust and studded with pecans. And this almond croissant like pastry they cut up for samples. Just love the options.

If you find yourself having a hard time deciding between an almond croissant or chocolate pan, plain crusty French bread or a decadent mousse. Or jus a dam coffee as you mull over the 2 dozen options and get mesmerized by the butter fumes, this is the spot for you. I relish the options like a kid in a candy store in awe, all the time."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-01-31,1,What a waste of time and money this place is a mess. I don't know if the decent  reviews are for another location? I went in after reading a review about a freshly scrambled egg on a soft roll to go. I asked if I could order any breakfast sandwich to go... they looked at me like I was crazy. the eat in cafe was crowded so I didn't want to sit down especially when I saw the egg sandwich was 18 bucks I finally just got an almond croissant to get out of there. Then I asked about coffee she said I had to order it over at the other counter. completely ridiculous. So I skipped that and headed across the street to Starbucks where I could count on the coffee and service. figured I would at least enjoy my croissant...umm no.  it is hard as a rock seems a little burnt and inside the feeling is hard and pretty tasteless so disappointing will not recommend to anyone. Oh they also act like they are doing you a favor by talking to you
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-01-27,5,"The food was very good, and incredibly reasonable prices for the portions. They were able to sit a table of 9 with no wait at 8:30 am. They have the option to sit down, which we did, or just get something from the front. The staff was pleasant and accommodating, I would come back here again."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-01-24,3,"Just left this location and I'm honestly upset with myself for not going to my usual store at Columbus Circle.
My order was simple... a bunch of grab and go sandwich items since the salad I normally go with was out of stock. I also asked for a baguette Monge- sliced. I was going back to my job and didn't have anything on hand there to cut the bread. From the sluggish attitude I received from the cashier to the visibly upset counter staff who refused to slice the bread and simply moved on to take another order I could tell this place is lacking motivated employees. The counter supervisor in the orange shirt came in shortly after and sliced the bread. This is a seemingly small issue but having worked for the chain as a counter staff myself I know that while slicing bread is tedious, it is not a hard nor time consuming task. Place the bread, press the button and bag the bread... so im wondering why this employee thought it ok to skip my order. 
Though I will say, the bread from all locations is delicious no matter the staff"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-01-21,1,"bought
2 cookie. obviously wasn't fresh at all
hard like a rock
very disappointed for a $3.25 cookie!
they should have a better turn over on their product.
at this price it's really a shame
second time that this happened to me, and in a different locations"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-01-19,1,"I just could not let this go.  I get in later to Manhattan--last night--check-in and want something good for takeout. I walk to the bank and notice the restaurant. I enter Maison to get dinner ( more than an hour to close)--but there was a group of the staff just hanging out at what seemed to be a checkout-counter for Togo orders or the like. I don't interrupt but am standing there a good 5-7 mins--I get MYSELF a menu and just peruse. No one says a word at that counter!! A young lady comes from the back near the pastries and inquires if I'd like to order out. I chose on the menu what seems to only be offered if you sit down-- but I'm exhausted and really have no desire. But she grabs a waiter and I decide to take a seat to have that meal.
Little to I know, BAD DECISION! 
Nearly everything I asked about I was able to have for some reason but decided to get an endive  salad Which was poorly made and unbalanced-- I just requested more of toppings and did the best I could with what was there. I was too tired to send anything back again and again. Because it was taking longer for me to eat the salad I was asked if I would like to hold off on the pasta coming out and I said yes--and then it came out! Maybe if you told the kitchen instead of sort of ignoring my presence, I would've been able to have pasta after my salad instead of together -- the flavors totally didn't mesh.   So the pasta comes out and looks dryer than the desert air is in SoCal, it tasted that way too. It was really difficult to eat seeing as if I just left Cambridge eating some of the best pasta I've ever had at Carmelina's--Which also had impeccable service. I ate a few bites and completely lost my appetite after I happened to see the Server dig in his butt or more or less a scratch I'm not sure--either way it's disgusting I just requested to go containers and the check. I had to choose the desert and he went through a few but when I chose I saw him pull it behind some things on another counter and I was not going to eat something that have been exposed to air for quite some time I'm sure just to Rid of it. So I just decided to get a basic brownie. He came back with the brownie and picked up the check and brought it back to be signed--something told me to check the brownie and so I did when I open the bag there was a feathery something in the bag with my brownie and I decided to ask if it could be replaced. Mind you before he responds, he looks down to see what the tip was on the check.He had the nerve to assume that he even deserved a tip after the service I had had and luckily I had set the pen in a way that interrupted that view.  I just decided to grab my things and go to the front after that.
I do sincerely believe that the server didn't change my dessert which was included in my purchase--I feel like he just change the bag and was surprised when I was coming from the back with my coat and remainder of food.

I was so DONE after that!  I could've spent that same money at Scarpetta and actually had good food and amazing service or had even gone to the local chain boulangerie.

Having used a  coupon wouldn't make this visit better or make me feel better about what was spent in this place. By the way, guys listen vegetarians and vegans and pescatarians are very different--Google it."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2018-01-13,3,"Saturday brunch. The place is incredibly busy most likely due to the wonderful bakery on premesis. The locals obviously like this place.

We waited about five minutes before our table was ready. The place is cozy and tables are tight like a French bistro but on Sixth Ave NY.

We ordered an avocado and salmon dish. Both were great. We also got the assorted breads as we could not resist.  They were delicious. Service was prompt, cheerful and efficient. Value was excellent. 

We would return when back in the City.

Mark."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-12-26,3,"I generally love Maison Kayser, but this location is the least favourite one I've been to:/. The one near Bryant Park has SO much room for people getting pastries and coffee to eat but this one has 2 two-tops & a small bar for three. Very inconvenient in the winter months. Food was delish as usual though. Got an apple tart, almond croissant & apricot pistachio tart (pictured) always delish :)"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-12-11,3,"These restaurants are popping up all over New York City in Manhattan.  On a chilly night with showers, we were looking for a place to get a nice dinner.  She has heard of these restaurants so we decided to try it.   It is also a pastry shop and you walk past the pastry counter when you are being seated for dinner.   It wasn't too crowded and we were seated right away.  The service left something to be desired as we had to ask for water multiple times as well as an ordered beverage.  Both of us had the seasonal (pumpkin) soup which was good.  I also had the salad that with chicken and avocado that had cucumbers, cilantro, and a sauce.  It was okay.   The service was really poor given we had to continually ask for something.  Our male waiter was very attentive to two young women at a table near us but we didn't have the same service.  It's just ok for a meal.  We didn't try the pastries but they do look very tempting and that may be what people like the most about these places."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-12-03,3,"I am a huuuuuuuge fan of Eric Kayser and support the success of his U.S. stores (despite one location's replacing The Harrison--a wonderful restaurant in Tribeca--RIP). Kayer's are the consummate croissants; his fresh, pillowy, fluted dark chocolate madeleines are the stuff Proustian daydreams are made of and can be accompanied by, e.g., a lovely cup of fresh mint tea from Palais des Thés, smooth cold brew, or decadent chocolat chaud; and his baguettes--in the form of loaves or encasements of wonderful toppings (fresh mozzarella, brie and green apples, poulet crudites) in the made-fresh-daily sandwiches--baguette about it. 

It therefore pains me to have to leave a three-star review, but for this location, I simply must, on account of some of its surly, lackadaisical, unfriendly employees. There are indeed hard-working, eager-to-please, efficient employees here--the baristas and servers behind the pastry counter, especially--but they are far out numbered by the bad apples. Many of the cashiers cannot be bothered to provide a bag for the pastries unless asked; others hover over customers' selecting items from the refrigerated section, putting sandwiches back in order barely before one is selected/aggressively blocking off access to half the case/asking people who aren't done selecting their items to move out of the way, etc.; and in at least one instance, a barista chose the precise moment to hang a ""this register is closed sign"" smack in front of a customer who had just walked up to order. There is often logjam and a lack of order around where lines form, and checking out could stand to be far more efficient in general.

I will continue to patronize Maison Kayser because I support the master pâtissier, the quality of whose goods outweighs the severe shortcomings in the service of those in his employ. Perhaps the rapid colonization of this mini-empire, about which I'm ambivalent, will soon bring another branch with better service that I can patronize instead."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-12-02,4,"This is a great spot. I've only been once, but I loved it. The service was great, the options were solid, and the atmosphere was really nice. I'd go back."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-12-01,5,Stopped in for a quick snack. He Bressane was delicious and the hot chocolate was too. The Eclair Pistache and Black Tea was to die for!
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-11-30,5,"First off - the coffee is delicious!!!  It's worth the cost and the food is yummy too.  Friendly staff, clean tables and chairs.  The bathrooms are pretty with a Paris theme as well as the café.  Great place to sit and chat or on your own.  Cheers!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-11-27,3,"Was craving sweets after work & decided to try MK out. Ive seen them all over the city. 
I walked to the refrigerated pastries as soon as i walked in and asked the server what the best seller were and his favorite. 
He said the adagio (dark chocolate and passion fruit mousse) sold well.
 I ordered one and I wanted a chocolate chip cookie. He started picking the double chocolate chip and I wanted the macadamia & chocolate chip instead. BIG MISTAKE! That cookie was staaaallllleeeee af! 
But, the mousse. Oh baby, but THE MOUSSE! Was delightful. Would have ever thought dark chocolate and passion fruit paired so well? Not I! I'd definitely go to any of the locations for that treat and try something new too. Stay away from the stale ass cookies doe."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-11-19,4,"We were headed for a long walk to the Empire State Building and looking for a pastry and some coffee.  We saw this place and figured we would give it a try.  The person at the bakery counter was incredible.  We asked here what her favorite was and went with her recommendation.  It was a flat long croissant with pastry creme inside.  It was really good.  I also good a doughball with cream cheese which was pretty good.  Go with the local recommendation.  My wife went and got our coffees and the baristas were acted as if they were artists and they knew it.  Not a big deal as both the cappuccinos were respectable, but nothing exceptional.  The atmosphere provided a nice break from our walk.  We would go back to this location or any other.  Marked down one for the attitude, but worth it."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-10-30,4,"Stumbled upon this bakery on a cold and rainy Monday morning. Loved the overall coziness once you walk through the door! 

Had a chocolate croissant which was good and a cappuccino to go. I'd only say that the separate pastry and coffee bars are confusing - Had to pay separately. Though the lines move pretty quickly."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-10-29,5,"This is how a proper breakfast is done! We expected, and received outstanding service from the minute we arrived to our departure. The restaurant staff was knowledgeable and friendly, so too was the bakery staff despite the large crowd. 

The food was prepared to perfection and we had a wonderful experience at a very reasonable price."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-10-23,3,"The coffee and pastries are awesome. Breakfast very good. Lunch, not so much. The wait person asked me how I like my salmon that I adding to the salad I ordered. I said medium rare, ""I don't like it over cooked."" It came out breaded and fried. And the Cream of Mushroom soup basically was Mushroom Gravy. The first thing I tasted was flour. Not good."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-10-22,4,"I'm a sucker for bakeries. Take me somewhere with beautiful pastries and I can't guarantee that I won't fall in love with you within the next 30 seconds. 

Jokes aside the place is so beautiful. They have all their beautiful pastries on display. I didn't get to take pictures because my friend was deciding if she wanted to stay in or leave. They have a small seating section which looked cozy and adorable. One staff member spoke fluent French with my friend while I kinda looked back and forth magically hoping subtitles would pop up out of nowhere lmfao. 

It's Starbucks style when ordering drinks. They call out your name when your drink is ready. They don't add a lid, so you can customize your drink and cover it yourself. My cold brew was really smooth. It's so cute. They have simple sugar and a little container with cubed sugars. Idk about you, but presentation like that really makes a huge difference for customers. I loved it. 

I thought it was delightful. I'm going to see if they have other locations throughout NYC. I want to check them all out."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-10-14,5,"Baguette and butter - pure perfection. 

Quiche Lorraine was quite good

Salad was excellent. 

Presentation is top notch. 

Decor is comfortable and modern, yet still has a French feel. 

Prices are reasonable. Portions are perfect - not too big and not too small. 

A gem!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-10-13,5,"First of all there are way too many negative reviews with reviewers that have 1-10 reviews. That's an automatic red flag in my head that someone or some place (competitor) has it out for these guys and are just posting fake reviews. Yes America, Fake News and Fake Reviews both exist! That along with knucklehead ""elite yelpers"" who know jack shit about good food and it makes for an undeservedly low star rating. Almond croissants are the best in NYC, baguettes and other fresh breads are also very good. Yeah the service at this location could use some help but I'm not going to ding someone for being slow if their product is good. I'll ding them if the service is rude, not slow. Trust me on the almond croissants!"
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-10-05,3,I love the food and the coffee but they seriously need to get it together with the flow of customers and the register situation. I have walked out on a few occasions because I don't think customers with quick purchases from their pre-made case should have to wait on a long line of people ordering from the bakery... especially when they have multiple staff people standing around and open registers.
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-10-03,3,"At first I was skeptical but this place quickly turned my mind and taste buds around to an unknown culture. The taste was stupendous. However, the waiter was not attentive of our table he got  me the milk for my coffee till it was cold. Should management train the waiters better? Yes! Then and only then will it be a 5 Star dinning experience."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-09-26,2,"Review is for the takeout counter ~5pm. The bread/pastries are consistent with all other locations. 

Horrible service - I can't remember the last time I've experienced such bad service in the city. There are 3-4 guys behind the counter. It took a while to get someone to respond AND take my order because there was 1 guy who was asking what I wanted but then didn't move. There were 2 guys who seemed like they did not want to work. I wanted 2 things. When I got to the register, I had to tell the girl that my order was all the way to the left. Is it always this confusing in the evening? 

Also, whatever is in the window is not visible from the inside of the store. How can you order unless you looked intently from the outside? 

Maison Kayser - I'm not the only reviewer complaining about this - please fix this or you will further hurt your brand. You are lucky you have a good reputation and location."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-09-14,3,"This is two totally different places.  During the day it's wonderful and after 6pm it's a nightmare.  I'm talking about the takeout counter.  At night on multiple occasions couldn't get anyone to help.  They abandon the register to do other things.  Stand there 10 minutes and they won't help.  Ask and they'll tell you to keep waiting.  Complained to the night supervisor and he was one of the rudest characters ever. 

During the day I'm there often for takeout.  Wonderful staff, efficient and a real pleasure."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-09-03,5,"Went to chipotle for some food and spotted this place next door. Went in after dinner for dessert and was greeted nicely. When asking about the desserts I was afraid they were going to scoff but they were very helpful. Ordered a mango moose and raspberry tart which were both delicious. They gave us some complimentary treats with our order which was nice. The price was reasonable, each item is about 6 dollars a piece. Go in and take a look, if not to buy .. to admire the treats is more than enough."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-08-23,4,"The food is delicious and high quality. Their Hot Chocolate and Pastries are beyond words delicious. 
My only dissatisfaction and concern was that when I sat down and placed my order, my drink order was changed to Large instead of Small and my pastry got $1 more expensive. 
So I didn't get that part?
I ended up overpaying more than I initially wanted to spend."
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-07-28,2,Definitely not a family bakeries or sandwiches houses for a family... we was park like beast or cows and spend 100$ for sandwiches and pastries i m ok with that because it was really good... but when they told me than the restrooms was out of order it was too much for me... we are french... travelled the world... and was really disappointed...
141,maison-kayser-new-york-29,2017-07-23,3,I've always enjoyed getting a coffee and Croissant over getting Starbucks but this location always finds a way mess your drink up and charge you incorrectly. Going to this location I'd say to stay aware of your receipt.
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2019-08-09,1,"one star because i cant give zero,

your night deli worker was fucking drunk, didn't know how to work apple pay, 

i asked for a hot sandwich and was given a cold one. pastrami ice cold along with cheese that should have been melted. ontop of that, the worker fumbled to hand me my items and was visibly drunk. i pay, he forgets to bag my items and was about to give them to the next person on line."
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2018-07-07,1,"Relieved to find out I am not the only person who found this deli a place to avoid at all costs. Rude, severely overpriced (a packet of instant noodles for $6). There are at least 3 alternatives just around the corner so I advise you go elsewhere."
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2018-05-24,4,"Ask for Pedro. Period. He will take care of you.

This is my usual deli spot and they are affordable. They have always done me right. I order my breakfast sandwiches and deli sandwiches here. Thank you for putting up with my ridiculous orders. 

Salads are good too. Cheers"
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2018-03-27,4,Good for breakfast and lunch but beware of the morning rush. You could get stuck in there for 10-15 minutes I usually order and pick up . Some items A bit pricey but hey it's Manhattan!
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2016-06-23,1,"RUDEST service and overpriced deli. They charged me $3.10 for a dinky pb and j sandwich that barely had any peanut butter in it. The corners of the bread were so dry from the lack of peanut butter. When I called them to ask about their pricing and to inform them that there was barely any pb in my sandwich, they were rude and hung up on me. They offered no apology and were distastefully rude. If Yelp allowed I would give them a negative 5 star rating."
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2015-08-03,1,"Wow. So I walked in and offered ""fiver"" for a sandwich that was $7.50 (Monday 5/3 evening). They agreed, or at least I thought so. When I paid for the sandwich, turned out that there was a misunderstanding over the price. Ok, fine. Misunderstandings happen. Then they refused to refund and then didn't give me my change. I guess if $10 is more important to you than being fair to your customers, here is the lowest review I can give you gents for your lack of ethics and I suggest everyone stays away. I know everyone needs to survive and we all run businesses and all. So you're welcome."
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2014-10-08,1,"Ordered from here on Seamless. Food took more 20 minutes over the estimate. Some pieces of spinach are rotten. Was given balsamic vinaigrette instead of balsamic vinegar. On top of that, the driver who barely spoke a word of English was giving me a hard time about something when I met him at the building entrance. Something about answer the phone, but I answered on the first ring of the first and only call that I received. Avoid this place."
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2014-07-24,4,"The review is for the flowers that are outside of this store. I was super delighted to see that they had varying types of flowers in small bunches so that I could make my own bouquet for the hotel room. I got three different stems and a small vase for about $25. 

As far as the inside goes, I wouldn't know much about but it seemed to have a lot and it was open around 3am which was great for people like me who are walking the streets of New York out of pure jet lag.

-Megan."
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2014-02-13,2,"Though I have shopped here out of convenience in the past, I will not be any longer.  They price gauged their flowers on Mother's Day and Christmas.  They blatantly put a $20 price sticker over the original $7 price sticker.  $20 for dead flowers is ridiculous.  I have gone here for milk and noticed some of their dairy was expired.  The milk they pour into the prepared coffee (hot and iced), I have witnessed it was past the sell by date and I said no thanks."
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2013-10-07,1,"This place exudes RUDE and overpriced, from the minute you walk in. Because it is in the same building as my friend's apartment, we stopped in for a quick snack. After saying hello to the clerk and being completely ignored, we grabbed a small bottle of orange juice and went to the counter..

The clerk at the counter rung up the juice and dryly asked for $6 *per* unmarked bottle and shocked at the price, my friend politely said she did not expect the price to be so high for juice and we put the products back and said ""nevermind, no thanks."" This was not because we could not afford $12 in juice, but because it is a ridiculous price. 

On our way out the door, the same clerk (who btw is not an owner or manager) rudely yelled ""YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR THE PRICE FIRST!"" and in reply my friend let her know we did not expect the prices to be that ridiculous and the clerk kept the aggressive banter going, looking for a fight and insinuating that we were beneath her. Finally, my friend told her she lived upstairs and would not be returning despite the convenient location and we asked her to stop giving us such an attitude. Talk about drama, over nothing!

With her still yapping away, we made our exit and then got the same exact juice for 1/3 of the price right across the street. Avoid this place!"
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2013-09-10,1,"I live a block away so I go to this place a lot, especially in the morning. My problem with this deli is their price inconsistency! I've had many experiences when they gave me a different price on my tuna sandwich and omelet.. but the most recent one was when the Korean lady charged me $6.10 for two bagels with cream cheese! I said, what?? When she saw my reaction, she turned to the Mexican guy (Pedro who's really nice!) and asked, ""how much is the bagel?"" Duhh! Complete turn off.. I'm never gonna set foot on this deli again unless I'm desperate and dying of hunger.."
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2013-05-20,3,I agree that prices are a bit high here but it's a Manhattan deli what did you expect? I have not experienced any rudeness or long waits when I pop in for a snack or a bottle of water.  Haven't tried the Korean food yet but it sounds good.  All in all an adequate deli when I'm in the area and on the go.
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2013-03-27,4,"I visit HK 7-Marketplace basically on a daily basis.  Working in Murray Hill there really is not many places worth writing home to when it comes to picking lunch.  HK is on the corner of 2nd avenue neighboring the usual Subway, McDonalds, and Kool Blue chains.  None of these are lunch worthy for me so one day I popped into this bodega to see if they had any easy mac or chips.  I was surprised they offered a full deli and Korean buffet.  I tried the buffet once, it was cheap and bland so I did not try it again.  Luckily, they offer a great wrap menu and can make you any type of sandwich you ask for.  All are good quality and very filling.Every sandwich comes with a pickle and small bag of lays potato chips.  Add a soda and you have a meal for under 9 dollars!
They take credit cards without a minimum charge, which is unusual for these kind of places, but definitely a plus!  The offer come ""specials"", but they are the same everyday.  I suggest they do a daily featured sandwich or wrap.  This would tempt me to try more than a tuna or roast beef wrap. 

Best Deal: Cheese-steak ""special""- comes with soda and chips for 7 dollars.

Best Find:  Lots of international snacks here regardless of it being a Korean owned business.  I found Hunuta German hazelnut waffers.  They are delicious."
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2013-01-28,3,"For a late night deli, I can't complain. Sure the prices are a bit high, but that is the neighborhood. It is an oasis for late night necessities. You can also never go wrong with Boar's Head cold cuts. I'm lucky because I am nice to the employee who is there ever evening. I suggest you give him a couple bucks because a little gratuity goes a long way.

   During the day they serve Korean food. Rather strange to see it in a deli like this, but pretty unique. Of course, they have your usual snacks and libations. Again, nothing special, but have always treated me well!"
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2012-11-14,4,"I'm not sure what to call this place - their green delivery menu says ""HK 7 Market Place""; yet their blue awning says ""Seven Market Place""  Either way, this corner convenience store/deli is reasonably priced, they offer a great breakfast selection, and the owners are super friendly!

I came in here this morning for a Greek omelet, and for $4.50 was given a nicely packaged omelet, loaded with tomato and feta, and accompanied with home fries and toast.  The omelet selections also come as larger wraps without the sides for $0.50 - $1.00 less if that's your style, or they have a typical bacon egg & cheese sandwich for $3.75.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Greek omelet though!

For lunch, they have a healthy assortment of Boar's Head cold cuts, as well as hold/cold specialties, all of which range from $5.50-$7.50.  Rounding out the lunch offerings is a separate panini menu and chopped salad bar.

Although this was my first visit, there must be a local following - three out of the four people in front of me on line were making quick small talk during their morning purchases.  Even though this is like the 6th deli I've got within a block of my apartment, I'll most likely be back for some more!"
142,seven-marketplace-new-york,2011-04-24,1,"Incredibly rude staff, poor service, and long wait time.  Price gauging on ALL items.

143,starbucks-new-york-396,2020-01-08,1,"I have never been so disrespected at a Starbucks before. I was waiting in line, and when it came my turn to order, the guy making food, NOT the cashier, mumbled something to me. I was like ""huh""? And him and the cashier collectively yelled to my face, annunciating each syllable, ""WHAT WOULD U LIKE"". I was like wtf. Even my friend who was across the room came over and asked me if everything was okay. I am Asian, and I guess they thought I didn't speak English or something, bc they treated the white woman in front of me with the upmost respect and smiled at her all throughout. When she got her food, the guy who yelled at me smiled at her and was like ""have a great day!"", but for me, he was like ""here's your food"". It's 2020. This is bullshit. Starbucks, train your employees."
143,starbucks-new-york-396,2019-08-01,5,"This Starbucks makes its employees and customers feel as though they are at home. I've been working at this Starbucks for the past 3 months and I've developed a close relationship with a couple of the ""regulars"". Yes, there may be times where people mess up orders or give you the wrong thing, but there's never a doubt that the employees won't do everything in their power to go above and beyond for their customers. It's not a perfect world and this Starbucks can get extremely crowded, so service may be a little slow especially if there are a bunch of Frappuccinos being ordered because that is the most time consuming to make. We try our best to fulfill everyone's wants and needs. If you ever my curly headed self behind the counter don't be afraid to say ""hi"", I am extremely friendly, as is the rest of the Starbucks faculty. 
Also, don't be afraid to ask questions if you're unsure of the sizing of cups or you simply want a recommendation for a drink. As always, we try to provide the best service we can and are happy to do so.
If you don't believe me, come in and see for yourself!"

143,starbucks-new-york-396,2017-04-13,1,"I never thought I would ever leave a negative review for Starbucks.  I am a two cups of Starbucks a day customer - at least.  While in the neighborhood, I visited this location and ordered my drink - a tall nonfat cappuccino.  The nasty (in every sense of the word) barista made a latte.  Mistakes happen and not her fault because the nasty ""pregnant"" cashier ordered a latte.  When I told the nasty barista I didn't order a latte, she looked at me like I just punched her grandmother.  Right away with the nasty attitude - I would have to go back to the register and pay the difference.  It was a mistake and since when does a Starbucks barista not make your drink ?  In any event, the nasty cashier makes eye contact with me while helping another customer so I tell her I never ordered a latte.  She proceeds to tell me that she is with another customer - nasty as ever.  This is all happening with the manager, Sean, looking on.  I know his name because I am the one who called to speak to the manager.  He answered the phone and he was also the only male in the store at the time (2 minutes prior to my call).  He did apologize, but why didn't he jump in?  Well, I can probably tell you why - he really doesn't give a f^%k!  Today, was not the day and I was not the one.  I will contact the district manager and hope all your nasty asses get written up because YOU WILL eventually get fired."

So much for having the app an online ordering because you'll still be waiting for your drink and food once you get there. They don't have the inventory they show on the app that says in stock ---which would be useful because I'd go to a different starbs. I work around the corner and this morning they forgot to make my turkey bacon sandwich. Finally made it, got to the office and it was wet and soggy---disgusting. Get it together please."

It's definitely a small and busy stop-in-and-grab-your-drink Starbucks, not somewhere to meet a friend or read a book. The staff is fast and nice (as all customer service teams are if you're nice to them), drinks are priced and made like any other Starbucks. I took off one star because it always had that weird horrible plastic-y smell, but it's fine because I'm never there for more than 10 minutes."

Every time I went there I was giving an attitude from the staff. In one occasion they didn't make my drink right and I was disappointed so I spoke to one of them and the batista was trying to fight me... The staff looks miserable and are very rude to customers. I would not recommend this location to any of my friends and coworkers. If I could give a half or no star at all I would, that's how bad the experience in this place is. I have spoken to other people about this place and I have encountered that they are having the same experience as I did.  DO NOT GO TO THIS STARBUCKS, but if you do! you have been warned!!! 

I stopped going there, and will never return there in the future. You are better off going across the street to the Capital One 360/Peets Coffee &  tea. The staff there is very very friendly and professional."

You would think the same order at the same Starbucks week after week would be fairly consistent, right...? Not really. How much the cup is filled seems to depend on how generous the staff here are feeling. 

It's OK though. This Starbucks location is aight. The lines here aren't awful and there's practically never a line for the bathroom when I need to use it.

Also, I swear the doors in this place were made by dwarves. Why are they so god damn heavy?"

At around 8:30 on a Thurs night it's empty with only one guy using the WiFi and what must be the only outlet in the place. Not the kind of Starbucks to hunker down and be a WiFi hog at. Being the location it's at must get crazy crowded here during morning work hours.

Still, the counter staff was friendly and served up my iced drink quickly and with smiles all around. Even had a half decently clean bathroom that I used on the way out. Average Starbucks, but aren't most of them anyway?"

This is the second and last time I will be writing a complaint about the store at 731 Lexington Ave.  I ordered a breakfast item, paid, and waited for around 10 minutes.  

When one of the baristas noticed I was waiting, she asked me which item I was waiting for.  I told her, then she told me they were out of it.  They did ask if I wanted anything else.  I didn't and they processed a refund.

This is incompetence at its best.   How do you let a customer pay, wait, and THEN tell them you are out of stock?  

Furthermore, I asked for the manager's business card - conveniently, they were out of it.  

I will also be posting this review on yelp and sharing my experience with others.  After the first horrible experience I've had, the mediocre experiences in-between, and this, you've lost a customer."

I'm taking the time to write a Starbucks review because this is really the WORST experience I had at a Starbucks. So really this is just a rant on one certain person who works there.

I would have told this certain barista off if it weren't so busy and I wasn't in the mood to start a commotion especially just after attending Church. It was really hard to love thy neighbor and I tried so hard not to be hatin' during my time here.

The first thing I noticed was the only barista girl amongst the men. That's a good thing. She was trying to get the line moving by being very assertive, asking who was next and taking orders. I was impressed... at first.

I was looking at the sign they put up and I can't see that well. First off, I forgot to tell her what size I wanted and she gave me a condescending attitude as she said ""big, small, large, WHAT do you want?"". Yes it is my fault I forgot but IT IS her job to ask me and I just don't understand her bad attitude. After I ordered my TALL, Caramel Brulee Latte I asked a question about the bogo deal on the sign which I thought referred to the holiday drinks (which was written on the same sign). I asked ""Is there a buy one get one half off on holiday drinks?"" She looked at me like I was stupid. She thinks about it and probably got confused, ask her co-workers and then complains to her co-worker in front of me. IT IS her job to know what's going on and answer my question. Questions exists for a reason and for her to look so appalled that I asked was ridiculous.

When I picked up the drink from her, she asked me, ""Where did you hear of this half off deal?"" in a faux calm demeanor like a wife would ask her cheating husband, ""Where'd you go last night?"". The question she asked was fine but her attitude was not. I told her I saw it on the sign. She told me, as if it was common knowledge, that the half off sign was for the BEADS. I repeated her just to make sure I'm not death as well and she definitely said beads. 

I took a sip of my Caramel Brulee Latte and it wasn't as good as what I have had before at other Starbucks. Maybe it was just my clouded perception at the time that made it unenjoyable. 

This could all be avoided if she had just said ""No, I don't think we have half off today, I can double check but I'm pretty sure we don't have that deal."" I would have been all good with that! I'm generally a laid-back kinda of person and I would have been NOT writing this stupid yelp review to vent out my frustrations. 

There was a helpful girl ahead of me on the line who tried to quickly explain to me what the sign was all about to make it easier for the barista girl but I couldn't hear her over the voices from other people behind me. I overlooked something and okay, maybe it was my incompetence at the time.  So maybe it was the barista's incompetence at the time when she threw that helpful customer's water bottle away when the customer wanted her  to refill it, tell the helpful customer it's okay because it was all clean, pick it up from wherever she threw it into and rinse it off like nothing happened. 

I understand what it's like being on the other side. You might have all these customers asking stupid questions while taking their dear old time while they order. You might have 10 other people waiting on the line looking into space and the person who is next doesn't know that they are next. However, to be a good employee, answer the questions no matter how simple it may seem, be patient and try to be nice. There is no reason to be so stressed out and so rude.

From the bottom of my heart, thanks barista girl, for creating unnecessary drama. Thanks for not spitting into my drink. Better yet, thanks for not pouring cyanide or some poisonous potion that you probably make in your cauldron into my drink. 

Happy new year and I hope you have nice friends to help you take that broom out of your.... Oh nos, that's not nice."

143,starbucks-new-york-396,2011-08-15,5,"This is my ""home"" starbucks. I am a self-admitted addict, and a gold card member. 
 I have become friendly-ish to the staff - and they usually know what my order is. Its usually crowded weekdays, but it moves quickly. Also - they have the soy-milk out, which is important to me. The staff is really nice and the store is clean."
143,starbucks-new-york-396,2011-06-04,3,"For a New York City Starbucks, I must say the service at this location is not up to par with the fast pace city it is located in. 
Step up the speed of service. My  iced double shot venti black eye does give you a burst to get you going in the morning!"
143,starbucks-new-york-396,2010-09-08,4,"I think this is the right Starbucks to review - the one on the adjacent block of H& M?

Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised with their espresso.  I got a doppio to go and it wasn't bitter at all.  It went down just like a good hot cup of coffee.  I also got an Americano to go and THAT was really good also.  I have gotten it again because it was a great cup of coffee - great taste and again, not too bitter."
143,starbucks-new-york-396,2009-09-22,4,"The Bloomberg Building Starbucks serves up a nice cup of joe. It could be just me but I do think this Starbucks is a little more highclass than the one around the corner. The decor is less of the typical green Starbucks and more on the tan/brown side. It feels like you're entering a hotel because the entrance is a huge glass door. The place just feels newer and sleeker than other Starbucks. The service is pretty good too. 

I had about six drinks to order all with specific instructions. They took my order while in line and everything came out perfect. The cashier had a little more trouble ringing me up but overall they were swift and there was less of a wait/line than the one around the corner. I think most people who go to this Starbucks work in the building. It's a little hidden off of the main street.

I was impressed with this Starbucks. They have great service, are relaxed and are very nice. Starbucks either got lucky with really great employees or  they take pride in a higher standard at this location. I wouldn't be surprised if they did. When you're neighbors with Le Cirque and the Mayor could pop in any time, you always wanna be on your toes."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2020-05-23,5,"Get your latte and walk to the city! This location is prime for getting a bit of seattle and if you collect the Starbucks cups like me, this is the place! It's kind of hidden but not! I'm not a fan of Starbucks in general, but I hve to say the staff, the store, location, and collections were perfect!"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2020-03-19,5,What a awesome staff. To be up in Times Square I can imagine it must be really tough to even show any sense of joy but these guys don't miss a beat. From Jacky and choelle I believe her name is....but Everybody there is amazing and It's literally my go to spot when I'm up in Times Square. Thank you guys for always making my starbucks experience nice and sweet.
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2019-11-19,5,"Nice service that I ever have in New York. I went to buy a cup of a large coffee this morning and used my app. The person who took my order did not say anything so I just wait. There is no line but my coffee did not come and I started to look at employees. One employee said, ""May I help you?"". I just said, "" I'm just waiting for my large coffee.""The employee just said ""Oh, sorry"" and he provided me coffee immediately.
I sigh and received coffee and going to leave.
Suddenly, the store manager came and he said ""I am sorry. We supposed to give you coffee right away. Please come back again."" He gave me a free Starbucks card.

I am so sorry about my attitude but your service was great. I am sure going back to your store."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2019-11-13,1,"LOL - shop lifters galore in this FREEZING cold store with slow cashiers and terrible layout with the double line flow disaster.

Only 45 one stars reviews ? Seems to generous for this joke of a Starbucks....once a great company."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2019-09-12,4,The Starbucks wasn't busy and the cashier was nice.  Seating isn't abundant but I was able to get a seat.  Ordered a venti iced green tea and it's what I would expect as it's my normal drink so nothing special.  Place was pretty clean as well.
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2019-08-14,1,It takes 20 mins to get tall pike. There's seems to be many staff members but just 1 of them taking order during peak time of 3 pm. I was about to fall asleep in the line . This is 2nd occurrence in last 1 week and hope the management take some action...
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2019-03-15,2,"Coffee is good, and so is personal service . However; no seats and the choices to eat are as horrible as all Starbucks - croissants, cakes and sweets. Or salads with to small protein servings.
Only back for coffee"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2018-11-14,4,"Typical starbucks. No line when I was there, the guy didn't score up my order. Grabbed a new Been There mug. Grabbed my kid a cake pop. Should have asked for a discount as the penguin had three eyes . No real complaints but nothing over the top here either."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2018-11-09,4,"Slower than molasses in January....
However! Kumba at the register and the barista were SO nice that I was like okay...its okay if its slow. 

Ps. Loads of tourists."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2018-10-23,4,"When I first started working in the building next door, I would ordered here until i waited more than 20 minutes for one drink... so I stopped coming here. This week I just started ordering here again and the service has gotten a lot better! I always order on the app and would have to wait forever for my drinks, these baristas are fast! which is awesome because there's a lot of traffic in this area. Everyone is so nice here and efficient, I will definitely be coming here more often when I need a quick caffeine fix!"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2018-08-13,1,"I worked at this location for about 5 months and I was treated so poorly by the staff and managers. Belittled, always felt that someone was laughing at me instead of training me and teaching me new things. Starbucks itself was enjoyable to work for. Friendly costumers, genuinely enjoyed promoting and testing new beverages. Just disappointed at my experience with co workers and management. Horrible attitudes and a petty work environment. Manager was rude, showed favoritism and all around discourages staff."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2018-07-02,2,"Nice baristas, but extremely under staffed! The service is very slow!!!! Prepare to wait 10 minutes + for a simple iced coffee."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2018-06-13,3,"Visiting on vacation and found this location first day after a lot of sightseeing. It's close to the hotel and we just need a place to rest, drink iced tea, and charge the phones. Very limited seating and hard to find power. Iced green tea was as expected. Store was tidy and clean enough. The staff was find, nothing remarkable, good or bad. This location does have a restroom and best for ""get and go"" orders."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2018-04-18,1,"Ok Establishment. They function like a normal Starbucks. The fall side is that they do not have any bathrooms. Ridiculous right? I decided to count the seats, it appeared they had more than 20 seats which means they are in violation of city health laws. Can Starbucks not count?"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2018-03-17,4,"Warm and cozy place and staffs were friendly.  The place was not too crowded.
It's close to my hotel very convenient."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2017-11-13,3,"This is a normal Starbucks. Staff is neither friendly nor rude. They are reasonably efficient at handling crowds; perversely, it takes longer to get your drink on a slow afternoon. Not much seating and music is loud, so it's not an environment where you want to linger.

I've had slightly better drinks at other locations; they tend to be not hot enough or poorly mixed. Never any drastic mistakes, though."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2017-10-20,1,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE

Starbucks really needs to re-evaluate how they train employees especially with customer service. It's enough that it's NY morning where everyone was in a rush. but the employees were RUDE, like straight up didn't care they were making the wrong drinks. One of the baristas LAUGHED that she messed up on a drink 3x. The only nice person there was the guy at the register. This is the worst Starbucks ever. That says A LOT since all Starbucks in Midtown pretty much suck. I will be just making my own at home. It's cheaper, less time-consuming, and I don't have to deal with your rude-ass employees."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2017-06-25,1,"The worst starbucks !
I came here to buy a mug
And i payed with 100$,, they said my money is too big
For starbucks company ? Big company with a lot of store ,, cant have change for 100$??
The other severe is the cashier dont have effort to find a change!hey... i come for buy not for begged

Then i come to the other store
The cashier has effort for give me a change from 100$!
I appreciated him 

WTH"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2016-12-14,1,Probably the worst in the city. Takes them forever to give me a black coffee every single time. I tell them no room but they give me the drink with like a quarter of the cup being air every single time.
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2016-11-13,1,Honestly avoid this Starbucks. Rude as hell and very disorganized. These workers seriously don't give a shit about there customers. Even the manager is unaware of the rudeness she brings to the table. Don't get your coffee here
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2016-11-04,1,"Burned coffee. Slow on purpose. Aggressively ambivalent. Attitude without eye contact. 

Brewed coffee sometimes tastes bitter. Did they burn it? Use too many grounds? Who cares? They probably don't.

Can't get your order right. You may have to repeat what you're asking multiple times. They may still get it wrong. This is you're fault, not theirs.

Let completed orders queue up on the back counter. You get to stand at the pickup counter and watch your finished drink sitting on the back counter while they add other finished drinks to the pile. Once a satisfactory number of people and finished drinks have piled up they'll then move all the drinks at once from the back counter to the pickup counter. Yours may be cold by then. Deal with it. This is the process they sometimes employ.

Simply can't get names right. Will send your order out with the wrong name. Will give you attitude if you point this out after waiting forever for your name to be called. Remember, it's your fault, not theirs. Your name is Susan? No. now your name is Kelly.

After talking amongst themselves and avoiding eye contact for a sufficient period of time to make you aware that you are nothing to them, they will give you such attitude when ordering your drink you are made to feel like everything wrong in the world is your fault, and by politely ordering coffee you have behaved ignorantly and imposed an onerous burden upon them. Look of disgust, short words, rolled eyes, how dare you order coffee in a Starbucks.

This place is utterly slammed when they're busy. Line snaking around and around. Despite the many baristas, they can't handle it.

And when it's slow and there's hardly anyone there, it's not much better.

all the other reviews citing slow, rude, inaccurate service are true."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2016-10-09,2,"Consistently the worst Starbucks in the area. Overstaffed yet deadly slow, they forget many orders and any sort of food order grinds them to a halt."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2016-08-31,1,"I have 3 words for this location
What
The
Fuck...
I've never been to a more disorganized and ""i don't give a fuck"" minded Starbucks. The cashier had horrible listening and never gave me my receipt. I ordered a grande and got charged for one but my ticket said tall, for some reason. So i had to wait for the chick to remake my drink. And then I payed for specifics like drizzle and extra powder and it tastes like a normal one and i didn't get my drizzle i had to walk back for it.  I spent half of my freaking break in there. There were 3 people working including cashier and one guy leaves when a long line formed. Leaving the one poor chick to make 10 drinks by herself. Seriously? I work around the corner and service like this is not cute. This is the SLOWEST Starbucks I've ever been too. Y'all need to have a secret shopper or something soon because this isn't cute. A trip to your store shouldn't be a trip of mistakes."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2016-07-20,4,"This is my preferred location for the morning commute.  Right next to the NQR on 49th and 7th.  

Yes, there's often a line in the morning due to everyone shuffling to work, but it's hardly noticeable regarding the wait time.  The baristas are great!  Very nice and super quick!  My drinks are always on par =)  Nothing worse than getting the wrong thing (or a bad thing) first thing in the morning, so kudos to them!  This is why I keep coming back!

The service up front is decent.  I guess no one is ever super unpleasant, but no one is ever super welcoming either.  Overall, they're pretty good and certainly good enough.  I think there was only one time when one of the women got frustrated that I wanted to pay with my phone app bc she didn't hear me request it, and she had to change payment method.  Oh wells...maybe it was a rough day?  I've actually seen her multiple times, and she was fine.  

In any case, this shall be my Starbucks home for the commuting hours =)"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2016-07-14,2,"This Starbucks never seems to get my order right or make my drink well. I ordered a chai latte and got a vanilla latte, my venti green tea latte had barely any matcha in it, and drinks in general aren't nearly as good as they are at other starbucks. The staff are nice and it appears like they are working as quickly as they can - maybe it's  the lack of training."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2016-07-11,1,Very disrespectful  staff..Also takes for ages to get any beverage. The place is busy but that should not be any excuse for being rude..
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2016-07-07,2,"How long does it take to take an order and prepare coffee!
From the time we entered to the time we left with coffee was over 15 minutes. And there was not many customers inside!
Pull up your socks starbucks!"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2016-06-14,2,"We were rushing to a matinee Broadway show and I was scared I would hit my afternoon slump midway through, so we made a quick stop for a shaken iced tea. Thinking it shouldn't take more than a few minutes, we ducked inside.

The baristas were standing around chatting among themselves. I stood there for a while waiting... And waiting... And waiting. I think it wasn't until at least a few whole minutes before they noticed I was standing there and took my order. I wish I could comment that they scrambled apologetically to take my order, but no. They were not one bit sorry that they didn't give a damn about me or my needs as a customer. 

So all in all? Every Starbucks customer complaining about how slow the service here? I thought they were just exaggerating but it's a legitimate general complaint. If you're in a rush to get anywhere, I wouldn't suggest this Starbucks location as your go-to."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2015-07-17,3,"Pros:
1) It seems busy (esp during 8:00 am, pre-workday coffee rush) but the line moves insanely quick, so I do give the employees kudos for that. 3 stars for efficiency. 
2) I actually quite enjoy their sausage cheddar and egg breakfast sandwich. 

That being said, those are about the only pros. 

Cons:
1) Employees are rude (most of em don't smile), save for 2 or 3 (you guys make my morning, seriously). They just want you in and out. Just saying, I worked in service, and I feel for you so I WILL tip for good service. If you even give me so much as a smile or a ""Have a nice day,"" you'll walk home with a few extra dollars (CASH) in your pocket. You'd be surprised at how far a smile will go.
2) It's a tundra in there - I think they purposefully make it 50 degrees and blast the air so you won't hang out too long. Bring a sweatshirt.
3) No outlets. Don't plan on having an emergency phone charge session/don't plan to stay after your laptop has run outta juice. 
4) There's the same homeless (?) guy who takes up an entire table for hours on end but he just sleeps. Doesn't bother anyone. Depending on who you are I guess this isn't so much of a con, more of a ""thing-to-note"" 'cause it's one less table.
5) Tons of tourists - you're a stone's throw away from Times Square. Most of them do not understand the social norms of NYC (i.e., they will stand in the way of everyone trying to get their coffee and get out.)
6) There's only one door to go in and out of, which I find incredibly annoying bc you sometimes open the door to go out yourself only to then hold the door open for a stream of (you guessed it) tourists to walk into this tiny Sbux in their giant herds.
7) Space is really small - good luck finding a table at peak hours. I'd say there are 6 small round tables and 1 bar (with 4 chairs).

There's also a huge difference between getting there at 8:00 am v. getting there at 8:30. But like I said, don't let the line intimidate you. At that point, it becomes more of an issue of whether you can stand that many people that early in the morning. But hey, you're in NYC for a reason, right?"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2015-07-14,3,"Nothing as terrible as other reviews have said, but they are definitely slower here. I've noticed this trend with NYC Starbucks."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2015-07-12,1,"I rarely leave bad reviews but these folks can't take an order to save their life! Also, apparently the Barista doesn't understand what Upside Down is! FAIL!!! This is your job to know this! You are in a High traffic location! Step your game up please! Brittany is the only one with any sense! Smh! Thanks for correcting the order!"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2015-01-06,3,The tea is great. The service is quick. The store is clean. My only issue is that the music is just too loud. A lot of people come to the coffee shop to relax or to do work and this loud techno music is just overwhelming. It really affects the environment.
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2014-12-27,1,"Main floor and bathrooms are Really dirty. Also, Don't know if it's the lack of management in this place or the lack of motivation and work ethic of the employees. Unfortunately, I believe it's both."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2014-12-21,2,"Service, as many have said, is slow. One of the girls working the register was super impatient with some Japanese tourists whom she overcharged. I'm sure it gets very challenging to try to take drink orders/explain things to people whose English isn't great, but you work at Starbucks in Times Square: that's part of the job!

Also, no whipped cream on my drink (when it comes with it); she says, ""I put caramel on it.""  While the two things are not the same, I just moved on with my morning."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2014-07-13,1,"Considering it's Sunday and the people traffic isn't to heavy I figured the wait wouldn't be bad at all. Well I was wrong there was one guy at the register and one barista. Okay fine I get you're one guy making drinks but I waited a LONG time for my drink. Aside from that I ordered a peach green tea lemonade, and guess what they didn't have lemonade...how don't you have lemonade considering it's summer and ALL you advertise is tea with lemonade...! Then I was going to go use the bathroom but wait how could anything go right at this Starbucks, it was out of order! At that point I was annoyed, and went to get a straw at the counter and there was milk and sugar everywhere it looked as if no one went to clean there for a good 5 hours. Gross."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2014-07-01,4,"As Starbucks go, service is slow, lines out the door, but the staff are very friendly and make the wait worth it by making great beverages."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2014-06-07,2,"The bad reviews for service are right on.  I think the only way this store stays open is due to it's convenient location, not what I've come to expect from Starbucks."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2014-04-05,1,"Wow. Horribly managed. 4 people working. 1 at bar, two doing nothing at the register, 1 refilling stuff, and 15 drinks in queue. 

For shame"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2014-01-22,3,"I'm not sure how I've gone all this time without reviewing this location, especially since it's my office building. 

This particular location is a bit of a beast. For one, as with any breakfast spot, the line is way to long and not worth waiting in. I go upstairs, settle in and come back down around 9 and it's usually smooth sailing. 

I can honestly say they've never screwed up my order, which is a first. They usually get my name wrong, which is annoying, but I can overlook that on a correct order. 

Starbucks is never my go-to, but it's super convenient when I need a midday snack or latte."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2013-12-03,1,"I try so hard to stay away from this particular Starbucks because it's just like walking into your worst nightmare. I swear the line coils all the way from the back to the front during rush hour (which I avoid like the plague), they are slow, and the baristas are some of the most childish ones I've encountered. I've seen them mix regular milk with soy (which is a huge deal if you are lactose intolerant, like myself). This one time I wanted a drip of soy milk in my espresso (which I can grab from the bar cold) and they wanted to charge me for it! I had ordered this several times in the past - never charged, but that day the girl who rang me up insisted she could charge me. The manager came up and gave me a speech about how ""soy is more expensive than regular"". Don't school me on the cost of soy milk, I'm very familiar with this which is why I don't complain every time I pay extra for my lattes. But for a drip ... on my doppio espresso?? I paid for it because I wasn't going to continue arguing but as soon as I turned my back they were gossiping about how I didn't want to pay those 60 cents. So unprofessional. 

And just today, a barista (I think named Alyssa or something with an A) called out the name of a drink for a patron. When the person who ordered it came up to her (clearly a tourist from an Asian country) this girl says ""I have no idea what that says there , I won't even try to say it"" referring to the patron's name on the cup! 

God, so rude. 

I've been going to Financier for the most part just so I avoid walking in here but every now and then I will convince myself I can endure another trip to this hole. It shouldn't be this way!"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2013-04-23,1,"the WORST starbucks ever !!! i ordered for ICE green tea latte, and i got HOT green tea latte. then i asked why i got the cold one. and the worker rudely replied then poured the hot green tea latte to a new glass and added a lot of ice. she didnt make a new one. the taste of this green tea latte was sucks !!! i couldnt taste any green tea there. taste was only water, added by green tea. also, i ordered a cake. it took sooooo long time till i came back to cashier and asked for my order.. no bathroom inside.. this is the worst starbucks everrrr.. i'm really disappointed with this starbucks. the employees are not friendly at all.."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2013-03-13,3,"Its a Starbucks, a chain focused on supplying magical caffeine conveniently every four blocks. This one is smaller than average, but still larger than the one on 43rd and Times Sq. The baristas seem nice, the lines move quickly, they get my drink right. I have had no issues about my drinks.

Unfortunately, this location is overrun with tourists (is there a bus tour stop or something nearby?) so the line can be overrun with people who are not used to the Starbucks hell run that most morning commutes include. There are about 10 seats in the back, but with the heavy traffic here, you'd feel very claustrophobic unless you were the lucky ones in the corner. Not recommended to sit here for more than 20 minutes - the laser blue lighting from the Barclay's building across the street will get to you."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2013-02-13,1,"The WORST Starbucks I have ever been to. Seriously, if this was close to home, I'd be temped to write to Starbucks just to let them know the disaster taking place here. First of all, there were plenty of people in here (which still confuses me), but I had to wait 3-4 min for a barista to show up and take my order. In the middle of taking my order, the barista starts having a conversation, over my head, to another employee standing across the room about clocking in. Really?

Okay so slow service and inattentiveness aside, this place was also filthy. I didn't want to sit down. When I reluctantly did, there was spilt coffee all over the table and floors. Plus crumbs everywhere.  Please avoid this place."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2012-10-05,1,"I was in this Starbucks tonight around 7, there was no line, only one man before me, but he was asking something to the barista/cashier, and i had my headphone on so I didn't know what was he asking but he looked irritated and their conversation went on a while. After the man paid for his transaction the barista/cashier continued her chatting with another barista, was in no rush to serve the next customer (me). Finally she looked back out the counter and ready to take my order, i looked at her and told her 'Can i have a salted caramel hot chocolate', although she was looking at me, her mind was elsewhere, so she asked 'what is it?' I said ""can i have a salted caramel hot chocolate"", she reached over to a cup and getting a marker to write my order on the cup, and asked me again 'what is it again?' I said, for the 3rd time 'Salted caramel..' she continued ' salted caramel mocha?' I said, 'no, hot chocolate'.  
At the end when i got my drink, it was a plain normal hot chocolate, not a 'salted caramel hot chocolate' which i repeated 3 times to her."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2012-04-20,1,"I was going on a tour that was leaving in the same area and stopped by with my family to get some breakfast. 

It was busy, really busy, though the workers seemed efficient... Boy was I incorrect. I ordered my coffee and some baked goods and after getting my coffee and paying I waited for my baked goods. 5, 10 minutes go buy and I told the cashier that I never got them. She hurries and gets a few of them and says my bagel will be done in a minute. 10-15 minutes later nothing. I get back in line since that the only way I can get anyones attention. The cashier I got said she remembered someone making that order but can not figure out where it went...

This was a highly inefficient starbucks that just left me angry. Not worth it."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2010-08-19,5,"I know, I know, all Starbucks are virtually the same.  I just happen to like this one because its right next to the subway and my building for work.  Since there are so many business men in Times Square and my building alone probably supplies their business, the service is fast and they have four different people to take orders, ring-up drinks and then make them.  I love how fast they are!"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2009-08-12,1,"Worst Starbucks, it was 1,000 degrees here this morning when it was 90 outside. Don't under stand why places in NYC tend to turn of their AC and think having the door open is a substitute. 

Also I'm pretty sure they gave me decaf. Never going here again"
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2008-05-11,1,"Haiku for Starbucks in Hell, I mean Midtown:

Surly barista.
Tourists.  Coffee spilled on floor
days ago.  So gross."
144,starbucks-new-york-564,2007-11-27,2,"Tiny, tiny store that is super, super packed during the NYC marathon weekend. I was however able to find a nice NYC mug that the other million Starbucks didn't have."
145,proper-food-new-york-3,2019-11-01,4,"This review is for their coffee only.

I was seeing a show at the Cort Theater and needed a jolt of coffee!  I stumbled into this place, located in a passageway between 47th/48th St, right next to the theatre. What a nice find!  The walkway was spacious, clean, and surprisingly quiet!  Proper Foods has a few tables outside and it made for a very pleasant coffee break!

I didn't try any of their food items, so I can't speak about that, but the coffee is freshly made by the cup, and it was fantastic.  Just what I needed.  I must add that customer service was top-notched!  I didn't get the young lady's name who helped me  but she was so friendly and pleasant!  How refreshing.  She alone gets 5 stars!

I would definitely return for a good cup of coffee!"
145,proper-food-new-york-3,2019-08-07,3,"Kind staff. Clean establishment. Very efficient service. When you eat here, you'll feel like you're eating the healthiest food ever because it's all flavorless. Like the main ingredient might be air. I had curry chicken and tomato soup. You forget what it tastes like the minute you swallow a bite."
145,proper-food-new-york-3,2019-07-18,4,Very good airline food. Fair price. Seating in the plaza outside which is actually not too loud. Would I go here again? I won't be a regular but I'd keep it as an option.
145,proper-food-new-york-3,2019-07-11,5,"After 9 months of working in the area I just discovered this gem tucked away between a 47th and 48th street walkway. The first time I stopped in I had the portobello sandwich and loved it. Since then I've been back and had the Sweet Potato and Egg Muffin Nest and the cheddar chive biscuit and just WOW I LOVED both. I cannot find ANY place that has fresh locally sourced delicious food anywhere in midtown at these prices. I don't normally leave reviews but after I saw that this place had some negative reviews I had to step in and say something! Sure, is this a more expensive version of quick style Pret a Manger type food? Maybe. But I think that's precisely what New York needs. Sometimes we don't have the time to wait 30 minutes it'll take to walk to a dig inn or sweet green and wait on the massive lunch line for that healthy food. Sometimes you need quick and easy without compromising on good healthy quality or taste. And to be quite honest I think the prices actually end up being cheap depending on what you choose. I spent under $9 on that portobello sandwich! Tell me the last time you spent $9 on local freshly prepared quality food in midtown Manhattan?? Sure if you get a tuna or octopus salad the prices can get steep but tuna and octopus are expensive and Proper foods prices on those salads containing tuna and octopus are more than reasonable for the area!!

Another thing that completely has me hooked is that I absolutely love the ethos of the brand, they shop organic for all of EWG's dirty dozen and the food is prepared fresh daily and any leftovers are donated to food banks at the end of the day. I can eat good and feel good by supporting a place like this!! Do I love all the plastic or warming up food in a microwave? No. But sometimes when you're in a rush it's great to have a quick and easy healthy option, the good outweighs the bad many many times over. I have stood in pret a manger frustrated far too many times only to leave sorely disappointed after spending NYC prices on a lunch I hated but settling because I had no other option. Proper Food to the rescue!! I hope to see them expand and see them all over NYC in the coming years as they grow."
145,proper-food-new-york-3,2019-06-22,5,"Good food at a very reasonable price for mid-town Manhattan. Only takes a couple of minutes to get in and out since everything is pre-packaged (but still fresh). The staff is also very polite and friendly, which is always a nice plus."
145,proper-food-new-york-3,2019-06-10,5,Reasonably priced for a midtown lunch and more upscale than Pret. I had a $8 veggie wrap with a cup of curry soup added on for only $3. They also have a loyalty program which is nice.
145,proper-food-new-york-3,2019-05-21,2,"I found this place using the Ritual App. If you sign up you get money off your first meal. 
I found this on the app and gave it a try. I got the chicken bacon sandwich. 
All the meals are prepped ahead and seem to be fresh. 
My main rating is the price. Way over priced for what you get. The taste of the sandwich didn't wow me. I felt I could buy this bread, chicken, and bacon and do it myself. This was a $8 sandwich. One side was cooked and the other was soggy. Wrapped in aluminum foil. 

I had a 5 dollar discount through the app and I am glad I didn't pay full price. 

If I decide to go again, I would get a salad next time and again would only go with a discount. 

Shame it didn't impress me. If they added more meat and higher quality bread, might be better."
145,proper-food-new-york-3,2019-05-01,2,"This is an over-priced Pret style restaurant. Salads are small, over priced and in plastic containers.

I got a lemon quinoa salad with chicken for $13. Minimal amount of spinach. The spinach was not young (it was darker, larger, tougher). The feta was less than a table spoon in a small container.

Seems healthy but the package is missing nutrition facts and the full ingredient lists."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2020-01-21,5,I am a coffee addict and am particular about my coffee beans. I am meticulous about my coffee preparation like grinding my own beans and brewing my coffee every morning. The day I tasted Blue bottle's coffee I fell in love and is my first choice till date. I buy my beans from them. Blue bottle has my loyalty for life
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-12-31,4,"I love places that only have pour over, and not drip. It takes a little longer but it's so much better. Pricey, but for a specialty coffee shop, about standard. I also appreciated the patience as the barista reiterated directions about the bathroom situation for what seemed like the millionth time that day."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-11-21,1,Today was a rare occasion I had cash a coworker reimbursed me for something. I exclusively use Amex love my points. But today  I thought I'll use my cash  to pay for my coffee but was told no cash.  I was offended and mention to the cashier that this seems like discrimination and she says we are to busy to take cash. Yet they  have time to ask me for a tip on the iPad?  I said what about people with out credit cards? She assured me homeless people are not spending $5 on a cup of coffee. However my daughter and my niece who attended prestigious private schools did not get credit cards till they were older and would be acceptable to the  cashier as they have homes -I guess they are also excluded from going to your coffee shop. As are anyone trying to live a credit card free life. I was offended by the practice and more so by the cashier judgment about people using cash and making it clear that they discriminates against any one they seen not worthy of having a credit card. If Starbucks can close to retrain there people blue bottle should do the same.
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-11-15,5,"EXPERIENCE 
Pour Over - Papua New Guinea
- Rich body, fresh, smooth, cinnamon, fruity, molasses, subtle acidic notes, roasty. 
- pretty good, sourness builds as it sits.

SERVICE 
- very good

RECOMMENDATIONS
- labeling your pour over as drip is a bit confusing for someone looking for actual drip (already brewed coffee)
- I would offer real drip to allow customers to sample. 
- in the mean time, everybody is getting the freshest coffee every single time."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-10-13,4,"I came here the other day to take a break from the coffee in my office and it was a nice change. It was a bit loud, and more crowded than I would expect around 3PM on a Friday. Despite the line initially being intimidating, it moved very fast. I ordered a hojicha latte without really knowing what it was other than a certain type of green tea. The first sip d8djt have me thrilled, but the more I drank it, the more I enjoyed it."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-09-17,5,Great coffee much better than Starbucks..blue bottle coffee and Nespresso are the best
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-08-04,5,"After reading the reviews and history of this place, I was expecting something very similar to Starbucks. This minimalist and hipster cafe is actually quite good, and I very much enjoyed both the vibe and coffee! It also appeals to the lactose intolerant; while you must pay an extra $1 for the almond milk, they offer oat milk at no extra cost.

I got the New Orleans, a sweetened cold brew, with oat milk. It had none of the acidity that I dislike, and had very rich and hearty undertones - almost like a velvety chocolate! The oat milk also made it super creamy and smooth.

Their paper straws are much thicker and higher quality than anything I've had before. I really wish they'd open in Canada, as I'd probably be a frequent customer!"
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-08-02,5,"While I also went to 53rd instead of 52nd, this is my favorite Blue Bottle location because of the people who work there. I looked so tired that someone gave me a free cappuccino."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-07-14,5,Loved the pour overs here! I was surprised they didn't sell drip coffee but the pour over was smooth and complex. Really cute coffee shop where I was able to find a table and work.
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-07-04,5,Love this place. I've been to the San Francisco location a few years ago and when I came across Blue Bottle on yelp of course I had to give it a go. Great ambiance and great coffee. The employees were very friendly and didn't hesitate to answer questions we had about the menu.
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-07-01,5,"The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. The coffee was delicious and they let me try two fizz flavours before deciding on the cascara fizz. 
It was pretty loud and busy the whole afternoon, but we did find a little table in the back for a quiet one to one meet up."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-06-19,5,"Cute spot. Good coffee. Smooth cold brew. Can get pretty crowded, especially during work rushes. Similar to the other blue bottles, just feels more commercial and corporate due to the location. I do like that you can chill outside without being overwhelmed by the street and traffic."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-05-08,2,Have Heavy cream as an option.  You are a premium coffee house.  Back to Philz for me.
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-04-24,4,They serve superhero coffee and doll sized food. The iced New Orleans is delicious and will help you save lives.
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-03-31,3,The coffee is great but there is no free wifi or any power outlets. I usually go to coffee shops to work on the weekends and I was surprised that they didn't have wifi. What kinda coffee shop does not have wifi??
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-03-26,4,"It's a blue bottle so the quality is gonna be the same wherever you go. That's a good thing in case you're wondering. It's spacious here and service is good as usual.

My go to is always the New Orleans. Enough said."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-03-25,3,"This location was a pain to find. I wasted almost 15 minutes looking for it this morning on the way to my office. It is NOT on 53rd street as one may think given the address. The building is actually between 53rd and 52nd, and the coffee shop is on 52nd street, though still in the ""10 East 53rd street"" building.  Someone should fix that here on the Yelp page. I walk by here 10 East 53rd street (on 53rd street) almost daily to my office on 5th, and had no idea that this place existed, and in fact could not find it until I walked into the building and kept walking down the wide and long corridor.  Then when I finally found the shop, I wanted to pay with cash. They don't take cash here. Why not? Every other Blue Bottle that I've been to does.  If it wasn't for these two things I would rate this location a 4.  It's the biggest Blue Bottle shop I've been to yet. Plenty of seating and very nicely put together with all of their pastries show cased as well. I will be back for sure now that I know where it is."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-03-16,5,"After visiting Blue Bottle in San Francisco, I'm happy to discover their quality transfers well to the East Coast. This location is a bit hard to find (bottom floor of an office building, outside entrance but sunken down a bit off the street) but the coffee is well worth it. It's locally roasted in Brooklyn, and was just as perfect as I recall it being from a few years back on my last visit."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-03-11,5,"Best latte in midtown, or maybe in entire New York. Friendly staff and perfect environment for brief catch up with friends who work nearby.
Love how they have both standing spots and seats. Wish I could drop by every week."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-03-06,3,"FYI: To avoid confusion...Although this is 53rd location, the address is on 53rd (because of the building) but the shop is actually on the 52nd street side (the building has entrances on both sides).

Coffee tastes great as per usual Blue Bottle.

One comment: Was sad that every person getting ""to-go"" got just a heart while the ""to-stay"" got more intricate latte art at this location. Just something I observed while waiting for my drink.

Why this got a 3 star: To preface, I usually go to the Rockefeller location (but the last time I went was before the Nestle acquisition) where the baristas recognize my colleague and I. However, they never skimp out on us...

As did this location. I was sad that my drink was basically nearly an inch of just foam/air. My usual order of caffe mocha ($6) at the usual location were never this foamy (much more dense with their awesome melted dark chocolate - the way I like it), so it was a bit sad. This was especially annoying, since the day before I ordered a coffee at another establishment that came back 50% air/foam (i.e. ended up being half-full / half-empty whichever way you look at it). Maybe there's just a trend going on for skimping on coffee/chocolate by using air (foam) on the East side..."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2019-02-17,5,"Damn good coffee done by people that take the care and time to give you their best product and service.  Stopped in yesterday afternoon with my brother, sister-in-law, and 2 nieces. Greeted by super friendly staff that answered our first-timer questions, like what the coffee-tonic drink was like. 

We opted for 2 Giant Steps, a cappuccino, and a chocolate milk for one of the youngins. The cappuccino and chocolate milk came out first, and while we were waiting for the drip coffee, the server that took our order came over and said they were making a fresh batch of Giant Steps and it'd just be a little while longer, and gave us free drip coffee (different style that we had asked about - one that had a bit of a fruity flavor, but irked my brother). Awesome! The rest of our order came out shortly thereafter, and I was soon fully uber-caff'ed and ready to go! 

Also like the emphasis on sustainability/reusable silverware; always a plus these days.

Good stuff."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-12-17,4,"Good coffee, pleasant and clean environment. The price is not so expensive but isn't fair enough in my opinion."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-12-16,5,Best coffee place I know in Manhattan. Strong cappuccinos. All regular coffee is Pour over and great. Nice cups if you're staying (unlike Starbucks). Nice tables and chairs. Clean (unlike Starbucks).
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-12-06,3,"More hype than quality.
Long wait for a very expensive mediocre cup of coffee.
Very disappointing and NYC offers many tastier choices."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-11-23,1,"Rude staff.  Overpriced and disappointing coffee.
I approached the store very early on a very cold and wet morning to get some coffee to take back up to our hotel room at the next door Omni Berkshire.  The store had glass double doors.  I attempted to open one of the doors and it was locked.  The two guys working at the counter looked up at me but didn't react.  I went on looking down the street for another nearby coffee shop.  I was getting drenched and freezing, so I turned around to go back.  As I passed the Blue Bottle, I saw one of the workers milling around by the front of the store.  I went back and tried the doors again and realized that the other door I didn't try the first time was unlocked.  Why didn't these guys wave me in the first time I tried to enter?   They were emotionless when I entered and asked if they had been open all along.  I went ahead and bought some overpriced coffee that was cold when we drank it a few minutes later in our hotel room."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-11-21,5,"Let's face it, Blue Bottle is one of the best. Any of their location is a four-star rating to start with. What impresses with this location I was fortunate enough to discover after a museum visit is that they are full scale cafe with seating in addition to offering their trademark drip coffee selection and cold brews. I am ultra jealous of the folks that work in the building which this location is situated in. Those folks wouldn't even have to walk to get their hands on a BB coffee. The closest location near me is six blocks away. With that said, it was exciting to discover this new location in the heart of midtown. This will be a treat to look forward to anytime I am shopping in the area or visiting the MOMA!"
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-10-28,4,Address shown can be a bit confusing as it's actually accessible through both 52nd and 53rd streets. This isn't really a sit-down-and-catch-up kind of place and more suited to getting your coffee to go. That's fine because I've always found the coffee here to be quite good (albeit pricey).
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-10-24,5,"Got a cortado to go. It was so good, smooth, not bitter at all. I usually love to put tons of milk and sugar in my coffee but I drank this black and it was  delicious. I will come back for sure!"
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-10-22,5,"Just what I expected with Blue Bottle. The coffee was delicious and the service great. 

We had a little bit of hard time finding the place bc the main entrance is actually located on 52nd St and not 53rd."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-09-30,5,"Amazing coffee, even better service, will always come back. The espresso was some of the best I have ever had. Staff incredibly knowledgeable"
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-09-18,4,"Clean and nice coffee, my favorite spot around the area.

Tasteful & intense smell, what else!

A small outside area is available."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-05-26,5,"We live in NYC & LA and every day we are in NYC we walk to this blue bottle! The employees are so friendly and the coffee is always good. 

It's good to know that they have all types of milk and all the substitutes you could image if you don't drink dairy.

I think it's more on the expensive side but it's high end coffee if that's even a thing: it's made fresh infront if you, they have the highest quality ingredients plus it's all served in a marble floor. I've had the little pastries before but I don't usually get them because they are so rich."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-05-11,4,"Tried the Giant Step coffee - 4 stars for doing custom pour overs of each order  process and service was awesome, coffee was...it just didn't do it for me. I'll try another flavor tomorrow!"
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-04-20,4,"Great coffee roasters!!! The only reason to not give 5 stars would be the kind of limited seating, and that I wouldn't recommend it as a cozy and quiet place to work"
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-03-05,2,"I went to the blue bottle in Rockefeller center, was blown away, and had to get it again when I was in New York this past weekend. This was right next to the hotel I was staying in so I went here. Uh, I'm not sure why but the taste was just not what i remembered? Maybe it was because I got my latte with almond milk this time but it actually was just pretty awful. My friend got the mocha and that was also honestly just eh. Last time I seriously was blown away by the amazing latte, so I don't think it's my memory, and I generally like almond milk as a replacement for whole milk, so I can't imagine the substitution would make me hate the latte. I guess I'll just have to try the Rockefeller center location again next time but this time was definitely severely disappointing."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-01-24,2,Huge lines. Please have less registrars and add an extra coffee machine. Waiting times are annoyingly long.
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2018-01-01,4,"Lovely espresso getaway tucked into a high ceiling, marble floor type of office building in Midtown East. Come on, everyone needs a break from the high fashion name brands that scream in his/her face on Fifth Avenue.

I really appreciate the spacious layout of the cafe. There's a good amount of standing and seating space for you to choose. No awkward shoulder to shoulder contact with a stranger while waiting for your drink. 

My only drawback is the longer wait for your order right after you purchase. On average, I've stood around for about 5 minutes. It might be because of the office crowds that also come in, along with tourists. And they usually come in groups. Who knows - it's not a dealbreaker in my book but take note of this if you're in a caffeine rush."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2017-12-31,4,"Very quiet after lunch hours, the baristas are super friendly + the cafe mocha is to die for! Really strong chocolatey flavour with a caffeinated kick! It's great but try not to drink BBC with an empty stomach, might get a little upset because it's pretty thick"
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2017-12-13,2,"This place has mostly good reviews here, but after trying it, I'll be one of the few to say that I don't understand why this place is good.

I purchased two coffees of their drip light blend.  Total was $8.17 for two coffees.  Starbucks, I realize not the gold standard for coffee, but nevertheless a pricing reference point is at $4.67 for two tall coffees.

The setup:

They make all coffees freshly ground, put into a filter and using a pour-over method with a standard paper filter.  You can do this at home and you'll quickly realize that if this is your method, it takes a little more time and the flavor is a bit different than a standard percolated coffee.  This is different, which is good, but they executed this poorly.  What they need to do to fix it: when making coffee with this method, the water should be extra hot as the liquid is more exposed to a colder air temperature.

On the side, they only have half and half.  You have to ask them for whole milk as it's preciously protected behind the counter.

They give you metal spoons that are cleaned and ready to use to stir your coffee.  This makes you feel more classy.  Afterall, you did pay double for that cup of joe.

Do you like sugar in the raw in your coffee?  You won't get it here.  Instead, you will get sugar cane simple syrup, presumably made by them.

Finally, the lid in the to go cup is translucent, making you think it's more designed for cold beverage use.  You will use it anyway because that's all they have.   Like stoppers to take along to prevent your coffee from spilling?  I don't personally use them, but my coworker likes his that way, and they don't have them here.

Summary: I won't be back, but I might go to Amazon to buy a pour-over setup for home use so I can do everything right that blue bottle does wrong."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2017-12-06,2,"Ordered at the counter and after waiting 10-15 minutes and seeing multiple people who ordered subsequent to me get their orders, I had to check in on my coffee, which they apparently had no record of. Thankfully they gave me the next available cup of what I ordered.

Also, the cups and lids are so thin that the coffee was room temp by the time I got to my office (less than 5 minutes away). For how much you pay for the coffee, they shouldn't be so flimsy..."
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2017-10-24,5,"I've heard many good things about Blue Bottle Coffee and I haven't tried it until today. I'm so glad Blue Bottle Coffee opened up at this location, now I can come by anytime! 

The coffee shop's entrance is actually closer to E 52nd street. If you happen to come to E 53rd, you should see Equinox next door. Just walk through the public arcade doors and the Blue Bottle Coffee is located at the other end (Left side). They have both indoor and outdoor seating!

Since it was my first time here, the baristas gave me a lot recommendations and I went for their latte! The espresso in this coffee is so strong and I loved it! It was definitely a good kick to keep you awake throughout the day!"
146,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-14,2017-10-06,5,"Yayyy! I am a fan of blue bottle! We have been waited for so long to have blue bottle downstairs, and now it is about to realize!! I feel really excited and hope to enjoy their coffee more and more often during weekdays!"

147,starbucks-new-york-148,2019-11-07,2,"Starbucks at 825 Eighth Avenue is close to both Times Square and Broadway, it's a pretty average store by Manhatten standards but still remains pretty small compared to what I'm used to back in the UK.

I called in here mainly to take a look and purchase some merch and use the bathrooms - the merch selection was okay and they did have a good amount of the Venti Iced $3 cups which I can't get back home in the UK, which not only allows me to get a bigger drink but I also end up saving 0.32 dollars a time when converted, so it's definitley worth buying one if you're coming from the UK.

The staff seemed okay, the selection of most fresh prepared food and everything else was average.

It wasn't the cleanest of stores and the bathrooms were not only hard to get into with a lock code but really dirty to the point I didn't even want to use it so headed somewhere else.

Far from the greatest Starbucks store in and around Times Square, that title must go to the Reserve Bar on Broadway, but still, it is one of the quieter stores with an average selection of pre-prepared food/drink and merch to warrant an extra star.

147,starbucks-new-york-148,2019-10-15,5,Fast and friendly service! Everyone was smiling (even though it was very early in the morning). It was a great way to start my day!
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2019-10-01,3,"Not the neatest  Starbucks around but it worked. (I think b/c it's in the theatre district they don't check the restroom frequently- or maybe they do? It just needs to be checked more. Ironically it has a combination lock on it but they have printed a sign underneath it to tell you the code. I surmise that they got tired of always telling everyone the code) My daughter wanted her chai tea and I obliged. We also wanted to rest our feet before we carried on with our crazy day going to the theatre and the Broadway Flea market on 44th which raises money for Broadway Cares. At least the people who work 
here are friendly! Thank you"
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2019-04-14,3,"This location is inundated with rude tourists and kids. I feel kind of sorry for the folks who work in the building because if they want to come here sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee or a snack on a break, they can forget it. It took forever for me to get my drink due to the confused outta towners that fail to realize all Starbucks have the same menu and noisy teenagers. Despite all of the issues the employees are chipper friendly and make your drinks as best they can under the circumstances. I had to have my order remade due to receiving a latte instead of a flat white, which ended up being perfect. When I do observations in the area, I try to support them at this location with a smile.  They need it.  So if you are in the area make sure you come here to encourage and tip the staff."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2019-03-07,5,It's a Starbucks! Friendly staff and always yummy Starbucks snacks! Large open space with plenty of seating.
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2019-01-30,1,"Line here is usually awful and today the barista decided texting someone was more important than my order. She actually kept her phone in her hand THE ENTIRE TIME I was at the counter. In all seriousness, what in the hell has happened to the customer service industry????"
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2018-11-14,2,"Starbucks will always be Starbucks. The service is terrible. I used to mobile order on this store all the time and it was reliable, but I stopped because they would always have a problem with the order. Either they ran out of what I ordered and didn't tell me until I got there, or they just made one item from my order so when I got there I had to wait another 5 minutes. The reason I mobile order is because I'm in a hurry...I have missed my train to work several times now because of this."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2018-10-27,2,"Standard Starbucks. Overpriced, undersized, overcaffenated hot and cold beverages for the office worker and hotel staying masses."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2018-07-30,5,Staff is excellent! They are friendly and always working nonstop. They make it a fun place. They play the best music unlike some other locations.
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2018-06-13,4,"Visiting NYC for the first time this week. This Starbucks location is a half block from our hotel and has become my go-to hangout to read and gave my typical rental green iced tea. Also find seating even though there are always people there. After four visits so far, staff has been nice and the music pleasant. I usually stay for a few hours and read which has been enjoyable each time. Except the restroom. Used once and it was a disaster. Hoping that was an anomaly. Will find out later as I will continue to hang out here."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2018-05-19,5,"I just finished getting off the phone with my 62-year-old mother. I want to say THANK YOU to the young lady behind the counter in this Starbucks who helped my mom from a seemingly crazy guy who scared the hell out of her by following her from the train station!!! This piece of sh!t of a human being chose to pick on a little old lady (MY MOTHER) who was heading home after a full day of hard work as a hotel housekeeper in the Crowne Plaza nearby. She was going to take the C train-- just missed the elevator and headed toward the stairs while at the same time trying to close her umbrella. He spotted her going down the subway stairs, all alone, no crowd of people or a soul (where are the cops when you actually need them?) on the stairs or by the turnstile and went after her. Guy go too close to her, and demanded her umbrella, then her cup of coffee, and when my mom figured he would go for her purse next she freaked out and ran up the stairs. She looked behind and there he was, right behind her trying get at her. After screaming at him to go away and saw that he still followed her, she ran into the Starbucks and begged the woman behind the register to help her make the man go away because she was scared. Thankfully she went right up to the guy and scream at him to leave, as did other staff members. A man, (customer?) offered to walk my mom to the station since he saw how shook up she was (thank you).

This was around 3:10pm on a Saturday (5/19/18).

Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU! I pray no one else's mother (or sister, aunt, cousin, grandma, etc) ever has to go through this but of course, this is the world we live in. At least there are good people to help balance it out!

I am in another city and state and try to check in on her every couple of days. It's the worst feeling having to hear your mama go through this but I'm so thankful nothing worse happened. 

THANK YOU!

I've tried calling the store but no one is answering, figure I might as well thank you all on here."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2018-03-21,5,"Best Barista ever goes to Anna! Customer service the way it's supposed to be! Five stars for the girl behind the bar! ""KEEP SHINING LIKE ONE KID!""+++"
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2018-02-21,3,"I go here each morning for coffee and breakfast sandwiches. Its a high- volume time of day but the staff does a good job and has a friendly demeanor. 
My one constant gripe is about the environment of this Starbucks. 
Specifically, the doors. Both of them. They both emit a loud, ear-piercing shreik every 20 seconds when a customer enters or leaves. PLEASE FIX THIS. It is distracting and painful for your customers waiting in line, makes me want to walk elsewhere to get coffee."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2018-02-15,1,"Continues to be the worst Starbucks I have ever been to, but since I work the same building I find myself forced to frequent here when I'm in a time crunch and feel like torturing myself. The employees actually behave as though you are inconveniencing them by placing an order. They sing, dance, chat, etc. all while a line is out the door and around the corner. 

Just this morning there were three people working, a line of five people waiting to be helped, and no one taking orders - the employees were all doing other menial tasks that had nothing to do with serving their customers or alleviating the line. 

To further emphasize the inefficiency of this establishment, they never have straws  where you pick up your drink so you have to walk through the line and out the other door to complete your coffee run, after you've already wasted 15 minutes listening to them catch up about their personal lives and sweep the floor while you beg them to make eye contact so you can be served. Terribly managed Starbucks."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2018-01-26,5,"Come to this Starbucks all the time. Even though it's always packed, I always manage to find a place to sit. The workers here are extremely friendly, and play great music. I love this place."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2017-12-20,1,"I used to be a regular customer at this Starbucks, but I will no longer patronize this location. One of the employees- Nathely- is always rude and unkind toward customers. She has ignored me and she has shouted at me. Recently, I asked if I could have some steamed milk due to my coffee being too sweet. This angered her and she shouted at me- over my request for steamed milk! She is unqualified for her job and needs an education in how to treat others and training in providing customer service."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2017-11-04,1,"Used to be a great place but is now just terrible. Incredibly slow, ""hot""coffee is often cold, and they blast music so loud that's it's impossible to read or study."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2017-08-26,2,"I frequently visit Starbucks and was unfortunately unimpressed by this location. It was a busy and hot Saturday afternoon and they did not even have ice for their drinks. As a previous bartender and sever, I know if your ice machine is down, you should at least purchase ice from a nearby store or pick some up from another Starbucks location. However, they did not seem interested in finding a solution to this issue. 

After I received my ""non-iced"" tea from my mobile order, I continued to wait for my blueberry oatmeal. When it had not arrived after another 5 minutes, I asked a barista if it was still in the works. They proceeded to tell me they did not have blueberries and looked at me as if I would no longer want my oatmeal. They hadn't made it because they didn't have one ingredient, and could have easily said my name to find me and then explained the situation. Being offered a solution or refund would have been greatly appreciated. Just ignoring the order completely is terrible customer service. 

It's safe to say I will be walking a little further to another Starbucks next time."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2017-05-18,1,"This is the most disappointing experience for me about this location. 

I came in and want to buy some sandwiches on 5/18/17 Thursday night around 7:40. 
And I ordered my turkey protein box. Inside there are few slices pieces of apple and some carrots.
Then after I biked 1-2 carrots, I found that the carrot is very watery and most of the carrots are rotten and have some bad smell. 
Then I informed to the cashier and she is helping me to do the refund or exchange a new one.

All the sudden, there is a staff come up and his name is George. And he shout out :"" come on bro, I don't even eat the carrots, who will eat it, it is not even expired until tomorrow (5/19) and he think I am making a big deal and because of the carrots that i need to refund. I feel very humiliated and feel insulted by him.  

First of all, I pay the full price for my food, if the food is not right or have bad smell. I believe that I have my right to speak out and ask for refund. This is what I pay for. 

Second, I am concerned about how this location keep their serving food. Even not expired food, how would it has smell and not check their stock well. 

Third, I don't appreciate someone yell out and blame me like I make the mistake for asking exchange. Because rotten food is very dangerous for everyone. It is not just for me. What if a child eat it and have infection by the rotten food.

Unfortunately the manager is out of town as the cashier told me. I have no way to explain and tell the whole frustration. I feel very sorry about Starbuck service now."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2017-04-05,1,"There were only 2 people working on a Wednesday afternoon at 5:30pm. I guess they don't get that busy but there was a decent line. I ordered the toasted coconut cold brew which I was so  excited about but wow what a disappointment. I had to throw it out. It was the worst coffee drink I have ever had, not to mention there was ZERO coconut flavor!"
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2016-10-01,2,Why do all of the Starbucks here don't have a bathroom for paying customers. Really????
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2016-09-24,3,Yikes..  wrong sandwich given and I think they forgot our order because they had to ask a couple times what we got.  The location is extremely busy and could use at least a couple more people working.
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2016-08-27,1,"Don't BS me that you can't make any frozen drinks because you're, ""out of cream,"" 30 minutes before close because you don't feel like cleaning the blenders again.

AND I'm pretty sure, ""It goes down in the DM,"" is not on the Starbucks approved playlist.

Just wanted to get a dessert for my mother in law on a 100 degree day. 

Thanks for ruining the night."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2016-07-20,2,"After having come here several times, it's sad to say that I'd rather go to a location that's further, seeing as this place is less than a block away from my apartment. I guess that's okay though since there's a Starbucks on every corner in midtown =P but for reals. Service can be pretty terrible up front. The guy I always see making the drinks is pretty nice though. Music is awesome. Seating and drinks are good enough. However, they're terribly understaffed it seems. I often wait longer here than other places relative to the line, but this morning has been exceptionally awful. I write this as I still wait over ten mins for my drink in a pretty short line, and will likely be a bit late. Not good for  a quick in and out as I feel these places should be, especially for the morning rush."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2016-06-10,1,"1. The girl who made me the Caramel Waffle Cone Frappuccino. She doesn't know how to clean up the cup AFTER THE MESS... Because it was so wet, sticky and disgusting outside the cup... when I touched it I'm like seriously??!!! 
2. Another girl who clean the floor she use the broom to sweep on my jean and sneaker!!! THIS IS SO DISGUSTING AND RUDE!!!!!!"
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2015-06-26,1,I am a Starbucks partner and love my company but this was the worst Starbucks I've ever gone to. First of all the guy at the register was rude and then he wrote out my first drink wrong and the second drink was purposely made to be disgusting. I watched him talk to the guy at the bar and then the guy at the bar put like seven different syrups in my drink. I will never go back there again.
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2015-01-27,5,"There is another Starbucks right around the corner from this one, next to World Wide Plaza (public seating area). The other one sucks. This one is my favorite Starbucks in the city. The place is super cozy, the employees are always friendly, and if they mess up my drink or take too long to give it to me (which rarely happens) they're always really nice about it and give me a free drink or a larger size."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2014-01-12,3,"If you're right in the centre of the block, you do have a choice of 2 corner Starbucks, which speaks volumes of the amount of traffic here.

Though this one is smaller, a lot actually, it doesn't mean it's cozier lol.  quite loud as the ceilings aren't as high.

closest washroom to use if you're at Carves across the street lol"
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2013-07-19,2,Super slow service and we only ordered iced tea and it took over 15 minutes.  Annoying!
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2012-09-12,1,"The attitudes of some of the staff at this location are shocking. I went in over the weekend and asked for a venti icred coffee with extra ice in a trenta cup. The girl at the register then told me it's against Starbucks policy to sell a venti in a trenta cup and that I'd have to get a trenta. I'll never know if she understood that I was just asking for more ice. And I was a little perplexed that all the other Starbucks I'd been to the NY had made it for me. But I agreed without argument and nevertheless spent the next two minutes while that trenta was being made listening to her and a colleague talking to each other right in front of me about how no other store should be making it for me. When I had to go in again on Sun. because the much better one on 52nd hadn't opened yet, one of the same girls was working the counter. I ordered a trenta - liked she'd told me I had to - and she then proceeded to gossip to a colleague about how ""a cusomter"" - me! - had tried to order a venti in a trenta cup that Fri."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2012-08-14,3,"Hey, hey. What do you know? Another Starbucks next to my apartment. I swear I have like 3 Starbucks' to choose from within a 1-block radius, but each and every one of them are always filled with people. This one is probably one of the larger ones in the area, with seating both inside, and outside in the little square. WiFi works here, which is a plus, and yes, they do serve the same Starbucks that everyone's come to know. 

For seating, there are a bunch of counter seats on one side of the coffee shop, a long table for a communal feel, and then on the other side, some comfy chairs to lounge in. If you want to enjoy the weather outside, there are a ton of seats and tables outside to pick and choose from."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2011-10-08,2,"Ordered a medium green tea latte, was given a large coffee latte instead. Not that I expect much from a Starbucks, but usually they do better."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2011-05-21,3,"A Starbuck's in Hell's Kitchen. Pretty Standard. There's plenty of seating of seating and people tend to hang around working on their laptops. The vibe seems more relaxed here than the nearby Starbuck's locations in Times Square, maybe because of the inter-Avenue location and it's right outside a pedestrian park."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2011-04-05,2,"Just pray that there is never a natural disaster while you are at this Starbucks location.  The quality of the product and the people working here are on par with your normal Starbucks, but the layout was mindboggling!  Imagine a funnel.  Now picture the door to be the small end of that funnel.  That's the store: one extremely narrow entrance with a door that took Herculean strength to open.  It almost felt like a chute for cattle at a feedlot!  

Moo."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2011-04-03,3,"Really, the only thing that makes any difference from Starbucks to Starbucks is the staff. This was my first time into this particular location and the cashier treated me like I was a regular. The two people making the drinks were a little less than speedy....they were too concerned with their own conversation to pay much attention to the growing line, but it was fine all around."
147,starbucks-new-york-148,2009-10-24,2,"A small Starbucks at the corner for those not waiting for a seat at the others in the Times Square area.  The line is relatively fast, and the store is little more than a tight corner, and some standing-high flat tops for you to enjoy your coffee at and look out at the crowds. A place for those who want to avoid the press, too."
148,little-collins-new-york-4,2020-03-16,2,"Beside the cup being the most adorable coffee cup I ever got, coffee was weak. Either the barista gave me decaf or it was just the weakest cup of coffee I ever had to endure. Weaker than Dunkin Donuts!

It was so weak I had the caffeine withdrawal headache at work and I had to go buy another cup of coffee elsewhere because it was not strong enough. 

I don't think I would give this a second chance unless I was getting hot chocolate or a non caffeinated beverage intentionally."
148,little-collins-new-york-4,2020-01-29,4,"I've known there is a Little Collins here for a while. I had some time this morning because the commute went really well, and so I decided to try out the coffee shop. There seems to be occasional morning crowds but they are sparse and I was able to get in my order quickly. The standard small cup is smaller than Starbucks tall size, so be ware. The latte was just perfect and the chocolate croissant likewise, but the drinks are a bit expensive  because of the standard size of the cup. I took a star off for that."
148,little-collins-new-york-4,2020-01-27,3,"I was excited to find this little Aussie place; unfortunately the prices were outrageous. $5 for one piece of toast with butter & vegemite - while delicious - is ridiculously expensive. Having said that, the bread was good, and the ratio of vegemite was better than expected. But I had to buy two to be even remotely satisfied, which means I spent $10 on two pieces of toast, then a hot chocolate which was not at all good for another $5. Definitely not worth it."
148,little-collins-new-york-4,2019-08-20,4,"Macchiatos & cappuccinos are on point, whether you choose dairy or not - love that they use Oatley barista blend oatmilk and Counter Culture beans. If you've never had an affogato, the Hokey Pokey is dangerously addictive (espresso & dessert all in one). The location is convenient but chaotic as it's inside an Urbanspace. Fine if you want your cuppa Joe to go, definitely not a traditional coffee shop though."
148,little-collins-new-york-4,2019-06-15,4,"I'm obsessed with Little Collins. They have fantastic coffee- both espresso and drip. Their avocado toast is absolutely loaded with avocado and toppings and nicely seasoned. The muesli is my favorite item though- a creamy oatmeal-like base with a variety of dried fruits mixed in, topped with jam and fresh berries. 

Docked a star because the location is small compared to the number of people that go there. Food comes out in a timely manner but I wait 10-15 min for my coffee in the morning."
148,little-collins-new-york-4,2019-04-10,5,I just had a great espresso here with great service. Thinking about a second one! Cute corner place with impeccable style.
148,little-collins-new-york-4,2019-04-01,3,Great coffee and snacks.  A bit pricey considering stingy on the napkins and not so :-) service.
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2020-05-13,5,"Amazing Acais! So many options too! Surprisingly, it is easy to screw up an açaí bowl, but playa bowls have master the way to do it. Look no further !"
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2020-02-25,5,"As others have mentioned a bit hard to find at first, but once you get to the club, they will have you sign in and you can go tot he Playa Bowl. The food is great, very fresh and I have been there several times now. In this area, this is the place to go for Acai Bowls."
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2020-02-05,5,Love it right as I order . The delivery guy was on time  I will order again soon. I highly recommend playa bowl
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2019-12-06,4,"Incredibly tasty, fresh and delicious. It's a hard place to find but it is a hidden gem. Staff are usually good and efficient"
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2019-11-07,1,"Jacky is incredibly rude and unprofessional. While their food is fine, I wouldn't waste your time trying to order with them as it constantly takes 45 minutes before they even start making your food"
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2019-09-09,2,Usually really good bowls but today the guy working the store was counting the cash in the register and then preparing food without washing his hands. ‍
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2019-09-01,5,"Another playa bowls added to my list! 

The location was bit hard to find, they are located inside the Mercedes club! 

The service was quick and efficient, the bowls were great and delicious as always!"
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2019-08-21,5,"This is a great spot tucked inside the Mercedes Club. The açaí bowls are all great and the perfect amount of food. Good seating area to sit and enjoy and the staff is all very friendly. The fruit was very fresh and the flavors were great. The ratios of all the ingredients is exactly what I want in a good bowl. 
A little hard to find this spot because it's not clearly marked on the elevator or stairs but you just go up to the 4th floor and ask at the desk . Good times y'all! Good times"
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2019-02-17,5,I've been to Playa Bowls at the Bronxville location and loved it so my friends and I thought we'd try this one in the city. I got my usual green power bowl but this time I decided to split the base and make it half coconut (always wanted to try it). It was a little hard to find at first because you have to go up a bunch of stairs and sign in at the front desk because it is inside of a gym (a very nice one at that!). Overall the staff were pleasant and I really liked the coconut base. The green smoothie blend was a bit melty and usually is a bit better but I still finished and thoroughly enjoyed my bowl. The seating area and the view were really nice so i enjoyed the experience overall.
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2019-01-23,1,"Still giving this location a 1 star. Not sure who was behind the counter today, (12:30p) but she was rude and unprofessional. No ""thank you"" or gratitude... not a personable or friendly bone in her body.  Customer service 101:  you hand someone cash back, not place on counter..  and when you serve you don't slide it on the counter and say ""here ya go""."
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2018-12-02,1,"Half of the time my delivery orders are downright incorrect (or ignored the notes) or have been ""delivered"" to the wrong address.  Never again."
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2018-10-09,3,"This place is a bit confusing to get to. It's inside Mercedes club, upstairs. Go through the entrance (yellow walls) west of the MKT. use the elevator to go to the ""second floor"" or HC floor. If you take the stairs it will take you four flights before you're at the top. 

Once you get to the top floor, walk toward the front desk and then turn around and go straight directly behind you, and you'll hit Playa Bowl. 

There's just one person working but people filing in and out at any given time making it a bit of a wait to get your bowl or smoothie even though there isn't really a line. 

Fruits are fresh and the price is moderate. They have tons of bowls and smoothie options. This is probably convenient if you live in this immediate area and have no other options or if you're already working out in the club, but otherwise I would say get your smoothies and bowls elsewhere."
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2018-10-04,1,Ordered two watermelon salads for $6 each and they literally look and taste like they were cut and packed weeks ago...had to throw both out...
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2018-08-22,1,"I've ordered from here on a handful of occasions because the first and second time were delicious and great. However, in the last few months that I've ordered, it's been completely melted and watery--this has happened for both pick-up and delivery instances. Also, as of recent, I think their bowls have gotten significantly smaller in size so it's definitely not worth the price anymore! So disappointed. I no longer want to take the gamble because I'm not sure what the quality of my bowl will be each time.

Bring back the normal sized bowls, and please remind your employees to put the bowls in the fridge if they're awaiting pick-up! : ("
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2018-08-14,1,No consistency. Nothing is measured. I never know truly how many calories or macros are in what I'm eating unless it's from the pre made section.
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2018-08-11,5,I love their Açaí bowls. They can make them without the honey drizzle. The counter is in my gym so when i am starved after a workout I can grab one easily on the way out.
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2018-07-31,1,"Love the location down at the jersey shore so I thought I'd give this location a try. I always order through seamless, and out of the 5/6 times I've ordered it's only come edible twice. It's either the bowl is melted and spilled all over the bag, or the bowl is missing something. Today's issue is that there's double the amount of granola that should be in the bowl, which makes it completely inedible. Hardly any fruit either. Save yourself the headache, $3.99 delivery fee, and don't order from here."

149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2018-01-26,5,"Found this spot on Yelp after looking for some ""healthier"" options around the west side.  A bit tricky to find.  It's upstairs by the gym.  the Acai bowls are phenomenal.  As the previous yelp reviewer stated, there is a delay in terms of how fast they prepare the order but it is worth it.  Order ahead."
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2017-12-22,5,Conveniently healthy meals by the Mercedes club gym! Great healthy options for a post work out.
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2017-11-19,5,Amazing!! First time at Playa and my server Emmie was so helpful with recommendations. Although I tend to learn towards strawberry and banana flavors she urged me to try the Pumpkin seasonal bowl and it was delicious I highly recommend! (Add the white chocolate drizzle).
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2017-10-30,5,"I'm glad my friend, Belle, told me about this place! After a workout at the Mercedes club, a nice cold pitaya bowl from Playa Bowls really hits the spot. While it may take a while for bowls to be made, it is certainly worth the wait. I can tell that they use the freshest ingredients and do not skimp on the toppings at all. The staff at this location is super friendly as well and makes sure their customers are satisfied. I can't wait to stop by again!"
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2017-10-23,5,"I'm determined to try every bowl from PlayaBowls. Although the service is slow, the bowls are delicious! They're made fresh with either a pitaya, acai, ""green"", banana or coconut base. Then you top it off with either fruits or granola, etc. They're perfect after a great workout! 

Don't judge a book by it's cover because these bowls are super filling!"
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2017-10-09,5,"Stumbled onto this gem after hitting the gym at the club, the bowls are delicious, massive, and beautiful! I ordered the Nutella bowl but each time I come back I try something different. Check out the chia pudding or oatmeal bowls as well, they are amazing. Service is usually pretty fast and everyone is super friendly. Love this place!"
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2017-09-26,5,The employees are really friendly and great at tweaking the bowls exactly how I want them. Way better than the place inside the club before them! Started getting delivery from them now too!
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2017-09-17,1,"The bowls are good. But it took 30 minutes to get one made. And they're not understaffed. The joint just moves at a snail's pace. If the service were faster, this place would be better. Otherwise, it's not worth the time or the $$$"
149,playa-bowls-new-york-2,2017-09-17,1,"Came here on a Sunday and the place was not busy at all. Two of us ordered bowls - the first came out in ten minutes and we waited for another five minutes before asking about the second one. The employee (one of three, the other two were just standing around) informed us that they were missing one ingredient and they were looking for it -- at no point communicating to us that this was the case and informing us that there might be a wait or asking if we'd like something else for the bowl. We informed them that it was fine to make the bowl without the ingredient they were missing, and it still took another ten minutes to get it. All-in, it took us half an hour to get our food, and the first bowl had melted by the time the second one was ready."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2019-11-24,1,"Can you get my order right?
No!

My boyfriend stopped by here one morning to buy a coffee for himself and a mint tea for me. He asked the employees for a peppermint tea and when he arrived back at the hotel, I noticed they had given him a black tea instead. As someone who doesn't really drink black tea, I was really disappointed and I threw it in the trash. 

On other news, my boyfriend enjoyed his coffee. He said it was pretty average.

Would we return?
It's not likely."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2019-08-15,1,"My neighbor and I went there and the guy who made the croissant special was wearing gloves. He then pushed the large garbage can out of his way and then grabbed two croissants for her meal without changing gloves. She then told the front desk women what happened, One was rude  and the other apologized and remade the croissants. Then she stood there while the other girl made nasty comments about her in a language my friend understood. Then they made her pay for it! After waiting 20 minutes and being made nauseous by this old, disgusting man! She reported this to Dunkin Donuts and they had the District Mgr contact her today. He said the old man who put his hands on the garbage can lied and said my friend was lying and he never touched it but the Mgr said he watched him do it on the videotape. The Mgr never offered her anything so she said ""Don't you feel you should offer me something for all of this?"" He said ""You can have a coffee"". She said (because I was right there), ""Do you think they should have taken $ after what they did? He yelled ""What do you want? EVERYTHING!?"" Can you possibly imagine the ignorance of this fool? They wanted to serve her bacteria laden croissants and the guy didn't do a thing for her? If that is what they do when a customer is standing right there looking at them in the back of the store, what do these people do when you are not looking? The staff at DD typically are awful, but they have hit ""a new low"" now. You might as well rub the croissants on the floor and then serve them. They probably do that here before customers arrive. They may use them to clean the bathroom floors. That is exactly what they did effectively when he transferred trash and bacteria from his gloves to her croissants [which he touched with both hands]. How disturbing and disgusting!! 

It is all GMO food anyway and the worst ingredients which make you sick. Better to keep away from croissants / coffee / EVERYTHING at DD if you want to live a long and healthy life.

KEEP AWAY!  DISGUSTING. MGMT IS EVEN MORE STUPID THAN THE EMPLOYEES.  THEIR MGR SEEMS TO THINK HE IS HEADING UP THE FOUR SEASONS instead of a dirty, dingy, filthy store with people who have no concern for their customers' health or cleanliness."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2017-10-17,1,"This is the worst Dunkin I have ever been to and it has everything to do with the staff.  The staff is rude and unfriendly.  I was standing right in front of the cashier waiting to pay and she looked past me and said ""NEXT!"" ... i kindly said ""small hot coffee"" and she looked at me as if I were an alien.  I then followed up with ""I haven't paid yet"" which was met with a dirty look.  I will NOT being going back to this location - EVER."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2016-09-01,4,"Been here nearly every day and I love it. The food I'd lovely and the coffee is absolutely delicious. There coffee is no different to starbucks, so why 3 times more for something you can get cheaper and better.

The staff aren't the best, but are pleasant enough. They do get orders wrong and it's hard to explain what you want, but that's just the language barrier. DD shouldn't be let down bcoz of their staff.

Great donuts!!"
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2016-07-06,5,"Walked down there 2  mornings to grab breakfast, coffee & iced tea to go in the morning while staying at the Manhattan Club July 3rd - 5th. Very neat clean & competent employees. Definitely will go back to this location when staying at the Manhattan Club again and went in the area in the city."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2015-10-04,3,Solid midtown Baskin / DD location not far from the Park.
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2015-04-27,3,Location is convenient. Didn't stop by for coffee or donuts. Just came in to grab a bottle of soda which was over $2. Steep but I guess not bad for where its located.
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2015-02-22,4,My favorite Dunkin in NYC.  Go there a few times a week and their staff is so nice and friendly.  They know what I'm getting when I walk in and often throw in a couple free donuts with my coffee.
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2014-10-28,1,"Gross service and unclean. Visited here a few weeks ago; asked the server if my coffee had sugar in it. He progressed to lick his finger, dipped his finger into the coffee, pulled it out and re-licked it. He yelled ""no sugar"" then handed me my coffee.  

I told him to repour it."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2014-09-15,1,"I hate this location. They always screw up my order in one way or another its ridiculous, they'd rather focus on getting you to buy that one extra doughnut just to up sell. They will almost argue with you to buy it. I got so sick of them asking me over and over again every time I come to this location. I finally told them off. Now they know  not to bother me with it."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2014-07-29,3,"I am here at least twice a week for my morning cup of joe. I'm a big fan of stocking up on the gift books they sell at the holidays where you get a book of 10 coupons for a large hot coffee for $12. You save a lot of money that way. 
It's a really small location, so if there's a line I won't go in because it becomes chaos. You know, it's DD. They have coffee and donuts, bagels, muffins, breakfast sandwiches, etc. Recently there has been a lot of turnover in staff and it's pretty obvious that the cashiers are still learning.
In the back is the Baskin Robbins, and we always get our ice cream cakes here to celebrate birthdays at the office. They will write whatever you want on top of the cake, as long as you spell it out slowly for them. It's best to go pick the cake up yourself because delivery can be irregular."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2013-11-09,4,The service here is good.  Just keep in mind that if youre coming during rush hours don't expect an in and out scenario. The coffee is done right and I've never have a problem with the sandwich's.  The staff is friendlier once you're a regular. They have your coffee ready as soon as they see you and are all smiles.   Its actually a great group of people working at this location.  The space is a bit small.
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2013-08-18,3,"Probably the best coffee of the big chains together with McDonald. Their baked goods could be better. Also not enough choice of milk for coffee, they should at least have some almond milk for lactose intolerant people."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2013-01-07,3,"My first time at a Dunkin Donuts, but apparently they're everywhere!  Great prices, but atmosphere is cramped and dingy inside.  Wouldn't mind getting take-out from here if I'm in a rush for a quick fix, but if you're looking for a caffeine fix, you'd better add a ""turbo shot"" of espresso, as their coffee is pretty watery!"
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2012-10-13,5,"All employees here super friendly! They will make your coffee exactly like u want. Few times I returned, but they never said no if I asked to change it. They are really trying their best to satisfy you:) 
And it is always clean there."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2012-04-23,3,"This has been a staple coffee shop for me for the past two years.  I have come to know the Team that works there during the day and they recognize me, know what I want and are super friendly once they get to know you.  The lines are long at key times of the day but it moves quickly.  

The location is clean and well organized.  The Baskin Robins is in the back and Dunkin Donuts is in the front."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2012-03-21,1,"Asked for cream for my coffee; cream came out of package with a huge blob of mold in it. I took it back to the counter and they gave me a new coffee with little comment, as if this wasn't all that uncommon. I guess the replacement coffee has to be enough, but I feel pretty strongly that mold in cream should =  refund. My stomach is still churning. Ugh."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2011-08-26,3,"This is a small dunkin donuts and cashiers were typically unfriendly ""what do you want?"" pay us and get movin' type of service but hey what did you expect.

However it is nice that they actually have a baskin robins section in the back, what a throw back!"
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2011-05-12,5,"Good place,. Fast service and the food is pretty good for a place that is not really a kitchen like McD's or BK. 

Went here a few times during my stay in NYC."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2010-08-02,1,"I know how I like my coffee and tea.. don't tell me how I like my coffee and tea.  Dunkin Donuts was having their 99 cent iced tea special and I asked for some skim milk with my tea.  This is not uncommon so I'm not sure why I received the ""you wont like it that way"" response.  After a back and forth exchange.. they grudgingly added some milk to it.  Then when I try to pay with a $50 bill... they tried not to accept it.  That's all I had, what do you want from me.  Stop wasting my time... I want to enjoy my coffee breaks not argue 10 minutes over how I like my tea and what denomination bills I have in my wallet."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2010-06-18,3,"To my mind, there is absolutely nothing remarkable about this particular Baskin Robbins/ Dunkin Donuts (not like, say, the one in Carroll Gardens with the amazing patio).  Nope. Just a tiny, skinny little space, with coffee up front, ice cream in the back.  I always know what to expect. 

Anyway, I like ice cream. I work a block away. It's on the way back to my office from Certe, where I eat quite a lot.  Again, there's nothing to distinguish this Baskin Robbins from any other.  Service is the typical apathetic,  occasionally mildly incompetent, but never frustratingly so standard that I've found one encounters at most BRs.  I never go here for coffee, so I don't know how they are in the morning, but they are perfectly capable of scooping ice cream.  Although sometimes they don't really push it in, and I've almost lost my scoop, but I'm a very experienced ice cream eater, so that's thankfully never happened.

So, if, say, you're exhausted from a scintillating and mind-expanding trip through MoMA, and would like some cheap ice cream, this BR is your best bet. (OK, there's gelato in the sculpture garden in the summer, but sometimes, all you really want is some bathroom-tile-colored mint chocolate chip)."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2010-05-16,3,"Been somewhat a weekend regular here and since I've started rating on Yelp!, decided to do here as well.

While it's a good place, the B & R placement is a little inefficient.  Can't complain, the architecture's at fault here, not the place.

The staff's friendly (most of the time) so that's another plus.

So then why 3 out of 5 stars?  Easy, the Tuna Cheddar Sandwich.

Saw a sign outside saying they served it, and so I went into order a new item.

Ever tried a tuna sandwich with a RAISIN BAGEL?

Upon ordering, getting, and checking (ALWAYS CHECK your ""To GO"" orders at fast food, they make mistakes from time to time).

So seeing it's w/ a raisin bagel they're making the order with, I ask the employee to not make it with Raisin Bagels and instead a regular one.

Zoom, the bagel's cut in half and filled with the tuna at the fastest speed I have ever seen a DD employee move.

The employee then turns around and looks at me, tells me that since my order had been made already I can only get a regular bagel tuna by ordering another.

Really?  Wow...

But what's this?  The manager/head comes over and berates the employee (saying I am a regular here), apologizes and tells the employee to give me 2 donuts free of charge to compensate.

Got a Boston Creme and Jelly Donut, but they were both stale and a little ""squeezed"".

Not coming when that particular employee's there making the food/coffee.

Otherwise a great place."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2010-02-19,4,"First of all I am a Starbucks addict...and having 2 on the same block can get pretty pricey. So when walking to work I have decided to get my morning latte's from DD's. SUPRISE SUPRISE the taste at this location is actually pretty good and the coffee doesn't taste burnt like the usual. This location is good and the line moves fast in the morning so I'm a happy ""saving a few bucks a day on my morning coffee addiction"" camper! Still going to Starbucks for my Frapps though...sorry DD's your flozen beverages taste like syrup crap."
150,dunkin-new-york-148,2009-03-23,4,"Ladies and Gentleman,
Please contain your excitement and do not stand up until we come to a complete stop.
For today I present to you---
a Dunkin Donuts review?
Yeah Dunkin Donuts.
Upon hearing many negatives about various Dunkin Donuts locations I felt obligated to inform you of a pretty decent one.
In the year or so since it's been open I have been here 2-3 times a week. Yes 2-3 times a week.
Healthy? Probably not.
But it's cheap and fairly consistent. I'm mostly there in the mornings and the coffee has been fresh and donuts never stale. My non-coffee consuming colleagues seem to love the hot chocolate. I've even consumed their breakfast sandwiches a few times and can't complain. It's nothing dazzling but not bad. Definitely better than what a McD or other fast food establishment would serve.
The morning rush gets pretty busy, but service has always been very polite and usually pretty quick. The store itself is small so while the line may seem intimidating, I'm usually in and out in less than 5 minutes. The only delays I've experienced have been caused by customers not staff. Either the person with unusually large order or the people can't figure out what they want ( I always wonder what were they thinking in line the last 2 minutes?)."
151,primos-cafe-breakfast-cart-manhattan,2015-11-25,5,"Hands down this is the best Breakfast Cart in Midtown. They serve Chorizo! I'm talking about Chorizo! Lol! Everything is cooked fresh while you wait, phenomenal customer service. I recommend this is you ever want a good fat boy breakfast!"
151,primos-cafe-breakfast-cart-manhattan,2015-09-03,5,"Cheap, tasty, hot, filling breakfast wraps. I'm hooked.

Stopped by here when the Eggstravaganza truck was missing this morning. Fast service, popular place.

[ food ] 
A variety of breakfast wraps, omelette platters with home fries, and classic pastries and bagels. 

I got a vegetarian breakfast wrap for $4.50. It was the perfect amount of food without sending me into a chipotle-style coma. Arrives almost too hot to eat, will definitely still be hot when it gets back to your desk.

Can choose to add salt, pepper, ketchup, or hot sauce.

Great value! A morning staple and a great price for the midtown work district."
151,primos-cafe-breakfast-cart-manhattan,2014-01-15,4,"One of the best bacon, egg and cheese bagels I have found in midtown.  They keep the eggs somewhat whole, a mix between fried and scrambled eggs and the bagel was still in good shape.  Most usually seem to become soaked in grease or soggy by a short walk to my desk. This bagel still had a good crust and the breading wasn't overloaded with grease from the grill, just enough to give some flavor.  

This cart still has a tough time with Eggs Travaganza on the north side of the block and all of their different options.  This was also the most expensive sandwich I have tried in midtown at $3.50 with Eggs Travaganza offering the same sandwich for $3.00.  Overall a nice place to visit and stop by for something to start your morning."
151,primos-cafe-breakfast-cart-manhattan,2013-04-22,5,"You haven't  had breakfast, until you visit this cart. Try the Primos grilled cheese, or the Mexican wrap with cheese, you can't go wrong. Excellent service, and i almost forgot about the coffee... Best cup of joe on park avenue."
151,primos-cafe-breakfast-cart-manhattan,2013-01-14,3,I had order a Bagel with cream cheese & Coffee...it's was ok...
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2019-09-20,1,"This place is horrible. The staff are so rude. Their customer service is terrible. He was coughing all over the donut it was disgusting. I asked for an ice latte and the guy told me ""no I already cleaned the machine"" they close at 10pm and it was 8:50pm. Please avoid this place."
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2019-09-20,1,DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION!!  The service is horrible. No one knows what they are doing. I've been here twice this week- ordered something and they forgot to make it. Worst customer service. And didn't apologize. It is also a very dirty location. Do not waste your money here.
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2018-04-09,5,Not all chains are the same and this is one of the better Dunkin'. The staff has excellent customer service and are super quick to get orders out during the morning rush. The coffee is made perfectly every time.
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2018-03-29,5,"Every time I come here, it's ALWAYS Excellent service and always such a friendly and profess atmosphere. I always look forward to seeing my guys Tarikul and Ashan. They always greet me and prepare my food and drinks to perfection. Better than other Dunkin Donut locations I've been at. Thanks for the awesome interactions and both you guys rock."
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2017-03-31,4,"This Dunkin' Donuts is a solid choice. Located on Lexington Ave close to everything.  I always choose Dunkin over Starbucks. I'm a tea drinker. When I'm in a hurry or just want to grab a quick cup I go to Dunkin. 

It was raining out and I wanted a cup of tea to take back with me. The service was quick. I just ordered a med hot tea milk and sugar. There was seating inside of the location. They also had food on there menu. I just stick with the tea. The girl behind the counter spoke English. I know that sounds horrible. But some other locations in the city it's hit or miss. 

This location is close to everything. I would recommend coming to This DD if you are in the area. It's ether here or the location on 3rd."
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2016-08-10,3,"It's fine. Hot food was made like usual.  I can see it being really cramped during peak hours.  Staff were friendly.  Only a wee order hiccup, which was immediately rectified.  And they have seating, which is nice!

Quasi-suburban feel in the city!"
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2016-07-27,5,"The best Dunkin Donuts in the city. Management and staff is a pleasure, always smiling and eager to please! They brighten my day every time I go in. Oh yeah the ice coffee is pretty damn good as well."
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2016-07-20,1,"I walk in to order a few munchkins for myself and coworkers, and 3 separate people asked me for my order in about 15 seconds. Even as I let people pass me, and stood aside. 

Looking at the menu I saw that 10 munchkins is $2.49 and 25 is $6.99. 

Thanks to my public education I realized that at the 10 ct rate, 25 munchkins would cost $6.23. So the 30 munchkins would be better deal ($7.47). I chose to go with 20 munchkins and let them know of the discrepancy. They put all 20 munchkins uncovered in a brown bag, and had no other reply. 

I'll eat the uncovered donuts because I'm kind of a pig, but I think it's in poor taste. 

Tl;dr. Don't fall for the 25ct combo. Buy in multiples of 10. And watch out for loose donuts."
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2015-06-03,4,"Fast, speedy, and polite staff. Lol fast and speedy are the same thing sorry.

This is a pretty busy DD and they are quick and nice to everyone. They pretty much know my order which is just a medium iced coffee. They never put too much milk or sugar so I dont have to worry about DIABEETUS like I do at some other DD.

Anyway, it's Dunkin Donuts. They all have the same menu. I am pleased with the service here so I'll keep coming back when I need my coffee fix."
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2014-11-01,3,"it is what it is folks,typical dd layout ,clean place and donut and bagel selection fair enough .got a veggie egg white flat sandwich not bad and some donuts for the vultures at the job. not a bad dd if you are in area .and the morning crew always seem upbeat,and prices Are ok. MORNING time is the best for fresh stuff."
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2013-10-17,4,Best location for DD - friendly staff and make my coffee perfectly the way I want it. I only go to this location now.
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2012-06-22,4,"I came here several times when I was in New York.

The 2nd day that I was there, we ordered the bagel with the cheese, bacon, and eggs toasted. So as our order came out, the guy only gave us a toasted plain bagel with cream cheese on the side. He must've hit his head or something, because the next employee kept telling him he forgot the eggs, bacon, and cheese. So then he completely messed it up by just not even making the cheese and eggs cook together. SMH at you sir!

Anyways, the line gets lengthy."
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2012-03-13,4,"Midtown East serves generic mass produced breakfast efficiency yet robotic motions.  It's Dunkin' Donuts--nothing more, nothing less.

One order of toasted plain bagel with ham and cheese at $3.59 was average.  This tea drinker came here to sustain substance on-the-go.  Four stars as the cashier were going to dope my change from a $5.00 and abandon my request for a sales receipt to eradicate me in assisting the next patron."
152,dunkin-new-york-66,2010-12-23,3,"It's Dunkin Donuts, yo.  Not much to review.  I prefer their coffee to Starbucks, although don't like that I they put the half-and-half in.  Would rather do it myself.

The donuts, well, it's Dunkin Donuts, yo.  Don't need me to tell you they're good.  I go old-school with a Chocolate Honey-Dipped (you kids call it the Chocolate Glazed), with either a Whole Wheat or a Blueberry."
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2020-05-03,4,"The best fresh food, that's always good, love there lentil soup, and there fresh salad that change up a lot. Only problem is they are on the pricey side."
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2020-01-06,1,Stale bread and the soy milk was clumpy. Nasty.  I don't understand how a place like this can survive.

153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2017-11-06,5,"Love this Pret location because employees are so kind and helpful.  Definitely had my fair share of free coffee and one time free Mac n Cheese just because I mentioned that I had never tried it - so they were kind enough to give it to me on the house :) 

Pret does not have a traditional loyalty program and do reward you with the occasional Pret employee stepping up to pay for your meal/coffee.  They are great.  I never had any issues with this location and find that they are fairly well stocked for all the basic offerings depending on when you go.

It's too small to sit/work at, and definitely more grab n' go than other locations."
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2017-11-03,1,"Worst service ever - putting food and soups in wrong containers, they couldn't care less, rushing through customers."
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2017-05-12,4,"I popped into this Pret location with my dear colleague, Jill, to grab a late lunch.  I always love their warm wraps because they clearly use great ingredients and cheeses.  I ESPECIALLY love their meatball wrap...which brings me to why I'm writing this review.  

When I walked in, I went straight for the warm wrap department, and what I found was extremely disappointing: where were the meatball wraps?  I grabbed a replacement option and headed to the counter to ask for a chocolate chip cookie (they keep their pastries warmed in the glass case) and to ask what happened to the meatball sandwiches.  

I was told by a very lovely associate that they no longer carry it as of last Friday.  DEVASTATED, I asked why and none of them could tell me.  In fact, we commiserated over the loss together.  Me and the four or five other people behind the counter bonded because of the loss of such a dear sandwich.  

All of that being said, the staff here are INCREDIBLY nice.  In fact, in every Pret I've been to, I've always been struck by the level of professionalism and kindness I've encountered.  Someone's nailing that.  

This particular Pret is on the smaller side, so don't go here looking for a place to sit comfortably and read or write a novel.  

Jill and I will be back...and I'll keep trying other sandwiches in hopes that I find something I love as much as the meatball."
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2017-04-28,4,"There are many better Pret locations in the city, but this review is about their new veggie menu items rollout (April 2017).

***LOCATION & INTERIOR***
This Pret is pretty small, but the location in midtown is great. Despite the size, it still carries all (or most?) of the food found at larger locations. 

There's almost no seating with just a bar along one section of the window, but Pret is grab-and-go so you'll probably be able to get a seat if you want one. It's loud and hectic though because people are constantly going in and out, so not the best place to rest or get work done.

***FOOD***
Now for the new veggie menu YAY! The campaign is accompanied by a #notjustforveggies hashtag, meaning the food is so good that even non-vegetarians/vegans will like them.

And I totally agree. The new rollout includes balance boxes (think macro bowls), ""pots"" (think small sides you would get at a restaurant), wraps, banh mis/baguettes, drinks, and more. I haven't had a chance to try most of the food yet, but have heard good things from people who went to the one-day veggie pret pop up the weekend before the menu launch. Pret has done a good job of creating items for diverse tastes and inspired by diverse cultures. 

So far, I've tried 2 of their most popular new vegan items--the miso sweet potato banh mi (Vietnamese-inspired) and the chakalaka wrap (South African-inspired). The banh mi was my favorite, and at $7.49 for a huge sandwich it's very reasonably priced for a midtown lunch. After toasting it a few minutes back at my office, I had a perfectly crispy baguette (more of a western baguette than the traditional banh mi kind) stuffed with caramelized sweet potatoes and really yummy, colorful pickled veggies. So good. The chakalaka wrap is also very flavorful, and it was fun to try something I've never had before. 

Both items were pretty filling (according to the webstie, they're only 480 and 360 cals, respectively), making for convenient lunches that'll get you through a busy afternoon.

***NOTES/RECOMMENDATION***
The new veggie items are definitely worth a try! Hopefully in the future NYC will open a full Veggie Pret like the one in the UK. :)"
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2016-05-06,3,Decent salads and friendly staff. Good place to quickly pick up something pre-made. Selection of salads could be better.
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2016-04-05,2,I go to Pret every day for lunch and get myself a salad. Yesturday I decided to pick up Pret on my way home. I ended up in this one. This is the smallest pret with the most unprofessional staff . The male cashier asked me if he could sit with me and I told him no and then he proceeded to tell me that he will be going on break soon and will be sitting with me. I never met this man before and I do not know why he felt the need to be so wierd. I will never go back to this Pret again and I suggest the managers check who they hire.
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2016-01-08,1,"I am not reviewing the food or the parent co which I enjoy & appreciate . I am reviewing this location only. This Pret is on East 51st street near Park Ave. 
I've been a regular early morning customer here, but not after today.  Recently the volume on the sound system has become excessive and this morning when I asked for it to be lowered because I could not here my own mobile phone through my ear buds, I was told the volume is not adjustable. Since the volume was never this loud until the past 2 weeks, that seems unlikely. 
I know it is a small shop and you need turnover,  but your patrons should be able to spend 10-15 for breakfast in a pleasant place.
GO TO A Different Pret location, there are several in the area! I know I will. 
BTW, I tried to find Pret's comment card and box, but this location does not have one available to customers."
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2015-11-04,4,"Sneaking out of office to grab a quick coffee at Pret. For coffee, Pret has had nothing special; however for juices or lunch selections, definitely a decent place.

Would come back for a wrap or soup next time during lunch hours. They also had plenty of space inside the store."
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2014-08-06,5,"My favorite Pret in the city. Customer service is spot on here. Employees are always cheerful and smiling.

Cheap and good coffee too."
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2014-01-22,2,"Usually I love Pret, but this location isn't great. It's got less choices and the space isn't used very wisely. My sandwich didn't seem to be made with the same usual care, all the meat was in one big pile at the top.  The staff was really nice though."
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2013-06-07,4,"A nice option right next to my workplace!
They're a little pricey ($7 for a sandwich, $5 for a cup of soup) but the food is GOOD.

This location just opened up last month.  Not a lot of tables, but I think they're more focused on the midtown lunch rush hour.  There are 6 cashiers, and service is fast and friendly. 

Good selection of salads, sandwiches, soups, grilled cheese, pastries, beverages.
My favorites:  Mozareella brie basil baguette, white bean escarole soup, egg salad sandwiches
Must haves: the brownies, the ginger soda (if you like that peppery ginger flavor!  it's strong and delicious!)"
153,pret-a-manger-new-york-45,2013-05-30,1,"Pret used to be my go to place when I don't know what to eat for lunch.  I was so excited when I found out about this location since it is only a block away from my office.  I liked that it is more spacious than the 400 Park one.  
 
I got the chicken, avocado, cranberries and walnut salad and found a bug or a beetles thingy on the bottom of the brown box when I was half way done with my salad. It looked nothing like a dried cranberry.  It was so gross.  I threw it out as soon as possible.  Wish I took a picture of it.  I was really disappointed with Pret (with the $ that Pret is charging and the portion we are getting, i expect more).

I wish i can give a 0 star."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2019-12-23,3,"Its average, small, with hit or miss service. Barista was good. Not a lot of enthusiasm with service and floor was dirty. Eh....."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2019-11-04,1,"this has the be the worst starbucks in nyc...slow. rude. always dirty. who is in charge here?!? does anyone at starbucks read these revi

starbucks are you listening!!!???!!! this place needs a complete overhaul asap! dirty, old looking, and the employees are just not up to par! i hope you fix things fast! 

update: this continues to be the worst starbucks in nyc! always slow. mobile ordering always has a wait! rude rude staff!"
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2019-08-23,1,"If the barista hits on you and you reject him he'll take extra long with your drink. Mine got on his phone and ignored my order after I paid. 

Ordered my drink without ice, got my cup filled to the very top with ice. He struggled to put the lid on, that's how MUCH ice he put. 

Get my drink wrong everytime and they procrastinate and chit chat. 

Not worth it. Walk down 3rd ave to the Starbucks on 63r"
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2019-06-02,1,"I was appalled. I started to order a drink and got interrupted as the cashier started up a conversation with the other cashier. Then when it finally came around to ordering the cashier appeared very rude and I had to keep repeating my drink because she wasn't getting the right thing (coffee crap with soy, not hard). Then a worker started hitting on me and when I just appeared uninterested he had an attitude, and I saw him do this with several other females. Finally when my drink came it was the wrong order."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2019-04-04,1,"Truly the worst Starbucks I've ever frequented. The staff is remarkably rude, slow, and sour. Not a happy place."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2018-09-27,5,"These guys always work so hard and the service is always so nice. They didn't have an ingredient for the sandwich I ordered so they asked if I wanted to change and then gave me a free cake pop for the wait! Not a lot of space in the store and generally a lot of people so not a great spot to do work, but great service there."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2018-07-30,5,"Total fan of Starbucks. I am a shameless total Starbuck junkie...

These strawberry cake pops are so cute, we love them...but they do not taste like strawberries. Maybe like strawberry Nesquik powder mixed in with cake batter...still good.

Starbucks has streamlined their drink menu to a T...and seldom do they ever get my drinks wrong. In fact, I can tell them exactly how many pumps of syrup or ounces of java/tea to get my perfect ratio. They enter my request either on a sticker or just tick off their green boxes. Always perfect. Their limited seasonal offerings are also awesome.

Sbux provides great on the go coffee. They are on almost every block in the city...so much love!! 

But when in Queens....Dunkin' Donuts is the way with their awesome drive thru. Still prefer SBux over DD any day.

Thanks for being such superstars when it comes to mixing teas and coffees."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2018-06-12,1,$4 for grounds in my coffee and staff who made me wait to take my order even though there was zero line? No thank you.
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2018-05-09,2,"No bathroom (it is closed!), they put the straws for the drinks out of reach, and the door has a weird metal thing sticking out that scrapes up your leg when you exit. The iced caramel macchiato was pretty good though."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2018-05-09,1,"I've given this site so many chances and every time they let me down. 
I only come here because it's close to my school and I'd rather go to the 63rd location where the staff to the coffee is consistent. 
This location though. Damn. 
The employees are always looking like they don't wanna be there. They always mess up your order and when asked to make it right, they will not change the entire drink but make minute alterations to it. For eg. I got an iced americano with light soy milk. This guy poured soy milk so much that I was basically drinking an iced. latte and I hate that milky taste. I told him that and you know what he did? He simply took my drink and poured water in it and ice. 

Now the drink went from a latte to a watered down, filthy tasting latte/americano? I didn't wanna create a fuss since I was running late. I tried drinking it and man, I had to trash the whole thing. 

Thing is. Don't ever come here unless it's absolutely necessary. I make that long walk to 63 and lex rather than waste my money and energy in this location."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2018-03-10,1,"This was quite possibly the least customer focused experience I've ever had in a Starbucks. The barista was rude to her coworkers and the customers. The Starbucks model is one of efficiency, great customer service, and consistency. This location FAILS in every one possible."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2018-01-15,1,Winter time and this place is cold inside and the heating system is blowing cold air. I got a cappuccino and chocolate croissant. The cappuccino tasted like water and the croissant was not warm enough and appeared to be a few days old. It was very disappointing.
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2017-11-28,1,"Blew it on my order but couldn't manage an apology or a even a smile after my ridiculously long wait. Couldn't care less about their customers. Get some decent workers who don't have that cold, angry attitude. I'll spend my $5 a day somewhere else. These workers are the reason retail shops are dying."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2017-10-01,3,"This is a typical Starbucks, it's a bit small. If there's a long line it does take a while to actually get served. Slower than other Starbucks I have been to. The staff still is very friendly and the product is what you expect from Starbucks."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2017-09-23,2,"My regular barista isn't here today. So I just got a salad and my cashier was Micheal. He approached me with no greetings and cold blank face. So I tried to have a conversation and smile at him, hoping he will smile or cheer up from that cold blank face. Nah, he didn't. His energy was so negative, I felt super uncomfortable. All his answers are short with low and negative energy. He is like ""what u want?"" ""thats it?"" ""no"" ""no bag"" ""take it"". I have a big personality, so if I feel uncomfortable and something situation like this, I would create a big scene, but i aint got time today so I got my salad n left. I don't usually write reviews for starbucks but this one I have to because customer service is something you can learn and improve up on. i'm definitely coming back!"
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2017-09-18,2,"I used to love this Starbucks location, but something has changed. The staff used to be happy and upbeat. You used to get your order with a smile and some really good music was always playing.

My last four visits here (Yes-I am a regular) have been sub par. Specifically last weekend I waited my turn in line and when I was next I walked in front of the team member to order and he immediately started texting on his phone. He didn't look at me and I said nothing. I wanted to see how long he would do this. And I waited.....and waited....until about one minute + later he looked up and said ""Sorry man, what can I get you.""  

NOT WHAT I EXPECT FROM STARBUCKS!

This past weekend I ordered a bold coffee and a sandwich. The team member asked my name and I spelled MARK for him. I received my coffee (awesome as usual) and sat at a window seat to wait for my sandwich. And I waited....and waited... After 7-8 minutes I walked up to a team member who was at the food case. I asked her about my sandwich. She had a blank look on her face then turned around and took a receipt off a machine (which had been sitting there for 7-8 minutes). She looked at me and said ""Mary?"" I said ""Ummm, no, I'm not Mary - I'm Mark"" I explained to her that he must have input the name wrong (unless he meant to call me Mary, which is totally possible). She then said ""Sorry about that but we are also out of that sandwich."" WHAT??!!  Okay, so I asked and received a refund for the sandwich but what a waste of time and effort. I did expect her to at least buy my tall coffee as well because of the many errors but nothing was said. Just a swipe of my Starbucks Gold Card for the credit and handed my card back to me.

NOT WHAT I EXPECT FROM STARBUCKS!

Looks like I will have to find my new favorite Starbucks on the east side."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2017-07-28,1,"Constantly making my drinks wrong. Staff ignores you. Recently I left something here and realized it a couple of hours later, I called several times over the next few days but no one picks up. I also stopped by but the staff tells me I have to speak to a manager- on multiple occasions, I waited almost 20 min but manager never showed up so I just left."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2017-07-17,2,"Every single time I've gone here, something is wrong with my order. I've given it two stars instead of one for their service recovery. However, I use the mobile app as I'm frequently in a rush and having to wait for a manager to either refund me or give me a gift card takes far too long. I'll be using a different location from now on."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2017-06-05,5,"Great Starbucks! I'm glad to see they have the nitro cold brew! The staff is very friendly, fast & efficient. I always walk to this one even if another is closer because they have plenty of seating."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2017-05-21,4,"Friendly service and a decent, moderate amount of seating - busy at the counter but plenty of seats at 10:30 on a Sunday morning."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2017-02-27,3,"As previous yelpers have stated, I have mixed feelings about this place. Sometimes I would be able to get my drink/food really quick, somethings not so much. I mobile order majority of the time to ""cut"" down the wait time but now I think waiting on line here is actually quicker. They don't always look at the machine for mobile orders so they won't even have your drink ready. I came one evening to pick up my mobile order before heading to class so I was waiting at the drink pick up area but then I was redirected by one of the baristas standing around telling me to step down and order. I had to repeat myself twice to him that I had already ordered and only the second time he heard what I said and I was speaking pretty loudly too. Their music was very loud though however..... Finally after he heard me say ""mobile order"" he went over and got the sticker to the cup and the prepared my drink. Another time I came in, I ordered at the register and sometimes it would be quick but this time it was not. I waited for my food, that was quickly heated and then my drink... forget about it. It took so long to make it. I ordered the strawberry acai refresher with coconut milk, also popularly known as the pink drink. Someone previously had ordered it before me and I saw how they made theirs, but for me? Differently. I've ordered this drink numerous amounts of times so I know exactly what goes in there and what doesn't. The previous person's order was made with the strawberry part and then topped with coconut milk, mine? It was made with the strawberry part, WATER and then topped off with a drip of coconut milk. Was it good? No. Was it worth the money? Definitely not. I will just stick to other drinks from this location. Most of the time, the taste is inconsistent based on who is making the drinks."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-11-25,3,"I have mixed feelings about this Starbucks. Sometimes they are moody and make crappy coffee and other times its pretty awesome. I wont complain too much because I do stroll in at 6:30 AM, buuuuuuut this is a coffee shop after all :) I'm also paying a lot more than I would at Dunkin' Donuts, for good coffee nonetheless, but slightly better service would be much appreciated."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-09-27,1,"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SERVICE. waited 25 minutes for a disgusting drink and had my drink messed up three times. they attempted to make it up by offering the messed up drinks ""on the house"" and pushing it in my direction, and when they saw i didn't want it, they rushed my drink and it tasted like absolute shit. i am so disappointed and discouraged and to be honest DONT COME HERE IF YOU DONT WANT SHITTY SERVICE. GO TO DUNKIN OR ANOTHER LOCATION. I WANT MY 6 DOLLARS BACK."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-09-25,2,"The restroom was out of service but it was not true.
When people asked for code for restroom, they said it is out of service.
But I saw that Starbucks' employee just goes into bathroom and using it very sneakingly.
Why do they lie to people?????
They also rude when they got order and make loud giggling sound for themselves."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-09-20,1,Worst Starbucks ever!!! All the drinks I've ordered from there have been terribly made. The Frappuccino was literally a chunk of ice and the teavana iced tea drinks are disgusting. The workers are under trained and make horrible drinks.
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-08-18,2,Yelitza is apparently the supervisor but couldn't care any less about her job or customers watching her push their orders aside while she helps the register w 2 patrons! Thankfully the other barista (didn't get her name) was able to pick up the slack  if you're in a rush try another branch.
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-08-10,2,"Dear Starbucks manager at this location,

Please clean the bathroom... Whether it's a dirty diaper with poop or used paper towels, please have your staff check the bathroom trash can at least once every hour so that the bathroom doesn't smell like feces and the floor around the toilet area doesn't have pee drops.... I almost liked after drinking a delicious Teavanna lemonade.... Please and thank you...."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-07-26,3,"The wait was long for a fast environment  like the lower east side. 
Average customer service. Calm and clean ambience, Would give it another chance because they literally just opened when I came. 

(Convenient location  for The new  MTA train station for the Q. They would have to step up there game a little on wait time)"
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-06-28,1,Been here 3 times in one week and 2 out of 3 times they got my order wrong... Probably because the cashier visibly does not listen as you order but that's just a guess. So annoying. Shouldn't have to pay $4+ for the wrong drink.
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-06-25,1,"Yelp made me give a star..... No stars what-so-ever though. I cannot believe the manager here. Im speaking for another customer too. The so-called manager here has an attitude that should get her fired. Customer was waiting for her drink, and mentioned that the milk poured in was not non-fat. The worker who proclaimed to be the manager said she could have said something earlier, but come-on... your job is to know what drink you are making. Literally gave the worst attitude, and began to ignore the customer by humming. STARBUCKS really needs to work on training their employees, and screening them. Please walk a few blocks more to find another Starbucks, and not have your day ruined."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-06-20,5,Sure barista could've been friendlier but I don't think there's ever a Starbucks that I didn't like. I love the free wifi and phone charge here. The atmosphere is laid back and I can sit here waiting on my own thoughts- definitely a plus
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-03-25,1,Very disappointed with service. Took way too long to make an espresso shot. Workers on the phone. Bad service all around
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2016-03-10,2,"I'm so done with this store, I'm completely over them!!! My venti toffee it latte was tossed in the garbage as I walked out again.  I don't understand why you take time to order your drink with specifications with the cashier and the barista ignore all that just makes what they want!!!!! Only reason they got 2 stars is because of Tamir, Debra and Sammy when they're working my drinks on point....."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2015-11-25,1,"My first Yelp review and I'm sorry to say it's bad.  

This Starbucks coffee shop has no sugar (neither in the raw or regular) on a Wednesday morning. Rude staff. They ignore polite customers. There are 2-3 cashiers and no help at the actual serving end. The man restocking looks you straight in the eye, listens to your request and then turns his back. Oh, they're also busy joking and laughing with each other while ignoring the customers. 

I will not come here again."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2015-10-12,1,"Never apologize for having high standards!

Wow...i asked for less ice...but my cup is still full of ice..why did they do that?!?

if you have to wait 1/2 hr in a line ( to order) -then let's face it....something is VERY wrong....I like Starbucks....but to wait long in a line like that is a little regardless...NO THANKS! even it was tasted good ( which it wasn't!!) because my drink was full of ice!!"
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2015-10-08,1,"Terrible. Incompetent servers. Always dread stepping inside. They always seem to get my order wrong, take 20 minutes for a coffee, and be generally rude."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2015-08-28,2,"Coffee shops are supposed to be relaxing and pleasant. This Starbucks plays the worst music I've ever heard, extremely loudly, causing me to feel nervous and aggravated every time I go in. 

The folks who work there seem pleasant enough but can't they please turn down the awful music?"
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2015-08-25,1,"Had one of THE worst experiences I've had at a Starbucks--at any coffee shop, really. I recently got a job on Madison Avenue and scouted out coffee shops nearby where I could study before work (I am a grad student writing my dissertation). There are not many coffee shops in the area, and I, of course, went to Starbucks, as its stable, consistent, and good quality. Yet today, not only was one of the baristas *incredibly* rude and unfriendly to me (the other, who made my drink, was very kind, and made an excellent drink, for what it is worth), but the environment in the shop was awful. The booth tables were incredibly wobbly and not conducive to seating, the store was blasting rap and hip hop music- the combo of the volume and style of music made it near impossible to study, the store was *especially* freezing (I study at starbucks regularly, I am used to freezing cold stores, but this was exceptionally bad), and the bathroom was broken- the light was out so it was closed and customers were not allowed to use it. Most of all, though, the inhospitality and rudeness of the one barista made it an awful and unproductive morning. I will NOT be visiting that starbucks again, which is incredibly unfortunate as it is the closest coffee shop to my work."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2015-08-09,1,"Is there a way to give less than 1 star? This place is the worst Starbucks I've ever been. The staff is beyond slow, even when it's not busy. On a Sunday morning they had a staff of 5 people, and it still took over 15 to get a drink. Whoever is the manager , or store manager should be fired , and clean up the store. Customer service is totally forgotten at this location."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2015-07-01,1,"This place is a zoo when it's not even that busy. Nothing gets communicated between register and barista; poor barista ends up asking customers to repeat orders and the service quality decreases.

So many Starbucks around; go to a different one."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2015-06-11,4,This location is convenient!!! The baristas and staff are friendly and quick. It is usually busy but the wait is not long. I have been coming to this location for years and it has been great. Just note there is usually a line so be prepared to wait at least 5mins.
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2015-04-24,4,"Pretty clean location, like the staff everyone cool ... A little wait for drinks but nothing unusual lol :)"
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2015-04-08,1,AVOID THIS STARBUCKS!  Long lines are least of problems. Staff is slow and most are incompetent and unfriendly. Decaf coffe is rarely ready.  Last time I waited 15 minutes at 3 pm only to be asked if I could wait 10 more minutes for my coffee!  I left in disgust & went next door for Tea - which I never drink [fast service with warm smiles].  I live a block away and will NEVER go back to this Starbucks. They should be ashamed.
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2014-11-18,1,"This place has got to be the WORST Starbucks in the city. Hands down. As many New Yorkers, I have visited countless outlets all over the place and this joint is CONSISTENTLY crowded, run down, poorly lit, dirty, dirty, dirty and WORST OF ALL has easily THE most DISINTERESTED, lazy, poorly mannered, poorly dressed, poorly presented, badly trained, untalented (i.e. can't make a plain latte - you know the drink essential to the mass success of this pedestrian leviathan), public school illiterate (""Nah. No mochas. Ain't got no chocolate, bro."" Verbatim from the little tattooed guy with the earrings and baseball cap who ignored me for the first 5 minutes of being the only person waiting for a coffee tonight at 623pm on November 17, 2014.

You know why I am ranting?

You nincompoops think you're jaded? Trying having to pay to get aggravated every time you walk into some crappy overpriced shop selling subpar products for the next 33 years in Manhattan and tell me how placid you still feel.

Either manage that dump the right way or sell it to someone who could thrive in that spot. And please hire new employees. Tonight was the last time I will EVER go here. And you may have already guessed that any opinion I may share with friends regarding this product will surely be as creatively worded as this review.

It's all good, though. I should have stopped drinking this sludge years ago! And tonight's been the perfect straw to break the proverbial camel's back. Ciao Starbucks!

I feel so much better already."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2014-11-14,4,"This place is always busy and bustling with students from Hunter College, business people, students from a nearby middle school, and the like. It's great to grab a quick coffee in between classes and the staff are usually friendly. One time a barista wrote a smiley face on my coffee cup and I'll never forget it."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2014-10-25,2,"Always has the longest lines I've EVER seen at a Starbucks. This one is near my job, so it's a convenient location, but it sucks that I can never go before work unless I leave myself at least 20 minutes. 

However, the thing that really prompted my review today was a very rude barista that was working this morning. A male barista (who seemed new) asked her a few simple questions and she just barked at him each time. Then, an older woman noticed an iPad that had been left at the counter, and asked the (rude) barista if she knew whose it was. It would have been so easy for her to be like ""I'm not sure! But let me take it behind the counter; I'm sure they'll come back for it."" Instead, she looked at the older woman who was just doing her civic duty and went ""how would I know whose iPad that is?"" .......I cringed.

I'm sure being a barista is a stressful job, but that one girl needs a 'tude check.

In my experience, the rest of the staff--albeit not the speediest bunch--have all been very friendly."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2014-10-07,1,"They closed this Starbucks down for renovation over the summer. When they reopened, I noticed they changed the line to go in the back instead of by the door. That's an improvement... but that's about it. I love paying $4.25 for a fancy drink made completely wrong.  I asked for an iced tea (no joke). They gave me a cold green drink that looked like Slimer from Ghostbuster's puke. It tasted like complete sh*t too. It took the barista 15 minutes to make because he was talking on his cell phone. 15 minutes of waiting for a near $5 dollar drink that wasn't even what I ordered. Also... one more thing... this place never has any coffee brewed and when they do... it's only pike. Have you ever tried that blend??? It tastes like manure. It looks like it too. They never have the blonde blend. It's pike or nothing. Now I walk to the Starbucks on Lex a few blocks away. They're nice and always have three or four blends brewed fresh."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2014-09-12,2,"It's hot, flat and crowded in here -- 25 minute wait for a drink -- but the hospitality is still up to Starbucks' high bar."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2014-08-30,1,"poor management, slow unfriendly service; they also close early when they feel like it. on a number of occasions they've forgotten my order and I had to wait again for them to make it. go elsewhere like SBUX on 3rd ave 60/61."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2014-07-21,5,"I went to SVF around the corner, and on my lunch period I would almost always hit this joint. The staff are amazingly nice, and really make an effort to get to know you. Great location, and store is nice and clean."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2014-07-07,1,"I live in the UES and this is a convenient Starbucks to go to on my way to the 63rd St Subway.  Being Dominican I'm embarrassed  to say that the female Dominican barista (working on 7/7/14) is rude to customers (including me), loud and spends her time talking trash in Spanish to the other Spanish speaking employees.
 Needless to say that today will be the last day I spend my money here."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2014-03-12,1,"Waited too long for my drinks here.  Like someone said below, the cashiers are generally fast, but the baristas are SO SLOW. The cashier said my name to the guy who was writing names down on the cups and he said  WHO???? LOL just give me my damn drink.....ugh remind me never to come here again."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2013-11-15,1,"This place is in a great location, but the staff is ghetto. I came here for a cup of coffee, and they were all cursing, and taking about drinking.. I would never bring my kids to this place, and hope the leadership team does some serious cleaning up."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2013-11-05,4,"Very long lines in the morning, rushed orders and small sitting space. I usually get my coffee and breakfast to go. My experiences here are pretty average. The staff however,  always seems to be running around frantic and some of them are rude. They appear disorganized and never really know what is going on. Thank goodness the coffee tastes just as it should."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2013-11-05,2,"This is my usual Starbucks on the UES. It's the closest one to my work so I find myself here sometimes. Unfortunately this place always has a long line and wait. I think all the students from nearby colleges go here. There's not a whole lot of space so you may find yourself shoulder-to-shoulder. The staff is very friendly here-- there's a lot of young workers, always helpful. Other than that, there's a bit of seating in the back as well as along the windows/walls. Overall, okay location."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2013-10-19,4,"Very good service here. I like the attention to detail everyone has here. They ask you just how much soy in your vanilla latte. 

Very large, however it's always packed. 

If your here for in and out service that will definitely be your best bet, if you want to sit and chat? Say a prayer you find a seat or two for that matter."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2013-09-06,2,"Not a bad Starbucks store...BUT (oh Jesus here he goes). I bought a tall Valencia Orange refresher & asked for a refill of bold coffee. But the Stupid BUTCH or Manly-looking White (I ALWAYS write down the race to be more real and to the point) barista gave me such a hard time and in the end, I DID NOT get what I wanted. To worsen the case, she looked like the shift manager there (she worked today and left around 4pm-ish) Our conversation went something like this:

Me: Hi, I would like a refill and would like a Tall Bold with no room please *hands the tall cup to barista*
Barista: *gives me a skeptical look* Did you stay in the store??
Me: Yes, I was just there (pointing at the window seat) and you were the one who took my order just about an hour ago, remember?
Barista: Hmm, so I see you got the Orange Valencia Refresher, you can ONLY get the refresher as a refill.
Me: Are you absolutely sure about that? Because I know you can't get refills on these nor any specialty drinks like lattes or espresso-basd drinks
Barista: Yes you can
Me: Oh? OK then, get me a refill of the tall Orange Valencia *takes out my Smartphone Starbucks app* for Refill
Barista: *Tries to ring me up for refill* Oh, you can't get refills for the refreshers
Me: That is what I said, that's why I asked for a Tall Bold instead *shakes my head*
Barista: Oh, it's ok, you can just have the refresher 
Me: ...

It was getting chilly inside the store and I wanted some hot coffee and being refused by a BUTCH-faced barista was a gross enough experience to never come back to this particular store. Starbucks,  please do yourself a favor, please hire some good looking people, we don't need fat, ugly and ignorant people working at your stores that have NO FUCKING clue how the refill policy works and stresses out customers. Hell, even I KNOW Starbucks refill policies MUCH better than this stupid self-important smart bitch

In the end I got another free refresher that costs much more than a Tall Bold, drank the entire drink in less than 5 minutes and left the store UNHAPPY. If YOU, yes YOU the butch-looking double-chinned girl (not the one with glasses) are reading this, I would like to thank you for being stupid and NOT acknowledging to customer requests.

TWO stars are for the other baristas that were friendly UNLIKE that shift manager lady that was frowning the entire time while she was working and looked like she was on PMS or something lol"
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2013-08-18,2,Overpriced acidic bitter coffee. Staff can't make a decent espresso even with those expensive machines from Italy .
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2013-07-17,3,"This is the best looking Starbuck's in the Upper East or Upper West Side I have visited And the baristas are very nice. And it's a block from the apartment. Very good. 

But there is NOWHERE to sit. Very bad. What's the point of building such a pretty Starbucks and spending money on the construction if there is nowhere to sit? 

By Bloomingdales, you have ""commuter"" Starbucks. You're not supposed to sit there. You walk in, get your whatever, and walk out. 

The communal table was a bad choice in a place with limited footage. I'm no decorator but smaller tables closer together would have been a better choice. Also, there are these super plush comfy window seats but only two (they fit two if you're cozy and happy to sit cross-legged). 

I was so excited when this opened as the 60th and 3rd location doesn't thrill me and the commuter ones not good to sit down. But now I finally have WiFi so I don't really care and I have an iPhone 5 with a hot spot so I can make a hot spot anywhere I like and don't need Starbucks for WiFi (and yes of course, I always buy something). 

My favorite Starbucks used to be 66th and 3rd. If you actually want to chat and interact, that's the best one in this part of the UES."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2013-06-10,2,"This Starbucks location is close to where I live, so it is unfortunately my go-to location.  I say unfortunately, and I give the 2-star rating, all the while keeping in mind what you should expect out of a Starbucks.  The one good thing I can say about this location is that the baristas are nicer/friendlier than what I have come to expect from baristas at most Starbucks locations (usually disgruntled employees who hate their job).  Beyond that, this location SUCKS.  There is never any available seating, the location is small and cramped, even for a Manhattan business.  The coffee (my order is an iced coffee black, unsweetened) is always burnt, and I would say my coffee comes out sweetened maybe 50% of the time here (I said the baristas were friendly, not that they were good baristas).  Again, it is the closest Starbucks to my apartment, so I come here often (probably 2-4 times a week), but I gotta say, I really hate being inside there, so I always get my coffee and get out as quickly as possible (which for me is a bummer, because back in college, my wife and I would go to the Starbucks on campus and sit there for hours sometimes, drinking coffee, doing homework, and talking, which is not a possibility here)."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2013-05-10,2,"This particular Starbucks is in the vicinity of my office so I tend to go at least 3 times out the week but I don't know why I torture myself by going.  Maybe it's just me or the time I get there which is usually around 6:30am give or take but at times they seem short as if they don't want to be bothered.  Also, they tend to try to take on 4 to 5 different orders instead of 1 or no more than 3 and you wait at least 10 minutes for your beverage.  Furthermore there espresso machine tends to break down at times so that means I can't order my favorite caramel machiato, bummer! Today they were so out of touch with the customers that the employee gave my artisan ham, egg and cheese away to another customer.  Now I am waiting 15 minutes for coffee & sandwich.  I guess it is what it is because it's Starbucks but I rather find somewhere else in the neighborhood to get my morning Joe or just buy the pack of coffee and make it at home."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2012-12-02,2,"Do all white people look the same? Two women, one orders a coffee and I pay for it... she slides down to get the coffee.. another one orders a coffee and I pay for it (that's two if you're keeping count) and SHE then slides down to get it. I oder a coffee and I too slide down... and voila, ""I already got you (the second woman) your coffee"".. Ummm NO you didn't and while they might be friends there is lil resemblance except they were white. 

Staff in this location in which I have been to several times is getting worse and ought to recognize people by their face and not their skin color or coffee. 

Take your pot shots at me now but I purposefully skip this location to go somewhere better."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2012-11-16,4,Okay place. Line is alway BONKERS long! Baristas are sometimes uptight. Music is not too loud. All in all they get the job done.
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2012-08-23,3,"First time I was ever at this Starbucks in my neighborhood. I guess the main thing that stands out to me is that it is a fairly large location with plenty of seating in the back, and counter seating alongside the windows in both the front and rear. The setup is long and very open. Clean overall. Still, almost every seat this morning was taken up by wifi hogs, and many which I observed not even drinking or eating anything. WTF? Go to the library instead of taking up a spot I might want to actually sit at and enjoy my iced coffee!

I have also noticed that the staff is more concerned about their own personal conversations than helping customers similar to what others have mentioned in previous reviews. Uh hello? I'm standing right here. Can you take my order?

As far as a Stabucks this one is pretty much ok, and is par for the course."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2012-01-09,4,"Always a long line, but what do you expect? Nice baristas, clean store, easy location."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2011-12-07,5,"This Starbucks - the entire thing, the store itself - is good people.

I went this one time with my mom (and this woman can't have caffeine or her heart will go crazy - imagine that) and we got the same drink (a latte), though neither one of us remembered to specify decaf for hers.

So she takes a sip and suddenly realizes there's caffeine (she's got caffeine radar in her brain, I swear) and I take it up, already feeling bad that it's our fault, but knowing full well that another drink will certainly be made. And not only did this particular barista let me keep the caffeinated one for myself, but she made a nice new one for my mom without even angrily, secretly spitting into it. Like I would have. (It gets busy at this Starbucks.)

All that being said, I love you guys.

And yeah, the seating sucks. But whatever. If you can find a seat, sit in it. Otherwise, just go home. If you're at this Starbucks, you probably don't live too far away anyway. And yes, that's a gross generalization (it's also true)."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2011-03-10,2,"Bad Sbux. Bad layout (long and narrow, you're always bumping into people). Loud music. Lacking the vibe. Meh"
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2010-11-29,2,I have frequented this starbucks  for the past few months and everything was normal until today. I got a grande caramel brulee latte and rushed off to school. The cup feels light in my hand but i shook the feeling off.when I took a sip 2 blocks later I realized it was taking curiously long for the coffee to reach my lips...so I took off the lid...and it was half full! I am so angry and the taste was different from how the caramel brulee latte at other starbucks taste. Burnt bad tasting. Grr
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2010-03-24,4,"This is a Starbuckst to go to when I come by Park Amory and Right now there's AIPAD going on. That means lots of people, especially long line for bathroom(I'd hate it when 4 gal friends come altogether and stand in a line..come on, some kind of  bladder friends!) 

Yet I like this place; ample sun's in and Amory brings in the art feel too and disguise the air, so i'd feel somehow appreciative."
154,starbucks-new-york-352,2006-01-30,4,"I am going to have to agree with the person above, It really is an over priced but fine establishment."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2020-03-22,3,"I love the layout of the store since it is spacious and clean.  They have a bunch of these shops around nyc so looks like they market well. The problem is the product is lackluster. My coworker said I had to try the cannelle which is a unique pastry. It definitely has an interesting taste but it tasted a day old. I tried the chocolate chip cookie and it was hard.  Actually, everything tasted a day old. They have to sort that out. 

I think people come here because its convenient and available. The product quality was low and hopefully it was just an off day.  They need to keep the standards higher if they want to be known as more than an average bakery chain."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2020-02-14,5,My fiance and I didn't plan on stopping here but we were sure glad we did. The pastries were delicious and the to go breakfast was great. Also some the of best coffee I had in the area. The croissants were so good we got a variety of them to take back to Texas.
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2020-01-29,3,"I'm a morning person so while the rest of my group was still asleep (or at least enjoying coffee in bed), I was out checking out the local area and getting a pre-breakfast snack. Even though it was the weekend, the bakery was already filled with tourists and locals alike. The shelves were piled with baguettes, epis, and boules and the cases were filled with breakfast pastries and yummy desserts. For breakfast, guests can choose from financiers, croissants, and brioches. There were also stacks of cookies (chocolate, macadamia, and pistachio) and packages of colorful macarons. I wanted to try everything but knew that we would be headed out to brunch soon.

After some consideration, I picked out an almond croissant for my sister and a pain aux raisins for myself. The bun itself was okay, a bit denser than I would have liked. I did appreciate the lovely raisins layered between the tender dough. 

I do plan to return for the apple tart with the shingled apple slices and shiny glaze. The éclairs looked fantastic, as did the chocolate tart. I also would like a taste of the plié au chocolat - just the name alone was interesting and uncommon.

Service was okay. The counterperson got both items wrong but luckily I caught the errors before I left with the goods."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2020-01-23,1,"What a nightmare! The restaurant is expanding and undergoing major construction. You would think they would close it, or move the drilling and hammering until after hours. They have not. They have simply put up a plastic sheet around the affected area. The noise is deafening and there is dust in the air. Maybe you can drop in after this is over, but don't make a plan to meet someone there, as they are completely unapologetic and it could happen again any time."

155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-12-08,4,This place exudes the smell of fresh baked goods miles away. I'm so surprised I haven't been here earlier as NYC has many Maison Kayser locations. You can take away baked items and coffee or choose to get a table to sit down. I originally thought this was a serve yourself if you choose a table but there's actually table service. I got a vanilla latte and really enjoyed how fresh the coffee was and that it wasn't overly sweet. Would recommend for your next meet up with friends!
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-12-06,1,"It is  9:34pm on Friday night right now 
The women behind the cashier is extremely rude and condescending. Upon we entered the store we could sense the frustration in her tone of voice to other customers. And when we were browsing the pastry at the counter, she kept telling us to form a line , "" form a line ! I'm only one person "" she said 

We are not children 

The store manager should really train the staff for proper greeting and hospitality. 

Will not return again"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-12-03,5,"Delicious!  I went with my mom and we had a lovely brunch.  You can sit in the cafe or order to go from the bakery shop, it's always a great experience!
Kaneez"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-11-24,4,Maison Kayser is my favorite spot for breakfast when I visit NY. I love their croissants and coffee. Super simple and really reminds me of France. ENJOY!
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-11-16,3,Unfortunately the coffee was not as good as I thought as French bakery. Had brunch this time and didn't try pasty this time. Only thing impress me was French onion soup.
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-10-26,5,"I came in for Brunch earlier and was a bit concerned when I saw how busy it was ,we were fortunate enough to be seated by our server (Fatna).she was very energetic,attentive and a wonderful person. We were very impressed with how smoothly things ran considering most of the dining area was seated,Additionally coffee was great,fresh creative healthy food,best breads in town. 
We'll come back for sure"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-10-18,5,"I stopped by this adorable bakery on my way to work, hoping to pick up a cake for my boss' birthday. Their selection was very elegant and I chose a chocolate mouse cake covered with little macarons. It had a fruit (maybe passion fruit) curd filling which was light and the perfect tangy balance to the creamy chocolate. It was one of the most exquisite desserts I have ever tried!"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-10-04,3,Sandwich was good. But asked for ham and didn't get it. Brioche was very soft and fresh though. Will try again next time I'm in NYC.
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-10-04,5,"Such a cute place to pick up a pastry or have a quick bite to eat. They have several locations all over NY, but we stopped in the Lexington one since it was near our hotel. I had a croissant and one of their fresh juices: pineapple mint. So delicious! They have a full sit down area too, but we just snagged a little two-top to eat our pastries. Staff was very friendly and the place was nice and clean. Definitely will be back!"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-09-16,5,My favorite bread in nyc. I particularly love the staff at this location - they always put me in a better mood

155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-08-23,5,I stumbled here before meeting a friend. I ordered hot chocolate and decided to treat myself. And I discovered the best almond croissant ever!
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-08-11,5,"We loved our breakfast here (we sat down actually at the little restaurant area they have). Service was great, pastries all fresh and I was able to enjoy one of my France favorites: baguette with butter and jelly. Coffee was very good as well. Truly a little taste os France!"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-07-24,4,"I was just passing by and this delicious pastry caught my eye. It is the first time I visit this chain, they are not very cheap but want to believe it really worth it. The choice is not that big and I took a croissant with almond which it was quite good."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-06-30,4,"The pastries look better then what they taste like in my opinion. In no way it's awful but there's better. Also, the average price for the was $7-$8 for a tart or cake which is a good price. I'd give it another shot."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-06-24,3,"Contrary to the reviews, I felt the service was friendly and fast (I opted to dine in). However the food was sub-par, especially for the price. While I came here for the coquettes, I was disappointed to hear that the company only offers an option with Ham, and has removed the salmon and vegetarian options from the menu (which were one of my favorite items at the original Maison Kayser). I thus instead opted for the avocado toast. I received two pieces of cold, chewy bread (tasted refrigerated and not fresh despite my dining here at 8am). I believe the kitchen neglected to toast or heat the bread and thus I had avocado on cold chewy bread vs. avocado toast. Eggs were okay (didn't seem super high quality or tasty), and strangely there was not an option for poached eggs (only scrambled or sunny side up which do not go well with avocado toast). Hot chocolate was good. Overall I believe this restaurant has lost a lot of its original charm when becoming a widespread chain. It's unfortunate as it used to be one of my favorites. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-06-21,2,"We were visiting NYC and dropped by this branch of Maison Kayser to give their croissant and almond croissant a try. We want to compare it to what we had in Paris at a Maison Kayser there, as well as some of the top-rated boulangeries in Paris, such as 134 RdT, Le Grenier a Pain, Gontran Cherrier, Ble Sucre, etc. To say the least, we were terribly disappointed in the NYC version. The croissant was spongy, no crispness, no flakiness, and tasted like slightly sweet dough. There was none of the subtle rich buttery taste and mild sweetness, and incredible flakiness and crispness that one would get from a croissant at Le Grenier a Pain or 134 RdT. The almond croissant was even worse, It was just a soggy mass of almond paste, no texture, and nothing to suggest that it was even a croissant. It appeared as if they had been baked in some industrial plant off site and trucked en mass to the ""boulangerie"". In Paris,  Eric Kayser would not dare have his name associated with this quality of baked goods. In Paris, Eric Kayer's boulangeries are actually fairly decent.  The only saving grace is that the walnut raisin bread was decent. I'm being generous giving them 2 stars, because of the decent bread we bought. 
If you have never had a real croissant from a top-rate boulangerie in Paris, you may not know the difference. However, if you have, this version is not worth wasting the calories."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-06-16,4,"Fast Service and great food, croissants are quite big! Tables are a bit tight, but would definitely come back while I'm in NYC"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-06-13,4,"One of my favorite coffee & pastry chains! 

Food: Ordered a hot chocolate and a raspberry financier on a terribly rainy day. Hot chocolate could've been warmer on a day like this, but the raspberry financier was delightful.

Atmosphere: I went at 9 am and stayed for 50 minutes. It was a bit crowded, but what you would expect from a weekday morning in the city. Came back again at 11 and stayed for an hour, much more crowded this time. Still, it is a nice place to sit and read (like I did). Staff was very friendly and cheerful. Aesthetically pleasing shop as well. 

Price: A little pricey for sweets and drinks. Wouldn't go here on the regular, but always a nice treat to stop in."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-05-30,1,"Hello Disorder! I tried twice to come here and sit for breakfast. Once the server just never walked over so I left than I couldn't find a decent place to eat, came back to sit at the counter. 

I waited in a chaotic line where it looked like I could order breakfast only to be told by the Asian kid, I needed to sit down to order and he literally was standing counting pennies. Is this a place to eat or what??

I go back to the sitting area.... I waited again now being late for work and asked the server if she was coming over? She barely turned around and replied ""in a minute"" as rude and abrupt as she could...I'm the wrong chick at this point. I gave her the NY death stare so I wouldn't get a war of words I went back to the front and told them they needed to get their service in order, plenty were standing around doing nothing. What a mess.

The server at this moment comes back and starts yelling at her colleagues, than looks at me and says I'm ready for you...you kidding I'm not sitting down with you when you are ready lmao. I told her she needs to learn how to work in the restaurant business since she couldn't handle coffee and an egg sandwich. She had 3 tables yelp, three. 

Adios to my business Maison."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-05-27,5,"When I book a hotel, I always look for a Maison Kayser nearby so I can spend a quiet morning with a cup of good coffee, flavorful breakfast and a soft-fluffy Viennoise. I always bring half-dozen small white chocolate viennoise or white chocolate w/ pecan viennoise back home so I can still enjoy this sweet-soft bread. 
I tired many items on their menu from breakfast, lunch, brunch to their pastries and all of them are flavorful with peak-season ingredients.
Unlike other chain restaurant, Maison kayser does a very good QC job. No matter which location you visit, you can always count on high-quality fresh ingredient, tasty food, delicious pastries, and staffs are very attentive and gracious."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-05-09,2,"Terrible service.  I've found this to be especially true in the mornings.  The people who work there don't seem to have any idea how to treat a customer.  The level of indifference one feels is crazy.  Not sure what they think their role is when a customer comes in to buy something.  Some of the food is good, and some is just okay...but it's this part with the staff that makes me kick myself for going back.  I see several other reviews on this topic, so I don't think it's a mystery that this needs to be better."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-05-06,2,"The only part of the oatmeal dish that gave it any amount of flavor was the banana and brown sugar that was served with it, pretty disappointing for a $12 item
The service was fairly quick, but it also felt that we were being pushed out at times which was strange given the number of open tables. 
In addition being placed at a table cramped into a small corner when there were many open tables with more space was a little strange. 
Coffee tasted great and their selection of desserts and drinks were the only saving grace of the meal"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-05-06,2,"This is the only location I've been to where the service is so poor. The attitude coming off of the three similar-looking women behind the counter, all standing at the empty registers, no one even making eye contact, it's just complete and utter BS. Maybe all of them are having a simultaneous bad day. Maybe their cycles are synced. Who knows? But gtfo of the service industry. 

Update: customer service got back to me on this. Thank you, much appreciated. As for the offer to speak to someone about it, I'll pass. What I would appreciate is if you would talk to the daytime shift gals and tell them to actually GREET PAYING CUSTOMERS. Even smile, if it isn't too tiring."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-05-04,4,"in the last few years maison kayser has popped up all over nyc and thats a good thing. the sweets are my favorite with the lemon tarts and eclairs out of this world yummy . the fresh breads , soups, sandwiches , salads, coffees, , etc are winners as well . i stopped by the mk location on lexington ave and grabbed a full size lemon tart and 4 coffee eclairs which cost me about 57 bucks and thats ok cause quality cost a bit more but well worth it . the workers are always friendly and nice while keeping the place clean and well stocked with the good stuff right in the front glass display for easy viewing . i also like the olive loaf which sells out fast and if i forget to pick up a few almond crossiants for my sister i am in big trouble.  i wrote this review while enjoying my lemon tart and orange juice on a friday morning , now thats a good way to start my day."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-05-01,5,Great sandwiches and great pastry's. Everything is very well organized and the taste is amazing. A croque Mousiier and a lemon tart were to die for
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-05-01,2,"Looks and smells better than it tastes. I work around the area and can always smell butter when I walk by. 

I finally decided to try some of the items. I bought a lemon tart and mini madeleines. The lemon tart was average, nothing outstanding. However, the madeleines were disgusting. Based on the package, they were baked or packed the day of, but it was incredibly dry and crumbly."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-04-26,4,"I only had a tea here and was waiting around while my honey was having a business meeting but it's definitely a nice place to hang out.  I told him ahead of time about how good the food is but I don't think he had any.  I was relieved nobody hassled me as I was waiting and I saw others sitting nearby on their electronic devices not being harassed so that was a relief.  The tea was really good and a proper size for me.  If I were in the area, this seems like a spot you can go on Sunday afternoon without having to deal with crazy crowds or tons of noise."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-04-14,2,"Beautiful restaurant but don't let it fool you. Keep walking. I wanted to order one of the sandwiches on the menu and I asked for a different type of bread. Not possible. Whoever heard of a restaurant that won't substitute one equal type item for another. In this day and age restaurants are expected to be flexible within reason. Ok. So I order eggs with Gruyere cheese. The eggs were served cold so the cheese never got to melt. All this for $15 for a small cold egg sandwich. My companion's toast was cold and hard. Restaurant was not crowded since we were there early on a Sunday morning. They dropped the ball on this one.

Update:  server said its policy to not allow changes. Ridiculous. She did give us a free croissant to make up for our lackluster meal. Very nice gesture. Management needs to rethink a few things."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-03-25,5,The service here was amazing. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I came here with my daughter and both of us loved the food and were raving about it the whole day. Highly recommend the Croque Madame and the French toast.
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-03-22,4,"The dessert looks very beautiful but tasted average. The service was kind and friendly. However, they service everything in to go containers even if you want to dine in. Not very environmental friendly in that aspect. No WiFi service here"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-03-21,1,"Terrible table service! We were staying at a nearby hotel and my mom swore that we had to come here for breakfast because they have the best almond croissants (she says better then Paris), so we popped in and saw that we could sit down for table service and decided to give it a try. 

My mom ordered the croque madame, my dad ordered a mushroom dish and I ordered croissant sandwich with ham, and we asked to all split a almond croissant. 

The first red flag came when the waiter walked away and came back a minute later to confirm my moms order again (he didn't write it down). They then brought out tea and my mom and I both ordered English breakfast, but she got an earl grey - easy fix because it's a tea bag. 

They then bring us our food and place avocado toast in front of my dad... not what he ordered AT ALL! they took it away to replace with his mushroom dish. My croissant sandwich was just ok - the eggs were cold (maybe premade?), and overall not very flavorful. They finally come with my dad's dish, he accepts it and they walk away. He then informs us that this is still NOT what he ordered - they have two mushroom dishes and gave him the porridge style one.... he ate it and said it was good, but I know that he was just trying to please my mom. 

They took our plates and then we sat there for about 10 more minutes before I asked where our almond croissant was - they didn't know we ordered one... finally it comes and I will admit it was pretty good, but the overall experience was so terrible I just wanted to leave. 

We again waited a while after finishing the croissant and had to wave over the server again for our bill. I don't know if the staff was brand new or what, but this was the worst service that I have ever experienced! The restaurant wasn't busy - only 3 other occupied tables and 2 servers working. 

I hope they can get their act together because the space is beautiful and could be a great success. The pastries in the bakery area are beautiful and I wish that we had just grabbed a bunch and left rather then sat down."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-01-28,4,"My husband and I came here on a Monday @ 10Aish and didn't have a problem finding a table and was seated promptly. Ordered the french toast and it was the best french toast ever. Husband is a regular here and he enjoyed the eggs, avocado and toast! Coffee was good and server came by frequently to refill our cups. Service was attentive and atmosphere quaint. $45 later and still would return although pricey as stated on other TA posts."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-01-27,1,"A super rude cashier customer service. We ordered pastries and she misunderstood what we ordered. I asked her to change what she picked it up. During paying in front of the cashier, she sighed and showed some attitude. Was i wrong? Did i do something bad for her? Nobody forces you to work there... if you don't like working, you should quit working. i will never go back to Maison Kayser at 51st location."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-01-25,5,"I do not understand how this place doesn't have a 5 star review. For about $5 I got a strong coffee with a shot of espresso. Mind you I had this after a red eye flight where I got two hours if sleep and didn't sleep that night until 6am!!! 

This friggin coffee energized me all night. My friends got a breakfast sandwich that the guy recommended adding ham to it for free and a pastry which they both liked. They do the European style of scrambled egg where it's still a bit soft and runny. 

It was so good that I went back two more times during my trip only hitting Starbucks once since I knew this coffee spot would keep me energized. It was conveniently located in the metropolitan area of NYC and the service was excellent every time. I have no complaints at all about this place."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-01-25,3,"Nice and friendly staff , but no great quality dessert. I bought an apple tart for a party and it was frozen and tasteless."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-01-15,5,conveniently located  in Midtown Manhattan.  Cute place that has so many  options for French  pasties lunch and breakfast.  today i had the French toast  with berries.  It was made with brioche.  I loved it so much  that  now this  is  my favorite  place  in the area.  i had table service  and my waiter was excellent! this is a happy  experience  for sure!
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-01-08,1,"I came here and got a coffee a few months ago and enjoyed it. But yesterday I had a very worrisome experience here. I have a tree nut allergy and asked the girl working what was in the double chocolate cookie. She said ""chocolate."" I pressed, asking if there were nuts in the double chocolate cookie. She looked confused and said she didn't think so and seemed annoyed when I said that wasn't enough info. Now you'd think when working in a bakery they'd teach the employees they need to know what is in the products because of allergies. I literally had to spell it out to her and said I cannot eat tree nuts and finally she pried the tag out of the case to read it. Which she couldn't figure it out so she had to ask someone else. Fortunately, I don't have the most severe allergy so this cookie wouldn't have been life or death for me, but for some people it could be and I would urge the managers here to better teach their employees. 

And I did get the cookie once they figured out what was in it. It was hard as a rock."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-01-03,3,"Stopped in on a Friday afternoon to pick up some pastries for the weekend. When I approached the counter I told the gentleman I would like to spend about $35 on pastries and I asked if he could help me choose some. He looked at me with a blank stare and offered absolutely no help. Great! So instead I pointed to a few pastries that I thought looked good such as the berry tart, the berry buche, and the berry buche. I asked him if I could close to $35 and he said ""I don't know"". Amazing! So i added it up in my head and added a chocolate tart. Then before I could even do the math he started boxing up the desserts. This took about 5 minutes and was painful to watch. When he rang me up, the total came to under $30 which was annoying because I could have added another item. I paid and after paying he let me know that he damaged the chocolate buche when he was putting it in the box. I was very upset about this because I was bring these desserts to a friends house that night so I asked if it was noticeable damage, he replied ""no you can't see it"". 
Well when I opened the box at my friends house to present the dessert what do you know the whole corner was missing from my chocolate buche. What a jerk!!!

It is a shame because the desserts are so pretty and taste delicious but the staff is seriously incompetent. 

My favorites: The berry buche and the Kayser (chocolate) buche."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2019-01-02,2,Mushroom soup on 1/2 was insanely salty. Good pastries though. Wouldn't recommend their soups or food considering sodium levels.
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-12-24,5,"Great breakfast, service at a reasonable price for this area.  My wife and 12 and 8 y.o. Sat down and had great tasting/ quality ingredient food.  Coffee is excellent (I am a starbucks drinker and it was on par with that)."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-12-23,2,"Superb croissants, great breads, which would normally warrant 4 stars, but the buck stops there.  The brunch is overpriced for what you get and it wasn't even that great.  If you cannot get an Eggs Benedict right, you cannot charge me that much for 2 eggs and what tasted like 1 thinly sliced of piece of deli ham.  If you cannot poach an egg right, then 2 stars it is.  Finally we had to juggle our food almost in our laps because they would give us 2 small tables instead of having us (2 adults + a toddler) sit at a 2 person table.  Their excuse was that place was gonna get busy and they may need the table.  Behold, 2 entrees, 2 sides, and 2 pastries later...the table next to us remained empty for the entirety of our stay.  Thanks a lot."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-12-21,4,"Pastries are good, but the coffee is a bit subpar. I might be biased because of do many coffee choices in this immediate area."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-12-06,3,"Always like this place. I did forget that it was no cash (this is the one time, I reached for cash to pay). I ordered a coffee and a salad and my daughter had a cold drink. I always like the atmosphere here. Relaxing and casual. You could do work. You could chat with your friends. They have a lovely selection of pastries and chocolates too! I love that they're all over the city so I can find one in whatever neighborhood I need to. It doesn't matter your age - everyone is welcome!"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-12-01,5,Deelish! Every time I go I have something delicious ! I've gotten my family hooked on the pastries like the almond  chocolate croissant and the adagio and the sandwiches are great too!
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-11-15,2,"Today, before the snow storm began, I was on an unintentional quest for a good chocolate croissant. I went to Financier, Urban Space, Gregory's Coffee, and finally settled on Maison Kayser. I was surprised by how bad this croissant was because usually Maison Kayser's goods are so delicious. Their madelines are to die for! The croissant was so flakey that it started to fall apart and was such a mess. Sort of resembled cockroach skin.. in the most nondisgusting way. The worst part was how much chocolate was in the actual croissant. The croissant was big as my hand and only had a quarter size amount of chocolate inside. I am so upset... 

Any suggestions for a good chocolate croissant around midtown east?"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-10-28,1,The food is good but don't plan on eating there after 4 they only have excuses!!! Just get to go then you don't have to deal with the rude staff!!!
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-09-25,5,"Great sandwiches and pastries..coffee and cold brew is good!
Probably the most high end cafes in NYC"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-09-20,1,"I gave two just for the quality of croissant and coffee. Overall the food is fresh and good. I always go to the one close by 34st herald square as it is close to my friend's salon. Now this one is close to my work I never had bad experience at 34 street so I tried this one on my way to work. This one is on Lexington Avenue just between my home and work. Now this is another Pret A Manger for me because customer service is Is pathetic. Honestly a street cart guy can give better customer service than these people. 
So I asked for coffee and a croissant sandwich which came with avocado,bacon, turkey and lettuce. The cashier didn't have any idea of what I was asking for and there was another girl behind her who gave me a weird look and both of them said no we don't have such thing. So I went back to check and make sure and I came back and told her it says it has bacon+avocado+turkey and lettuce and than she went and got it. No thank you, no sorry nothing!! Instead I was saying thank you and no empathy at all.
I gave 2 stars like I said just for the quality of food. But I'm never going there again"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-09-12,1,"I came for salad lunch each day as the salad was fresh although pricy.  I noticed however the salad dressing in the small containers had been getting less and less. Today when I stopped by for salad,  I took two small salad dressing containers as they were just half full in each container.  The cashier lady charged me extra for the meager dressing. When I told her the dressing was not enough,  she was very rude and said she knew that.  Unacceptable attitude.  Too bad a place like Eric Kayser is cutting corners using this gimmick.  Not coming back."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-08-31,5,First time I had good coffee in US. We liked cappuccino and chocolate eclair! Place itself is nice!
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-08-26,4,This is a small place clean and bright.  The staff were polite and friendly.   Coffee was perfect .  The wife had a croissant whether it's the best in NYC it is the best we have had since Paris. Soft buttery layered pastry in side with and nicely browned exterior.  I had the little summer vegetable quicke. It was small but satisfying .   Neither of us like large breakfasts so in NYC we got a super little breakfast for 16.00 total an accomplishment in NYC
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-08-08,5,"As an intern who had to come here to make multiple coffee/food runs for my co-workers, this place is the best! Every single staff member that I have interacted with here has been nothing but helpful and pleasant.

What prompted me to write this review is that just recently I came here with a large food and drink order and was very nervous about making sure that I got everything on my order list right. Christy and Mike were extremely helpful. Christy is so attentive and on point. She never gets my order wrong and is never frustrated when I ask questions about my orders. Mike, the manager, is also very hands on and is helpful to both employees and customers. He helped me gather my order together and even walked me to the door to make sure I didn't spill anything on the way. The young man who makes the drinks is also very nice and respectful of any special requests. 

The employees here really are what makes this location so special and the main reason why I keep coming back."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-08-06,1,"B A D service.
I was looking for some decent coffee and this place looked fine ,every near starbucks was already closed 'cause it was about 9:02 PM so I was happy that I found a place to get coffee.
When I got in they all looked at me like ""go away we don't want to do our job"" I asked for a cappuccino and guess what ,they already cleaned and turned off the coffee machine at 9:02 PM ,they're closing at 10 PM and the coffee machine is already off at 9:02 PM . 
Wouldn't recommend to anyone."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-07-21,4,"If your in Midtown East, and need a dessert that isn't going to cost an arm and a leg - go and enjoy the wonderful French pastries that are at Maison Kayser!  My sister and I wanted a little something befo.re we finished our night out and instead of some sweet drink, we went and shared three amazing treats:  a chocolate hazelnut torte, a peach and pistachio tart, and a raspberry cream cake.  Yum!  THEN we went back the next day and picked up wonderful lunch items for our Central Park bike ride:  crusty bread with a grilled chicken, herb spread, with arugula, tomatoes, and onions, plus a side of pesto penne with olives, tomatoes, and mozzarella.  The service was a bit spotty in the evening (yes, it was late), but the day service was wonderful.  I liked that this felt like a bit of Paris but with the gritty spunk of New York!"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-07-20,1,"Unfortunately, I agree with the other reviews that this particular location is poorly staffed and badly managed.  I've been a loyal customer of MK's Upper East Side locations for years.  The pastries and breads are great!

There always seems to be confusion about lines (where do they start, are there 1 or 3 separate lines?) and the cashiers are unfamiliar with the store polices.  I always see new faces.  Lots of employee turnover?

Wish I could go back to this location but it's not worth the hassle or inconsistent service and food."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-07-09,4,"I normally judge a bakery by its croissant. It was buttery, flakey and just divine. Of course expect to pay premium as well."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-07-02,4,Yummm almond crossaint!! Delicious and great almond flavor. Staff are super friendly!
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-04-20,4,It was a nice location for me. I went around 4pm and it wasn't too busy. The service was great. I ordered a hot chocolate and oatmeal cookie. The cookie was great but lots of raisins than expected. The hot chocolate was prob one of the not best I ever tasted. I have had better. Overall would come back one more time to try the chocolate almond croissant
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-04-07,4,"Three stars? No way.

These spots are found all over the city, and very much remind me of Paul in Paris. Good bread, stellar coffee, for a price. You pay more here than you might at other spots for a coffee but you'll be rewarded with quality. Every roll and baguette I've had here has been of better quality than normally found in the states, and the quiches are pretty great (Paris good? No, but not bad at all). The staff is a bit gruff, but this is tourist hell after all, I can't really blame them for being short.

Bring a baguette to any friends wine and cheese night, and you'll be a star, promise"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-04-03,5,Stopped by to find a pastry since I was craving sweets and picked up the almond and chocolate croissant. Absolutely delicious and would recommend that!
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-04-02,1,"I am never a big fan. I only go there because I need to buy for my significant other and it is literally right outside my office.

I was charged 5 pieces when I only asked for 4. I wouldn't have paid attention had I not have a fixed budget for my purchase. They did fix when I complained. It is unprofessional I felt like I was cheated.

I wish there is a different shop in that location so I don't need to watch them while they ring me up."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-03-27,4,"I love stopping here on my way to the office. Amazing options, croissants are to die for and fresh, and they're not as busy as some of the options close by. 

Chocolate Almond croissant is amazing."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-03-24,5,"I love love love this place.  it's like being in Paris.  just had a wonderful Serrano ham sandwich with figs and manchego cheese.  just what the doctor ordered.  I need to go back to Paris, miss it so much."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-02-25,1,"We sat in the back with waiter service, and the service was very poor. It's unfortunate because the food was good and bread was delicious but waiting 30 minutes for coffee really didn't help the experience. I thought they maybe need to adjust staffing levels because the one waiter had too much to do. The pastries and bread look beautiful as well. I would probably come back for takeout only."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-02-19,3,"This is the only Maison Kayser I have ever visited and that's because it's close to my office. 

This location is pretty large with plenty of seating. The pre-made sandwiches and salads are a hit or miss. Sometimes they have a little bit of everything, other times they barely have anything. Prices are what you'd expect for the city. The staff is always pleasant but they never have more than one register open. Also the lines can become confusing since one is for coffee, once is to buy pre-made stuff, etc. There's very little signage when it comes to this.

My main issue is the door. It pushes out to the street, with a little area they have setup for the cold winter months. Both doors wind up creating very little space to get through with the way they're setup. Also the seasonal setup only has one door therefore people are going in and out the same way non-stop. I'm trying not to go here until the spring, when they take this silly thing down. Makes no sense."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-02-11,1,"The worst service I've had for brunch ever! Ive been to several other locations but this one is by far the worst. We sat down 8 people and it took about 25 minutes till we got water. I asked for bread which they brought fairly quickly to hold over the kids. After we all placed our orders it took 38 minutes till we got our food. Our waiter was nowhere to be found for several minutes. Took about 20 minutes to get coffee, and then another 10 to get milk! They have major work to do if they want to stay open. Two of our orders were messed up. Overall terrible brunch experience took over 2 hrs! Avoid this location"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-02-03,2,I heard of Maison Kayser for years so I finally decided to try it. My sandwich lacked a lot of flavor. There wasn't a cashier around and the people behind me claimed their food was forgotten. They do have a nice seating area.
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-01-29,5,"Like being in Paris while in NY!!
Best pastries and breads!! Fresh croissants and pain du chocolate!!"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-01-22,4,"Located adjacent to our Doubletree hotel. Fresh French pastries, cakes, cookies, sandwiches and bread.  You can see the artisan craft in their bakery cases. Croissants are light, airy and crispy buttery through and through - so delish, the chocolate croissant is crispy buttery and a center of dark chocolatey goodness. Madeline's are puffy high and buttery, they have a huge grab and go refrigerated section for commuters, workers and travelers - salads, sandwiches, yogurt parfaits and more. Got the ham and gruyere     
on croissant for hubby's trip home.  Everything is fresh and delish, friendly counter service, menu of teas and coffee, cappuccino and full espresso bar."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-01-12,5,I stopped in here for an iced cappuccino with a colleague and they let us sit in table service which was really nice (since we were only getting coffee). The iced cappuccino was amazing and had to order a second one! I took the white chocolate bread home (which is a must) and a white bread. Everything smells and looks so perfect in there I want to try it all!
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-01-06,1,"New store in the area,bad service and very expensive,we had a soup without a piece of bread and a sirloin sandwich with a small piece of meat."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2018-01-04,4,"My review is for the bakery part (grab-and-go), not the back part where you can sit down for meals. I really like Maison Kayser's regular and almond croissants. Yes, it is a bit overpriced especially with a few more bakeries within a block vicinity, but I like to think of it as adding some Parisian flair to my mornings. I've been coming at least twice a week every day since this location opened up and have always been met with great service.

I do think there is room for improvement though. This location is pretty new, and I think they're still working out some kinks. For example, I've ordered cafe mocha a couple of times and it's been cold instead of hot. Overall, I'll keep coming back and throw my new year's diet resolution down the drain."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-12-29,1,Food is great. Service is absolutely terrible. Came here twice. Both times the service was horrible. I shouldn't have to ask for bread to go along with my soup.
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-12-18,1,"Tried a location by Brayton Park and it was good. The one on Lexington near 51st was a disastrous.  Waited for a server for 20 min, had to get attention of the manager name John. He put the order in wrong and they served somebody else is dish to our table on top of that. Served my dish took away the wrong dish bring the right for after additional 20 min. Bad management and service ruined the experience. They should hire managers like this.This place is in a stupid chaos."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-12-09,4,"Was very excited to see this cafe open up next to my work. Their basic bread is extremely moist and delicious, and I don't even like bread too much. 

Of course the new place looked clean and beautiful with a lot of space with a tall ceiling. I was impressed with their wide selection of salads, sandwiches, breads pastries, cafe drinks, and staff -- not to mention a large seated area.

The one downfall to this place is it's price. The salads and sandwiches are very expensive, so definitely not a place to grab a quick meal everyday. But more of a place you for a treat once in awhile or for a date or meeting. Paying for the ambiance, location and quality!"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-11-28,1,"Just purchased a sirloin sandwich at this location. After paying almost $16 I open the sandwich to discover one tiny piece of meat. I asked for the manager ""Teynia"" who was ""kind"" enough to Ofer me for refund or new improved sandwich. She was nice enough to apologize, refunded my money and take the thing that they called ""sandwich"".  Ended up spending 20 min on this and left with an apology (not a bad deal). I think that the managment should teach their shift manager how to make sure their customers happy. Even though ""Tenyia"" told me that she hope to see me soon, and the fact that I love these stores, I will never spend my time going back to this location, especially not for lunch!"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-11-27,3,"I love Maison Kayser but this location seems like a bit of an anomaly. It's a few blocks from work so I go in once a day if not more to get a pastry or coffee whenever I need a break from work. Service is kind of off--I've had orders lost or been served incorrect items multiple times, I've stood there trying to get a cashier's attention while they were on their cell phone, and every time I've gotten a rosette (I love these types of sandwiches so much) the bread has been so hard and stale. Overall I'm still positive about them because I've had a good breakfast viennois and I love their chocolate almond croissants, and I know the potential is there based on other locations. Hoping they iron out all the kinks soon."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-11-10,4,"Grand Opening Day today and looked very successful from the 8:00am rush I encountered. Lines moved fairly quickly but of course a few hiccups here and there with the availability of the baked goods.

I had my eye on the ham and cheese croissant (well, secretly the Croque Monsieur next to it but this purchase was for breakfast not lunch so I stopped myself). When I got to the register, the gal said they had to check first if they had it. Not sure why they didn't notice my confusion, as I even walked over to the glass unit to point it out, turns out those were for display.

Honestly that is ridiculous but again, opening day kinks I hope. Minutes later, I was told they didn't have any (so sigh, it really was for display?!) but I was offered another choice, the spinach Croissant. Any way, I agreed. They asked if I wanted it toasted, of course I said yes. Best way to enjoy that savory and cheesy combo. 

I also eyed a freshly baked brioche loaf, the color of the slightly glistening sweet top just begged me to buy it. My kiddos love brioche so I bought it to bring home to try.

Just tried it and it was delicious. Fluffy dough, light and airy. It smelled so good when i warned it up. A touch of sticky sweetness on top...yum.  I would totally make this a repeat trip. The spinach Croissant was very good as well. Loved my quick first visit. Am excited to try the delectable desserts I saw in the first window."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-11-08,3,Croissant was good but the lid for the cappuccino cup didn't fit. Weird. Slightly overpriced for the quality- not all that much better than starbucks
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-11-06,3,"I am a big fan of Eric Kayser's shop but this location is a bit disappointing. 

Staff needs to put their acts together. 

Cashier threw out my receipt as soon as it was printed without asking if I wanted my copy. When I said I do need my receipt it took a while for her to get it reprint. She also asked is it bad that she threw it out. 

The cake I got was not carefully placed in the box. With all the smudges of chocolate everywhere... not a happy customer walking out of the store today."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-11-04,5,Definitely happy to have this in the neighborhood. So many great choices for bread and pastry. Can't wait to try a sit down meal.
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-11-01,1,"Just opened and they need to work the kinks out. Quality of food is nowhere near their other locations. I just had a blueberry parfait for breakfast and had to throw it out after two bites. The granola was stale and the blueberry was gelatinous. Gross! Get your act together, MK!"
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-10-26,4,"So happy to see a familiar Parisien boulangerie in NY! Decided to stop in and treat myself for a civilized mid-week, sit-down lunch. It was bustling. Most were ordering take-away meals, but there is a fair amount of restaurant seating. Appears serving staff was still working out minor kinks in service, which is understandable, being still within the first week since their grand opening. I ordered the autumn salad and it was perfect. It came with a darling little ""sac"" of baguette slices and French président brand butter ... deeelish. Overall everything was very nicely done, I would have appreciated a refill of water with my meal, but they eventually did refill as I was settling the bill. A solid 4 to 4.5."
155,maison-kayser-new-york-32,2017-10-18,4,"Well I knew this Maison Kayser was under construction and waiting for the announcement about opening . but low and behold I walk by and there getting ready to open just like that.

So it a surprise Grand Opening with your typical New York City Scaffolding , and yes it's the clean Parisian Maison Kayser cafe and restaurant with all your favorites that they all carry. It has a sit down area for breakfest and lunch. I guess the new staff will be a little shaky at first before they learn about the pastries items like Apricot, Pistachio, Raspberry and Yuzu Tarts, eclairs, pistachio eclair, and also Cardinal, Cocorico, Mangodor, Adagio, Moccacino eclairs too.
And 2 dozens cakes and Pies.  Bread , different Croissants , cookies. Just too much to list.

I got a free Turkey Club Sandwich opening day and it was delicious , had tomato, lettuces, hard boil eggs slices, and bacon too.

And there is competition too , Paris Baguette is two doors down, and a Au Bon Pain across the street in case the price or palate is to your fitting instead.. So if you want rich, buttery  desserts it's M. K. is you want lite and fluffy then P. B.

But you can't go wrong by going down to 52nd & Lexington these days."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2019-12-08,5,"Great location offering nice ambiance and great food for sure 
I whish u enjoy it's as I did"
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2019-09-25,1,"It's a typical starbucks but DONT come here if you want to read, study, or get work done- the music is very loud- it sounds more like a bar than a coffee shop. While I love Justin Bieber hits as much as the next millennial- I don't to need be feeling the bass while trying to study. I can hear the music over my earplugs and headphones with my music turned all the way up."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2019-07-23,2,Coffee tastes like battery acid.Employees are intolerant liberal bullies who hate police officers and military personnel and vets. Stick to Dunkins
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2018-08-06,2,"Very little seating, almost always full. Iced coffee also tends to still be warm, melting ice and watering it down. Try one of the other nearby locations."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2017-11-10,3,I have seen roaches at this Starbucks on two separate occasions. I understand that this is NYC ... but get it together!
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2017-09-07,4,"This Starbucks puts in Work. Servicing John Jay, Fordham, and the local hospital, these baristas work nonstop to deliver good drinks in under 3 minutes! (In my experience)"
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2017-08-08,3,"Usually mobile orders are pretty fast. Night time is when services slows down a lot and heads downhill. I did a mobile order recently in the evening and when I went to pick it up, no one acknowledged me, then they couldn't find my order, then they told me they were out and I had to pick something else"
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2017-06-12,4,This place is convenient and they are generally pretty nice. It's not unlike other Starbucks although I will say that the bathroom at this one was pretty gross... I think it's because many people simply have found it. As with many Starbucks in New York City it's generally pretty narrow and people have no sense of self-awareness so you have to maneuver through crowd when you want to order. Otherwise same old Starbucks different location ..it's fine.
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2017-05-21,2,"Eh, I have been to better Starbucks locations. Especially those that have some actual real seating.

Tiny location with a few tables and some window seating to watch the talent walk by. Got my iced coffee and grabbed the last possible open seat at the window to cool off on a hot NYC day. The other 3-4 small round tables were taken up by wifi hogs nursing their drinks so they weren't leaving any time soon.

Nothing special here. Average at best."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2017-05-03,5,"This is probably my favorite starbucks in town! They recognize me, include me, appreciate me, support me and most of all they DELIGHT ME!"
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2016-11-18,5,"It's hard to review a Starbucks because it can be a shitshow at any given location at any time, and because they're a chain. I visit this particular Starbucks 4-5 days a week and I feel I've been there enough to get a feel for the place. 

I'm part of the 6:30-7 crowd, give or take, and it's always a nice experience at this location. The staff is friendly and seem to be on top their game. I haven't caught all their names, but Rachel is very nice and does a great job! 

The place seems well run, and it's always pretty clean. The milk and creamers are generally topped off, and that area is kept clean for the most part. 

I do love Starbucks but some locations more than others, ya know what I mean?! That pretty much wraps it up; this location is clean, well-run, and the staff are nice and know what they're doing! See ya guys in the morning on my way to work."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2016-09-11,2,"Had to wait more than 10 minutes for my order in which they got wrong - in the morning - when people in a rush. I was just going to walk out, they shouldn't be acting like this 
Doesn't Starbucks have standards ???
More like star sucks 
You guys are becoming more like Dunkin Donuts 
Fuckin - ridiculous"
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2016-06-16,2,"Today, no decaf traditional coffee. No whole milk. This is at 4pm. What else will they run out of over the next few hours? The staff is, as usual, delightful."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2016-03-10,5,"For once Starbucks nailed it! Decided to go take advantage of my free birthday drink and wet with the usual grande cinnamon dolce latte along with a chocolate chip cookie.

Te drink was perfect, wasn't heavy on the foam, and needed absolutely no sugar. You know its good when you don't have to put sugar!

Place still looked clean after its recent reno and it wasn't crowded when I had gone in.

This is a big one here, the staff was kind, courteous, and respectful. It looked as if they mightve enjoyed their job and weren't hood.

I'd definitely be back.

Good job guys."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2016-01-03,2,"Cool vibe but not comfortable with staff just singing out loud songs playing.  Some people go there to do work or relax, not for an unwanted concert."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2015-11-04,3,"Ok - so it has been a year since my last trip to the city and having been to this location at least 3x over the past weekend, I feel the need to add an additional star to my review.

Yes this location is still crowded but the baristas behind the counter were pleasant (and even singing) each time I frequented this location.  Music from their sound system was on point and the store itself was clean regardless of when I was there.

If and when I get back to the city I will now not be wary of getting my caffeine fix at this location"
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2015-04-14,1,"I was treated like dirt here. 
Plus they know jack-shit about what they are doing.
Avoid at all costs."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2015-02-15,1,"Today I went in while visiting NYC with my wife and were staying up the street. I witnessed probably the most egregious interactions between two co workers I have ever seen at any Starbucks and probably any service oriented business. My wife ordered a blonde coffee which she said was delicious and in the middle of our transaction the barista who was a very large black woman barked at the cashier and asked her what the cup by the coffee machines with the tea bag was. The cashier answered that it was for a misto. The large black woman than ripped her apart in the most rude way making her out to be an idiot for doing that. She told her that ""it is not my job to open tea bags"" and that how could she think that anyone would ever know that was supposed to be a misto. She then told her she had to put water in it and then put in the line for the bar drinks. She then continued to tell other co workers how dumb the cashier was and how ridiculous it was she put a tea bag there. The cashier was obviously a new member and didn't know any better but NEVER should that type of conversation be had in front of customers or in front of the house period. 

After this interaction it looked like the cashier was about to cry so my wife and I tried to console her and tell her that he barista was mean and that she was awesome.

The large mean black woman should be fired. I can't believe this was allowed in front of customers. Starbucks you can do better hiring people, that woman should never have been hired."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2015-01-22,1,Jaclyn at the counter was incredibly rude. I hate this Starbucks so much lol they're always so rude here
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2015-01-18,5,"I must say, I am quite surprised by some of the reviews below. I have been a frequent customer at this Starbucks for a little over a year now as I have a client who is near by. The staff are always super friendly to the point some of the baristas know my name and order.  The location on W 58th across from Time Warner is probably more convenient for where I need to go, however, the line at this location is usually fairly short and quick, with the exception of  days when there are groups of tourists coming through."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2014-11-26,2,TINY with limited seating.  Was meeting someone for a business matter here but this is not the ideal location for that.  Cleanliness left something to be expected though I had no issues getting my food & beverage here.  Not my preferred Starbucks; I'm not even sure they had a bathroom in this one.
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2014-10-11,1,"Here's a big ugly shout-out to the rude girl who worked on September 5th around 4:45, when I told her gave me the wrong size ice tea, said, ""This is what you ordered."" I told her the man who took my order put the wrong size in and she started arguing with me. I took the iced tea and walked away. One sip and I realized it was the wrong tea. I ordered black tea and she poured me mint. I walked back in and told her it was the wrong tea. ""That's black!! That's what you ordered!!"" I tossed the entire thing in the trash on the way out.  Screw this place if that's the kind of employees they have working there. Short black girl in her 20's making drinks. Never again."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2014-10-11,5,Great staff and amenities. I love the location in Hells Kitchen and right near Columbus Circle. They have WiFi available for your work needs. Great place
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2014-09-18,1,"The worst service. Every time I come here its extremely slow to get your drink even though 90% of the people that go in there are from nearby LARGE publishing companies... we have things to do! Not joking when I tell you as I waited for my Pumpkin Spice Latte (should be easy.. it's that season...) I saw a woman behind the counter (barely behind but still behind the counter, and not wearing a uniform) COMBING her hair. So gross. I feel like that must violate a lot of cleanliness laws no? Not to mention I was the last person standing there when I had ordered before all of the people who got their drinks previous to me. I had to remind them I ordered, and asked where my drink was as I had a meeting. No response, the girl made my drink and just my luck, I get back to my office to find that there was no coffee in my drink. Just milk that was warm and not even foamy, and pumpkin spice liquid. So beyond disappointed. I also want to add that while im heated as im writing this, I was so beyond polite in the store and didn't receive that same courtesy. I also watched as an employee clearly on break walked from behind the counter to chat with his co-workers slam right into a patron and wait for her to apologize to him. This place is so bad, I won't return, even though I work right there! 

PS. Starbucks... look at your reviews on here and maybe adjust your staff accordingly? Clearly this store isn't going well. Maybe find some employees who actually are happy to have a job."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2014-08-07,1,Waited until I visited a few times to be sure it wasn't just a lack of caffeine - but this is absolutely the slowest Starbucks in manhattan.
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2014-07-15,1,"The coffee at the location does not seem to be of the same quality as other locations. The grande coffee I got this morning is very weak and actually tastes like dishwater. The staff were not happy or engaged,  making the atmosphere rather depressing.  Next time I will walk the extra blocks to go to the one at Columbus circle."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2014-06-25,1,"Hard to give a Starbucks one star BUT - the staff at this branch are so rude and clearly don't want to be there - in fact after ranting because some customer was not acknowledging their order, the lady serving me told me ""I am so over this job"".  Plenty other choices in NYC of people who do want their jobs - bye bye Starbucks"
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2014-05-28,3,"Standard starbucks store, got my drinks quickly and place was clean. However, the wifi here is soooooooooo slow so don't expect to get much work done here on your laptop."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2014-05-27,1,"The reason I normally go to starbucks (and not a local coffee shop) is usually because I'm in a rush and don't have time to go out of my way. 

I certainly didn't have time to stand and wait to get my iced coffee for 15 minutes... c'mon there was one person in front of me. There was 3 baristas working and it still took eons to get my coffee.

Worst customer service starbucks I've been to."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2014-04-14,2,"Staff here seriously struggling today. Customers getting wrong orders, charged for 2 instead of 1... And clearly getting annoyed with each other too."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2013-12-29,4,"This Starbucks is a hot mess. But I always go in if I see Connie or Tyler in the store. Connie is always friendly and helpful, she just makes my day whenever I get my latte from her. Tyler is also very friendly and serves coffee with a smile.  I just pass this place by if I don't see them in there. The rest of the staff could learn a lot from their examples."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2013-11-17,2,"It would have been a perfectly nice SB if it weren't for Connie. She's horrible: rude, unfriendly and without any sense of customer service. Where's the manager?"
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2013-07-23,4,i'm gonna be real here. i only came here to poop when i worked down the block and was too grossed out by the bathroom at my job. nice clean bathroom. line was never too bad considering there's another bigger starbucks like a block away. good place to make stool. a+.
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2013-07-05,2,"What a bad Starbucks. Yes there are others around the area, but this is closest for me. They are so slow with no sense of urgency. Drinks are mediocre. When they are busy, they don't measure anything out. Watched the ""barista"" getting flustered the other day and have a meltdown. Entertaining? yes, but I just wanted my shaken, shaked and iced, cold. It almost seems like since this is in a low-key location that they feel they could staff it with lesser qualified employees...whatever."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2013-01-30,3,"""Amorfa""

Great starbucks. Quick and efficient. I was in and out. But if you wanted to stay, you could definitely make a temporary home here in this cozy starbucks located on side street right below columbus circle."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2012-08-08,1,"I went there today and ordered iced latte. From the beginning the girl who works there wasn't really nice. After I paid for my order she just continued talking with her co-worker. When I followed her to get my latte she remembered that she supposed to make a latte for me. Then she just started to laugh that she forgot to make a latte for me. And I was the only one client in there! After she made me latte she just threw it on the table which was completely outrageously! So I immediately said ""Sorry, I don't want it. Just cancel my order please"". And only after that she realized she was wrong and started to be nice. But it was too late.
I went to another Starbucks at Columbus Circle, and got my latte with much better service."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2012-01-25,4,nice and cozy feeling. came here a lot when i worked next door. workers are friendly. but very chatyish at times
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2011-03-30,3,"This is a completely average Starbucks, but it will do in a pinch.  I am an EOCD (Equal Opportunity Coffee Drinker), and have no set schedule or coffeehouse affiliation.  Local? Sure.  Corporate?  Sure.  The bottom line: I hate shitty coffee.

With all of that said, this Starbucks location was simply, well, Starbucks.  The people working made an average capp with average foam.  It did the trick.  My only real gripe is the layout/location/active construction zone."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2011-03-04,4,"I sort of find it pointless reviewing it as Starbucks is well...Starbucks. But I'm a regular at this place so just wanted to say, the employees here are always nice and cheerful. I love Steve! They know my order too well - is that a good thing or a bad thing?

Right now there's construction going right in front on so it's not really nice sitting inside, especially while they're drilling. BUT....there's a really hot young Latino construction worker who makes sitting inside worth it. He's worth all the horrible noise and vibrations."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2010-04-14,3,"I perversely like this Starbucks, especially in the morning when suited men and women queue up in silent lines, waiting for their coffee in the gloom."

Thank you for taking the time to write to us about the unacceptable experience you had at our store.  

The behavior our cashier demonstrated is not our practice and will be addressed immediately. Any details you can provide around your visit would be greatly appreciated (time of visit, description of cashier). 

There is no reason for you to have experienced a dirty store, wet items placed next to your laptop and rude employees. I will address this with the store manager immediately.

156,starbucks-new-york-500,2008-11-10,5,"I'm not typically douchey enough to review a Starbucks - they all serve the same stuff.

But girl the employees here are off the chain!  My friend and I were browsing the mugs (they had cute ones with cable-knit design on them!) and the employee came out to help us browse their retail products.  She then offered us her employee discount if we wanted - 30% off.  Whoa!

I also inquired about the new ""Gold Card"" 'Bucks is pushing.  The barista quickly asserted it was a rip-off and suggested to pass on it.  I love employee honesty, even when it's at their employers' expense.

To the other reviewer on here:  your fault for ordering a vanilla latte."
156,starbucks-new-york-500,2008-02-04,1,"In my younger years I used to think that Starbucks was the only coffee out there. Now I have wised up and realized that a latte is not supposed to taste burnt and full of artificial flavorings. But sometimes that fabulous local coffee place is far away...sometimes you just NEED a caffeine fix. 

Next time that I think about walking into a Starbucks please remind me of my 2 most recent experiences. Man...I need to learn how to make a latte at home!

1. Went to Starbucks got a Vanilla Latte. Paid with a $10 (I know this because I had just paid for a cab and KNEW what was in my purse). The girl behind the counter gave me change like I had paid with a $5. I explained I paid with a $10. She rudely explained that I must be wrong because look at the receipt it says $5. Yes I explained...that is because maybe you pushed the wrong key....and on and on and on. I finally gave up because I did not have any tolerance for her rudeness that day and a line was growing behind me. PS...after all that trouble the coffee was horrendous.

2. Went to meet a friend the other day at this Starbucks. I was waiting for her near the entrance and had not sat down or ordered anything. All the sudden everyone was yelling and jumping up on their chairs. There in front of me was a HUGE dogsize rat running around the store. The starbucks employee got out a broom and shoo-ed the rat TOWARDS ME!!! Needless to say I did not order anything that day!

So please...if you see my on the street and I am about to walk into a starbucks...slap me."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2019-11-20,1,"NO PUBLIC BATHROOM

They turned the public bathroom to a staff only bathroom. And there's boxes everywhere that they try to deter people from going there."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2019-09-08,1,"No bathroom, very disrespectful, and played inappropriate music very loud. Unprofessional."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2019-08-21,1,"GO TO ANY OTHER COFFEE SHOP WITHIN A TWO BLOCK RADIUS! There are like 6 other coffee spots including two other Starbucks. 

The people working behind the bar are regularly amazing and so sweet! But there is a female barista who regularly looks actually angry at me for ordering my grande coffee black (the easiest order on the menu). She is rude, I've seen her speak rudely to all the customers in line, and behave with a general annoyance that anyone would dare order anything at this establishment. Today She was so overboard on her attitude that a customer and I shared a physical response to her behavior. To that end I just stopped by and ordered an item that needs to be heated up- she charged me and then gave no instructions or made no moves to heat the item. It wasn't until one of the guys asked me that the order was filled. Honestly this site is convenient but I'll go to pret or au bob pain because this chick is scary. 

I thought I had posted this review awhile ago but I guess it never went through. I returned to this review because once again this location never fails to up itself in shitty service and completely ruin your day. I rarely go to this location specifically because I know the baristas will put me in a shitty mood. Today my barista Joe full on said ""I'm telling you what we have"" when I asked for a cheese croissant because I thought it was a new item listed in the case, he said we don't have that and I was I was co fused but before I could even go and relook he was annoyed and agitated that a customer would be so dumb. His response was so rude I had to take a step back and genuinely looked at him like are you serious? This guy needs to never work in customer service again if he can't handle something so insignificant or treat people with respect. Truthfully this is the last time I will step foot in this location because clearly the management team either sucks at hiring or training, or it's so terrible to work at this Starbucks that the baristas have to take out their anger on customers. 

Honestly walk down the block and go to Gregory's- those baristas are so friendly, or try Pret a block away- their customer service is amazing, but do not waste a dime on this garbage Starbucks with nasty humans."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2019-08-09,2,"No bathroom!! What in the world?? There isn't a lot of seating and the place is pretty dirty. If you don't mind cleaning up the tables you want to sit at and not going to the bathroom, you'll be good here. 

The gentleman who served me was nice.. especially for a New Yorker in the customer service industry. Like, he gets a 10/10 for NY but a 7/10 for everywhere else in the world, hahaha."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2019-07-13,1,"Didnt even get a chance to order because staff is so RUDE!!!!! 5 mins before closing and i was told i couldnt order ""maybe next time"" THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ... smh NEVER AGAINNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2019-06-23,1,The worst starbucks experience I've ever had! I waited half an hour for a coffee. One poor lady is preparing all coffees alone and others are just chilling.
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2019-04-02,1,"Even with mobile order you wait up to 20 minutes here consistently. Not worth it, go next door. They need to figure out how to be faster."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2019-01-30,2,Staff is rude and very unfriendly if you have an accent. The cashier made a mistake and I politely asked her and she gave me a bad look and didn't correct it. Very disrespectful
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2018-11-25,1,"I never had a barista/anyone be that rude to me a
In that short an amount of time.  Working in the hospitality industry the way this guy acted was totally unreasonable."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2018-09-23,3,This Starbucks was ok. Every time I went in here most of the employees were talking about things they should not be. The manager was screaming at her employees to make drinks and it was not just one time. Coffee tasted great but the atmosphere was not great.
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2018-07-27,1,"Just walked into this Starbucks not too long ago and they told me that they are closed! How do you close your store 30 minutes before closing! If your store says you close at 12am then you should close at that time. This location is a disgrace to the Starbucks corporation and the employees there aren't friendly at all. One of the employees stated that someone was coming ""to do something"" which is why they closed early but I knew she was just lazy and wanted to leave early. You shouldn't hire employees who don't want to work and do their job. I never write a bad review or a review at all but I was very disappointed with my experience here. After we left we also noticed that they kept turning people away. What a joke! This Starbucks either needs to be closed down or you need to hire better night shift employees!! Also their door stated that they close at 12am!!"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2018-07-25,1,"This was the first Starbucks I went to in New York. The service was fast and the waitress was nice, however they missed half of my order and charged me three dollars extra, which was stupid but whatever"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2018-06-25,3,Some harsh reviews here and at the time of writing mine it was down to 2.5 stars.  The service I had was great and we were able to snag a little window seats for a family of 4 on Sunday morning at 9am.  Service was quick and the order was right.  I'm taking off two stars because as many mention NO BATHROOM!
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2018-04-04,2,"I come to this sbux because it is the closet to my job...but I think I'll just go to the one on 57th from now on. Some of the staff are extremely rude..on top of that, they are inefficient! never again!"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2018-03-28,1,It took them freaking 25 mins to give me my bagel order. That too after reminding them twice. Worst staff ever!
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2018-01-05,1,"Never write reviews, but I feel like I'd be doing the public a disservice if I didn't publicly document my AWFUL experience here. Seriously, DON'T GO HERE. I usually don't really care about the services of eating/beverage establishments unless it's blaringly bad, but the staff here is BRUTAL. SOOOOOOO UNFRIENDLY AND RUDE. They don't crack a smile, not to mention they don't really know what they're doing. It takes forever to get your drink and chances are, they'll screw it up. Definitely a horrrrible Starbucks. Shouldn't be on Broadway. Also, my veggie egg white bites are burnt every. Single. Time. Save yourself some money and go to the Starbucks down the street!



EDIT: just tried my coffee and it's cold. Bye."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2017-12-18,3,"No bathroom??? Fail! 

Should I pee on the floor after drinking my two coffees? 

Does the staff hold it in all day here? 

Overall, it's a decent Starbucks location but don' expect to get a seat as there is hardly and to be found here other than a community table, a few high tops, and some seats along the window. Some outlets. Seemed clean enough. Staff was ok on my visit. Wifi worked well.

Wasn't all that busy the night I was here and took a spot by the window to do some work on my computer. Still, after two coffees I needed to pee! Good thing I found a diner to use close by.

Relief!"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2017-09-21,1,"This was the first Starbucks I walked into in New York. My Wife ordered her usual..Trenta Green Tea Lemonade, 2 Sweet n Low, No Ice. The Barista told her the Drink would not be filled to the top..""is that ok?"". We both said no..she then explained it was a rule set by Corporate, and not her rule. I asked to speak with the Manager, who also said it was a Corporate rule. When I asked for the District Manager info, they looked at me oddly and blurted out a name..I asked for an email or business card and they would not provide it. They said over and over, it's a corporate rule, not ours. 

We left and Visited another Starbucks. We inquired about that policy and the said no it's not. We then made our purchase and went on. Maybe this Starbucks has been overusing their Teal allotment? And are you saying when I purchase a Trenta, I am only
getting a Venti? Or worse a Grande? And the product is being substituted with Ice? Sounds like a great scam they have to keep the numbers up? Not sure what the motive is? But the low customer rating is obvious there not doing things the right way.  Vey disappointed and I hope Starbucks Corp takes a look at this."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2017-06-23,1,WHO IS THE MANAGER HERE? (If they even have one) Every time I go they take at least 15 minutes to make my drink WRONG. The staff is beyond rude and have loud side conversations no one needs to hear. This location is in serious need of new management.
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2017-06-20,3,Please don't tell me you don't have Blonde coffee when you are hanging the sign.  You can always make a pour over.  And that's exactly what your about to do.
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2017-06-02,1,"The staff and service are pathetic, my ice coffee was barely drinkable and the service just pitiful. The won't let you give less than 1 star"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2017-05-28,2,I ordered a hot green tea.  The temperature at which the tea was served to me was entirely way too hot. I couldn't even hold the cup with the sleeve on it. Seriously that could really burn someone's skin and it's not okay.   The staff was friendly though!
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2017-05-13,1,"Well as I have found not all Starbucks are the same. 
RUDE workers. 
Slamming things. 
Rolling eyes. 
Ignoring customers at the register to go in back room and yell at each other. 
I ordered a Coffee Frap with Sugar Free Vanilla, it was runny and nasty. I watched them make it and she short pulled the pumps. That DOES effect the taste!!!
Waste of my $5.00!!"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2017-03-15,1,"Andre has a MAJOR attitude problem. It's bad enough this location is always super busy, but his bad attitude when politely asked a question is not appreciated. 

There's another girl there who is wonderful. They ran out of drink trays and she rigged me one of of a pastry holder. I will update with her name when I get it next time."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2017-03-10,1,"I went in three times in one week. The first time the barista was rude. The second time they were out if caramel. Really??  The third time I was told they did not have apple juice for the apple chi I ordered. In addition another customer had accidentally knocked a glass coffee pot over and broke it. Two of the employees were very rude to her. It was a complete accident. The chairs were so close to the display, it could have happened at any time.    During my week stay in NYC I visited 3 other Starbucks that provided excellent service. I hate that this one was located right at the hotel we were staying."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2016-12-27,1,"I have never been so utterly disrespected at an establishment before in my life until yesterday. My family and I had been traveling through New York all day and decided to stop at this Starbucks for a refreshment before heading to see the tree. This was a POOR choice on our behalf, the experience was horrid from start to finish. While waiting to place our drink orders, an employee made a comment about ""the blenders being down"" based on my suggestion to my boyfriend to order a Frappuccino. Another member of my family was placing their drink order and was told that the holiday drinks were no longer available, despite the visual advertisements still being displayed throughout the entire store. When my family member mentioned to me that we could not get the drink we both wanted the employee that previously made a comment to my family once again chimed in and made another comment towards us. At this point my family and I were feeling a bit uncomfortable with this employee continuously commenting on our personal conversations. This eventually led to a verbal disagreement between my family member and the employee who felt it was appropriate to use foul language and make side comments towards us in a loud tone. I have never been so uncomfortable and dissatisfied with an experience in my entire life!!!!! The hostile environment was so unbearable that I decided to get off line and not purchase anything at this store. I will never return to this Starbucks and hope that this establishment corrects their employees' behavior ASAP before they run all of their customers away!"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2016-12-11,3,"Food: 3.5/5.0
Service: 3.0/5.0
Value: 3.0/5.0
Decor: 3.0/5.0
Overall: 3.5/5.0 

Very standard Starbucks.  Nice to grab a stool by the window if you have some time to kill."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2016-10-29,1,"The Worst Starbucks! Why I have to give at least star?! And the staff always using her phone when I ordered. What's more, she couldn't understand what my said."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2016-08-21,1,The staff here never fails to surprise me at how inefficient and slow they can be.  They appear to remain in an utter state of confusion.  Please allocate an additional 5-8 minutes of waiting time whenever you come here.
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2016-06-27,1,"I ordered a just turkey sandwich for breakfast and literally waited about 10min to get. 

There were people waiting forever to get their drinks and it was packed bc of the superrrr slow service. 

To top it off, they had about 5 staff members working, which doesn't make sense for the slow service. 

This is the first time I've ever experienced this time of slow service at Starbucks."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2016-05-03,5,"Best Starbucks in the city.  My drink has never been wrong in the 3-4 years I've been coming here daily.  It's regularly crowded (locals, tourists, and work-folks alike) & the staff makes an effort to keep the lines moving and the drinks coming. Well done!"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2016-04-29,5,My favorite location in the whole entire NYC! The team at this location is always so welcoming and remember me and what I like to drink every time I stop in. My favorite team member is Max. She always greets me with a smile and the warmest hugs if it isn't busy. Not to mention they always have me trying to mixes of flavors which always sends my mouth into a frenzy. Definitely one of if not the best Starbucks location here in NYC.
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2016-01-17,3,"I read the other reviews about this location and I have to agree with them. The staff here looks like they hate their job. What makes each Starbucks store stand out are the people that work there and this location lacks the friendly environment. I know they have to deal with rude customers everyday but it's how you handle the situation that defines you. It could also be poor management. Take care of your employees and they will take care of your clients. With that being said, this place needs improvement in service."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2015-10-26,1,"This store has the rudest staff I have ever encountered at a Starbucks. It's one thing to be really busy and make your customers wait 20 min for a coffee, it's another to be screaming and fighting with other employees in front of customers and then act angry towards the customers for getting impatient for their drinks after waiting 20 min. No thank you."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2015-08-06,5,"I have been hitting this Starbucks every day for nearly 6 years. And with 4 others, equally convenient from my office, why do I choose this one? In the middle of tourist hell midtown Manhattan? Because the staff is amazing. This morning I walked in, quite sick, and just from the sound of my congested voice Sacha recommended a green tea for me instead of my regular coffee, and told everyone that I was sick. Before I left, just about every employee at the store took the time to tell me to feel better. It's just nice. Even when the staff turns over, they tell the new employees, ""That's John, he comes in every day, and this is what he gets..."" and every day, it's ready for me, and I am greeted with a smile and good energy. Yeah the line gets long. Yeah the space is crowded. It doesn't matter to me. I'll glad wait the extra few minutes to get treated like that. Especially since Carlos, Laverne, Dillon, Sacha, Gloria, Joel, Lavon, Danny, Kenny, and the rest of them often have to deal with lines out the door, people who can't speak English, rudeness, tight quarters, spilled drinks, and everything else that comes with the territory. I love this place. If I ever change jobs and relocate far from here I will be sad as hell."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2015-07-13,1,busy starbucks area...! people who works here are so rude...!!!!!! they have to listen carefully...!!!!!!!!!!!! mean service...!!!!!!!!!!!!!
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2015-07-08,1,"I'm very disappointed in this Starbucks .... I'm a huge Starbucks drinker... I'm a Gold member that should say it all!!!  I have never had an issue nor a compliant .....but today !!!! We came in party of 7 / 2 kids, we all ordered drinks!! Shall I say we all paid for STARBUCKS DRINKS .... Our kids had pancakes that we bought down the street, we had them eat on the go cause we had a schedule to follow, so I had the kids eat their pancakes while waiting for our drinks when some lady who works here RUDELY came and told us they could t eat here they had to go!!! WTHeck!! I totally get if its a policy but she could of nicely made us aware of the policy!!! OR just in general approached us in a different manner! 

If I could give them NO stars I would! 

We stood in New York 5 days and passed this Starbucks everyday but walked further to another Starbucks..... I refuse to give my business to a place that has no customer service!!"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2015-04-19,1,Starbucks reviews? Why?  Everyday I wake up cranky and coffee corrects this.  For the 4th weekend in a row this 'bucks has made me crankier. 4 people working and only one taking orders - the line grows and so does my fury. Clearly a management problem.
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2015-02-27,4,I have been to this Starbucks twice and I absolutely love the staff in the morning (since that's when I only go )! The staff is always upbeat and always are singing to the music that they play and is just a place to brighten up your morning.  The service is also pretty fast when it is busy. When I have business I'm they city I would definitely come back again!
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2015-02-09,4,"One of the Barista's greeted me in his regular upbeat fashion, my groan was a desperate ploy for a response to him. Having an undeservingly bad weekend and playing out the demanding upcoming work week had left my mind clouded. It was evident that I was  desperately in a need for a laugh. After brewing my regular drip, he stopped what he was doing and asked me if everything was OK. I guess the exhaustion on my face shined bright and he immediately followed up with ""have you heard the one about a shipwreck."" Understanding his question was in reference to a joke, I said ""no."" He delivered the joke perfectly causing the coffee that I just sipped on to come snorting out of my nostril. Needless to say, I walked out of the shop smiling all the way to the office. This is the model customer service that businesses need to teach and instill in their employees, knowing your customers and using the personal touch effectively. Yes, the coffee is pricey - but it is really good, the service is quick and the staff goes above and beyond for their customers. This place is the best coffee shop I have had the pleasure of visiting."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2014-11-09,5,"This is my favorite Starbucks to get coffee fix. The staff here (Rabeen, Avon, Gloria, and Dillon) are extremely polite friendly, they work fast and always make my drinks EXACTLY how I like it."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2014-11-02,2,"Not the best set up here. There's a tiny nook to walk through after you've made your order. What happens if someone can't squeeze through there!? It doesn't help that this Starbucks attracts ALOT of lost and confused tourists. In my attempts to get a quick coffee, there are always tourists in the way. And sometimes the baristas take a very long time to make a coffee. I've stood there for almost 15 minutes, many of times!!"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2014-09-08,5,"The Starbucks always moves quickly and efficiently. You can tell the baristas are happy to be there but not standing around and interesting more in each other than the customers like other locations. Also, I have never had my order messed up!"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2014-07-01,1,"Unenthusiastic staff. We were here as a quick drink stop before heading to Central Park. The girl who served me sounded like it was the worst day of her life. Her monotone voice put me off, especially as a tourist. She took my order, which was a Venti Very Berry Hibiscus and Tall ice water, almost grudgingly. I had initially asked for a Venti ice water, but she gave this lame excuse for not being able to provide it. If I'm paying $5 for another drink, what is the harm of using a Venti cup for the water? Our drinks took too long for something so simple and plus they weren't even busy. Perhaps one of the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. Pro-tip: If you're heading to Central Park, just grab a $2 drink from any of the dozen of vendors at or around the park. It's cheaper and faster and you don't have to put up with staff found at this place."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2014-06-09,3,"The setup here is not great.  There's a tiny space to squeeze through between where you order and pick up.

I like the one on the corner of 54th & Broadway better.

Having said that, last time I was here the service was fast and friendly."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2014-03-03,2,"Unfortunately, this is the closest Starbucks by my job. Unfortunately, I'm almost always late for work when I stop at this Starbucks. Unfortunately, my tardiness to work is never my fault. This Starbucks takes FORRRREEEVVVVEERRR! I understand there's a morning rush, but geesh! I treat myself to Starbucks about once a week or so and I HATE knowing I have to come to this one. Don't get me wrong. The staff is super nice and it seems like they are really trying to keep it together, buttttttt something isn't working back there."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2013-07-14,5,The people here are so nice. I have never been to a friendlier Starbucks. They were also fast and accurate. A+++
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2013-04-03,2,"I went to this Starbucks for the first time today hoping I could just pop in for a coffee that could accompany me as I walk to school.  I've always passed by it but thought it looked really nice and airy inside.  It turns out I should have kept passing by it.

I felt like I was in there for an hour waiting for my order to be taken although there were only about three people ahead of me in line.  The service was unnecessarily slow; she was taking her sweet time fulfilling orders - just doing everything very slowly from putting the pastries into the oven to heat, to retrieving cake pops, with none of the other two or three present employees helping speed up the process.

Finally my order was taken, and now came part two of the waiting game.  The lady making the drinks was nearly six orders behind, and each drink took her SO LONG to prepare and serve.  I couldn't believe this, because I've been to Starbucks with ONE person working much faster than this crew, like the Starbucks in the Target where I work.

I eventually got my cinnamon dolce latte...and guess what?  It wasn't even worth the wait at all because it was the first time I've ever had a badly prepared coffee from Starbucks - it definitely tasted subpar and not at all like my usual cinnamon dolce.  I was now running so late for class, and for what - a crappy (and fortunately free [thank you Starbucks Gold]) cinnamon dolce latte that took at least fifteen minutes to get (I swear I'm not exaggerating).  Slow and disorganized service means I will never return to this location.  They get a star for the pretty shop, though - it's a sort of large and open space with a good amount of seating.

I'll definitely stick with my usual spot a couple blocks up on W 58th."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2011-12-03,4,Excellent and friendly service. Small cafe. Very busy!
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2011-06-24,3,"Typical start bucks. Bad service, but it is a star bucks. Hey whatever you get to sit in there and just drink coffee and go online. At least it isn't as crazy crowded."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2011-06-15,5,"Why the bad reviews? I've been here twice for breakfast (since our hotel is right across the street). The service is wonderful, friendly and the latte is made just right. Not overly sugary like some starbucks!

Oh and how wonderful that there's free wii-fii!"
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2010-03-12,1,Crappy service. They made us a different drink than we ordered and didn't seem like the standard Starbucks crew. A bit sloppy.
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2009-11-21,4,"I'm not one to normally review Starbucks, but...

This Starbucks is open until Midnight most days of the week and is only a couple of blocks from Times Square.  They've got a pretty large space with plenty of seating.  This is a great place to park yourself for a bit if you need the Wi-Fi."
157,starbucks-new-york-176,2008-12-04,1,"There was nothing wrong with my coffee or the service I received. What was amazingly wrong was the price of my coffee. I assume, because of their location, that they charged me an extra $0.53 from every other Starbucks I've ever been to, including other Starbucks in Manhattan. I asked for the receipt, checked the menu and sure enough they just charge too much.

I recommend walking a bit further to not be gouged."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2020-02-05,4,"Low key & convenient plenty of seating and lighting, while here on a lunch break, workers took advantage of the down time & made sure the place was kept clean. Free Wifi access & Baskin Robbins also for ice cream. This spot is usually a hang out for John Jay students. Since it has an outlet in the seating area, but overall a lil above average spot on the west side of manhattan."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2019-09-19,1,Terrible service from Javed! Super rude men! Disrespectful!! Never be back in this place! Cultural disrespect towards women!
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2019-08-23,1,"The worst!!! I was being helped with ice cream by an employee who was on his phone. He then stepped away leaving me and my kids wondering where he went. I asked the other employee who wasn't present for the past 3 minutes, leaving the store empty and causing a line of unhappy customers. Standing in line I asked him where his co-worker was. He dismissed me and mumbled I don't know. I then asked him if he could help me with my order. He points to the line behind me and said get in line. I told him there was no one here helping and I was the first to be helped. He refused to help me with my order. He kept telling me to get in line. I felt like he wasn't being professional and wasn't willing to help. The customers behind me said just let her order. He refused. So my kids and I left. I have never been denied service in any establishment before and never have been spoken to in such a manner. I am truly disappointed with this store and sadly so are my kids who are huge Dunkin Donuts and Baskin Robbins fans. If I could give this location zero stars I would. I don't recommend this location to anyone. This location needs a refresher course on proper customer service. What a shame Dunkin Donuts. What a shame.

Also, one of the couples behind me ended up leaving too."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2019-07-31,5,Came in to get coffee and Tanvin greeted me with a huge smile and super cheery service.  Kudos to DD for having her serve the line she was extremely efficient.  This DD was real clean as well!
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2019-07-03,2,"I only like to drink DD and this one is the closet to my school. There's no others close. The amount that these employees here DONT care amazes me. They always have an attitude. They don't type your order right on the screen so when you tell them you get more of an attitude THEN when you get your coffee it's still wrong and more attitude when you tell them it's wrong and most of the times not even CLOSE. You can actually tell by their faces at the register they literally do not care about your order or their job. The orders aren't coming out right, the coffee just isn't good anymore, my friend orders French vanilla and they always give her hazelnut but she doesn't say anything Bc their rude. I keep going back hoping to get a good coffee before class, BC DAMMIT NEW YORK STUDENTS BASICALLY SURVIVE ON COFFEE but for the past 3 weeks it's just getting worse and worse. I wish someone took charge and did something"
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2019-06-30,1,"Today 06/30/19 7:15 pm I bought 1 box of original blend coffee I got everything ( cups , sugar milk and cream) and I wanna make sure that they put enough cups or not because it's not really enough ( they say 10 cups ) but not really 10 ...so I asked the guy who take and order and then he kind of give me some attitude. He says if I want 5-6 cups I have to pay for $3-$4.....my next question for him is how much does it cost per cup because last time they are not charged me. He couldn't answer my question and then he goes "" actually we didn't sell the cups if you want more we charged for $3-$4 ...my next question is "" where is the money go ?"".... I usually bought 2 big boxes of blend coffee  every morning for my crews ...never had a problem with 5 cups more ( they might count on the cups that they put milk , cream and sugar sometime ) which is I understand and don't have a problem for a few extra cups.....I work for hospitality and this is make me feel so bad for customers services...sorry at some point you have to lose your income because of a few cups."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2019-04-16,1,Came in around 5:30pm and it took about a half an hour to get a dozen (stale) donuts and get out.  Don't think we'll be back.
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2019-04-13,1,"This place is a dump with very rude employees. AVOID!

Went into here for ice cream at 8PM and despite closing time 3 hours later, employee was very inconvenienced he had to continue serving food. Very poor, unhelpful attitude. I live very close and will not be back."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2018-05-18,1,"Awful. Avoid this place. 

It's 
-Dirty! The tables are uncleaned, they're crumbs and wrappers on counters, and the trash can is overflowing on numerous occasions.

-They're rude and lacks customer service. I inquired about some of the ice cream flavors since they lacked the proper signage and it seemed as if I was annoying him by doing so.

-They don't care about people w nut allergies. The scoopers cross contaminate, and they won't bother to clean it or get a clean scooper. When requested for them to do so, I'm given resistance.

-Ice cream and coffee doesn't taste good. Even my husband who drinks Dunkin coffee religiously every day (from another location), confirmed that the coffee here tasted bad.

I'm not sure why they are still in business."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2018-05-04,4,"This was a good location. I was working In the area for a few days and this was a my breakfast spot. 
Decent sized with a decent amount of seating as well. Tables as well as counters facing the window. There are outlets here as well.
The service was fast and efficient and there's also a Baskin Robbins here as well. Everything is usually pretty fresh earlier in the day as well so I think that is the best time for any DD."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2017-09-24,1,"So I was in the mood for a donut so I decided to go to Dunkin' Donuts. Approaching the establishment I noticed one of the employees smoking a cigarette. Curious to see if he would wash his hands before returning to work so I waited. Lo and behold he just started serving customers and I asked him if he was going to wash his hands I saw you outside smoking a cigarette, and he replied no! I told him he was disgusting, And that was unsanitary and I would never come here again. What is with these restaurant allowing your employees to take cigarette breaks without washing their hands when they return to serve food. Going to start eating at home!"
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2017-07-16,1,The facility is nice and clean my issue is with the worker. There is an older Indian man working here who is super rude and yelled at me today when he got my order wrong. Super confused but definitely not a pleasant experience. I recommend going to another Location!!
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2017-06-04,1,"I'm extremely disappointed in this establishment. I ordered their new frozen coffee which I've had before, and it was delicious! However, for some reason when I got one here, it was do disgusting I had to throw it out. Very sugary, bitter coffee, there was something very wrong with it. Waste of time and money, I won't be going back to this DD."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2017-03-26,4,"Stopped in for their breakfast sandwich. I ordered their bacon, egg and cheese on an English Muffin. Service here is fast and courteous. Very good place to get coffee and donuts."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2016-08-17,2,"I visit this store about 5 days a week before heading into work.

For the past two weeks, it's been a hot box with no air conditioning, and no sign notifying customers.

The second you walk through the door-- you start sweating -- the customers are hot, the employees are hot! That mixed with the oppressive heat outside makes me want to go to Starbucks instead.

What's with the lack of A/C and the delay in getting it fixed?

You need better customer service!"
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2016-08-07,4,"We tried Trio de Janeiro and were unimpressed, instead going with the solid Oreo cereal flavor, free with the BR app. Efficient and friendly service."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2016-07-09,5,Fast service. They saw me drop and spill my large iced coffee right after picking it up and gave me a new one when they saw how upset I was!!! That's customer service!
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2016-01-02,1,This dunkin donuts has gotten so bad in quality and service. Yes they just renovated but their coffee is still bitter and one is given sour milk and there are less donuts and they get angry when you tell them the coffee is bad. You tell them again how you want your coffee and again they mess it up. I even downgrade my flavored coffee to regular coffee and they mess that up too. I miss the workers who use to be there when it first opened who were friendly and welcoming with a smile and knew how to prepare a cup of coffee.
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2015-11-21,4,"It is what it is, a Dunkin Donuts. Don't expect anything more or anything less than about average coffee and donuts. Although recently they've introduced more espresso drinks but I haven't tried it as of yet. Overall the location itself is very clean inside and out. I will return."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2015-10-04,1,"Terrible service! Baskin Robbins ice has freezer burn. The to go pints ice have the icicles in them too. Maybe the freezers turn
Off at night to save money I don't know What... but it's disgusting.. Donuts stale.. Always mess up my orders for drinks..."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2015-08-07,2,"I love myself some DD dark roast iced coffee and this seems to be the only DD in the area that actually uses classic simple syrup instead of granulated sugar in their iced coffee.  I hate it when coffee places put granulated sugar into a cold drink - it doesn't melt!

However, in the mornings, the lines at this particular DD can be at the door and there's literally only 1 person working the register (sometimes 2, depending on who is making drinks).  This makes for a 10 minute coffee run ordeal which is less than ideal.

So, I go to the DD by Columbus Circle which unfortunately uses granulated sugar, but at least I can get my coffee and be in and out within 3 minutes, line or no line.

PS: Dunkin Donuts in NYC as a whole is so inconsistent.  Sometimes, 1 sugar is the same as 3 sugars somewhere else.  They can never get it right and my coffee tastes different everyday, even at the same location!!"
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2015-06-20,3,"Ooooh!  This is a combo DD/BR.  So if you want coffee and/or donuts, you're golden.  Alternatively, if you want ice cream, you're also golden.  So basically, you're practically Fort Knox if you have coffee/donut/ice cream needs!

The space is big and fairly clean.  Service was pretty quick and my coffee was made the way I requested (large, skim, one sweet and low and a little bit of ice to cool it off enough to drink).

I've only been here once but it was okay by me.  

Stay gold, Ponyboy, stay gold.   https://youtu.be/SnZbKOc7EXA"
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2015-06-18,1,Most horrible Dunkin Donuts!! The staff is mean and gives awful awful customer service. They give you regular when you ask for decaf and will put cream in your coffee when you ask for skim all with an attitude. I usually go in there everyday but after them being so nasty and constantly messing up a simple coffee I decided I am never going back there again. If I could give them zero stars I would.
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2015-06-04,2,"These chains hire the lowest rung of the ladder workforce. If you ask for anything more than a donut be prepared to wait as another incompetent employee cannot figure out how to make a smoothie, scoop ice cream or find the straws.

Long lines seem to indicate high demand for their fattening processed food products.  But it's just lazy kids and the schlumps of society at your service. I found this to be common at most of their locations."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2015-05-13,1,"I wish there was a way to give negative stars!! Worst food service ever. I walked in with my 5 family members. We all wanted combos that came with coffee and hash browns. We specifically asked if the combos came with coffee and hash browns and the guy at the register responded with ""yes"". He even asked his co worker and she said what I assume was yes because they were speaking a different language. When i went to pick up my order. I had 1 order of hash browns and no coffees. I asked the girl what happened and she responded with ""he didn't understand when you said you wanted combos""... To which I responded ""you mean when I asked if the combos came with hashbrowns and coffee he didn't understand"" and she scowled and said ""no"". Worst customer service ever. After arguing for 5-10 minutes we left having been swindled and paying extra for no reason!"
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2015-04-02,1,Worst service very slow after all that time my sand which was cold also very sloppy   never again
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2014-06-08,1,"Honestly, worst service ever!!!!!!!!!!! Not only are they extremely inefficient and rude, they lack sensibility to do simple math or provide any kind of decent service to customers at all! Every one who works there clearly doesn't understand what the store is about (food service) or the need for customers or good reviews. Freaking jerks ruining my day. Ughhhh. How do i give negative stars?"
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2014-06-07,1,There is a shift manager named Ali who is incredibly rude and has a nasty attitude. Would not go there again because he just ruin my day with bad and unpleasant attitude.
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2014-03-26,4,"Coffee is always creamy and delicious.....I've tried Starbucks...even the blonde roast...and it still tastes wayyyyy tooo strong.......maybe my palate is just not that evolved......for me, Dunkin coffee is so much better....."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2014-03-05,1,"HANDS DOWN THE RUDEST IVE EVER BEEN TREATED IN MY LIFE. The girls working on 11/2/2013 have no business working a counter. Scowling at customers, talking rudely and shaking bags at people is terrible customer service. I should have stuck to Rex across the street."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2013-01-05,1,"I stopped in this evening for two donuts to go: a French crueller and a jelly. Fumbling with my purse and wallet, I didn't notice the donuts being handled or packaged, but when I got home I found that they had been thrown into the brown paper bag--no tissue or napkins wrapping the donuts to keep them separate from each other and from the surface of the paper bag. Disgusting. Then I wondered if the clerk had even used tissue to take the donuts from the tray and transfer them into the bag; I suspect he used his bare hands. I gave the donuts a quick nuking to kill the germs before eating.

Nasty, and the donuts were stale, to boot. First and last visit"
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2012-12-08,5,"Quick, friendly service. 

Peppermint mocha iced latte = SOO GOOD!! (I do ask for them to put an extra pump of peppermint in there, it's the best)

They are open late, they have donuts, and baskin robbins is in there too."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2012-10-17,1,"Refused us service for no reason... was it racism?? was it just because he didn't want to make a shake?? I don't know, but I'm NEVER going into a DD again.  This location on 10th ave and 55th st. has at least one good employee, but the one that flat out refused us service lost our business for a LIFETIME. When we complained to 'corporate' they gave us a reply that said we brought a dog into the location!! we don't have a dog!!!"
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2012-10-02,1,Worst chain location ever. I brought my son here and he was throwing a tantrum for a doughnut and this a-hole from bangladash told him to shut up. What an animal!
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2012-06-24,2,"I went in this store today with a friend because she wanted the coffee. She sat down (she's 91) while I went to get it for her. I joked to one guy that air conditioning would be a great idea...he didn't know English enough to respond. I sighed and went to someone else who made the coffee for me and spoke English. Fellas, it is not enough to just hand people their order - a little customer service is essential. If you read these reviews, you haven't got anything special. 

The person who made the coffee handed it to the cashier who spilled it and handed it to me. I asked for a paper towel and the cashier directed me across the store to get one. So I said ""Let me get this straight, you made the mess and you want me to clean up after you?"" The cashier took the coffee back and (READ THIS) found a rag UNDER a counter-top machine and wiped the top of the coffee with it. 

When I had the melt-down the cashier defended his actions. He cleaned it, didn't he? The guy who spoke English came over and quickly took the coffee away from the cashier and made me another. 

If you don't care enough to speak the language (aka ""culture) or learn our sanitary laws, then I don't care to go into another Dunkin Donuts."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2011-11-14,2,"This location seems to always be consistently busy.  This shocks me due to the fact that the coffee is really not that good.  Their selection of pastries/donuts is typical of any Dunkin Donuts and the store is fairly clean and bright.  The Baskin Robbins side always seems a bit off.  I've had ice cream there once, and I don't know if my taste buds have matured, but it didn't seem that tasty.  Perhaps the ice cream was just old?  

Being that there are better options for both coffee and ice cream not too far away, I tend to avoid this place unless it's an emergency (read ""I'm out of coffee and there is 30 inches of snow on the ground)."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2011-07-28,5,"i love DD's! seriously... i am going to buy some of the stock as soon as it goes public. they have a deal right now, 99 cent iced tea, any size. I go at least 2-3 days on my way to work. I'm a big fan of their biscuits (great addition!) and I love the bagel twists. This location has a Baskin Robbins attached, which makes it the perfect place to grab a milkshake... love having a Dunkin so close to  my apartment, though it gets a little dangerous when I crave donuts every time I walk by."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2011-07-19,1,"More than any other food, I love doughnuts. All doughnuts are my friends, except the Boston Creme. Have eaten doughnuts at Dunkin, Krispy, Tim Horton's and independents. Must say my favorite by far is Krispy Kreme.
As far as  this DD location, wow, what a let down. The two doughnuts I purchased were nearly hard as rocks. That's how unfresh they were. And nearly two bucks for a soda bottle? Whew!!! But seriously, the doughnuts were disgusting. What's goign on here?"
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2010-11-06,4,"Yes, another place that we do not have here in SD. Another place I had to add to my list of eats. I see commercials for this place here on tv yet we do not have a Dunkin' Donuts. Doesn't that make you want it more!? Kind of like when they used to show the Sonics commercials before we actually had one out here.

 Honestly, there is nothing special about these donuts. All donuts taste the same to me. (well except Krispy Kremes)
The coffee is another story. Coffee is great here. So come for the coffee if you want a Starbucks alternative.

The donut holes are awesome too!

Here's a tip that worked for me:

Make a trip right when they are about to close. I walked by the shop with a sad look on my face as the guy was locking up. I guess he felt sorry so he let me in. (or he thought I was cute haha) I ordered a coffee and wanted some donut holes. I asked for a variety of ten. Next thing you know I'm walking outta there with ALL the donut holes. (guess he did think I was attractive. Lol )

Those donuts tasted so much better since they were free."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2010-10-08,2,"Dunkin' Donuts was at the top of my to-do list when I went to visit New York.

I quickly learned why they don't have Dunkin' Donuts over here on the west coast. Their donuts suck."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2010-07-28,4,"Enjoyed going here in the mornings!  The establishment is clean, the service was great and the coffee was spectacular.  I love how they put the cream and sugar in your cup  for you (to your liking).  I can't review much of anything else, because I only order the coffee, but the coffee is simply amazing.  I buy the coffee you can make at home, but there's just something about being able to walk out of your apartment and going to the corner Dunkin' Donuts and ordering a fresh, hot cup of joe."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2010-06-21,3,"My friends think you're quite special. However, I just commend you for your cleanliness and lovely newness of a building.

I've tried your donut hole donuts. They're not entirely fresh. And, I've bought a bottle of Dasani water- rip-off.

Plus, Dunkin' only gives 30 min of free wi-fi. 

Starbucks down the street is better with 2-hours free. . ."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2010-04-25,5,"This brings me back to my childhood.  The only thing I hate about Dunkin' Donuts is how they tease me with commercials yet the closest store to me is in another state.  Anyhow, I buy their coffee at Target and have my favorite vanilla frosted w/ sprinkles as my desktop wallpaper at work, because that's all I can really do to fill the empty void that is, Dunkin' Donuts =(

Okay enough sulking, I love their munchkins.  My favorite are the powdered white ones and the frosted chocolate ones.  As a breakfast person moreso than any other type of meal, donuts have become a staple in my life.  Krispy Kreme it is till I can go to Vegas again..."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2010-03-15,4,good service and much cleaner than most dunkin donuts locations. lines get long because of all the car dealerships and CBS located nearby but the lines move quickly. also has a baskin robbins inside but has limited flavor selections during winter months.
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2009-10-03,4,"I like the coffee, also the cappuccino...

I m not a donut-fan but would crave for one if i wanna something sweet & comforting.  This place is big and spacious, with high ceiling and WIFI but...

it lacks a conducive vibe for one to want to linger or seat in the cafe to enjoy the passer-by.  perhaps with a better seating, comfy couch, atmospheric lightings, it will be more inviting and less of a cold and boring place to be in.  

I am here only for the coffee."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2009-07-21,4,"I don't get why the East coast puts Dunkin up on a pedestal (vs Coffee Bean, Gloria Jean's, Seattle's Best - west siiiide) but this location's clean and convenient, so I'll take it. Also, half the store is Baskin Robbins with a full ice cream counter.

The service used to be horrible but maybe they've changed employees around because it's much better now. I even get jokes from some of them.

I come here because there's always a seat open, a flat screen tv broadcasting CNN, air conditioning on full blast, and FREE wi-fi (making it better than my living room). There's a sign on the front door advertising this, but if you try to access internet on your laptop/hand held, a screen pops up requiring you to pay. You have to go to the counter and request the ID and password. This can take a while because they have a long list and it changes every day and they never know which one it is, so you'll have to do some trial and error. 

People watching at the counter overlooking 10th Ave is amusing. I've seen a guy in boots and black hot shorts smaller than my underwear and nothing else walk by. Also watched someone try to park their car on the street for half an hour, Austin Powers style."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2008-07-20,1,"Since this branch is new, I was forgiving at first. However, after screwing up my order 4 times in a row...

My worst experience:

Who: 2 employees
What: 1 order of coffee.
Waiting time: 8 minutes
Number of customers at the same time and place: 1 (me)

When I got my order, it was dead wrong-- wrong flavor, wrong size, wrong temperature (I'm talking about hot or cold here). As expected, I complained. One of them looked at the other employee, conversed in a different language, turned to me and said, ""Just try that, you'll like it anyway."" I was completely pissed off but late for a meeting so I just took it.

Also, I was made fun of by one employee and the rest joined them. I've observed that they do this quite often with their customers and they do it in front of them. Really, really rude. 

I just go here because it's cheaper than Starbucks, but am always afraid of gambling my money and patience because of the employees."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2008-04-18,5,"Dunkin Donuts, you're special.  

Finding a Dunkin Donuts is like spotting a shooting star in a summer sky. Whether searching for hot chocolate in a blizzard or an iced coffee in 85 degree heat (it's not so much the heat as the humidity that gets you) their comforting goodness is there.

The Purple and pink colors, (signifying heaven on earth) are a beacon of hope. Once you see this color scheme, your bacon, egg and cheese sandwich is moments away.  Have you had one? If so, I don't need to explain the taste parade that ensues. 

If you haven't had one - good God, what are you waiting for?  

While their domination is evident in Connecticut and Boston, I've yet to feel overwhelmed by D&D deliciousness in Manhattan. Sure, they're here. But they're nowhere as prevalent as Starbucks. In Manhattan, I have to walk at least a few blocks (I'm out of breath by this point) and who has that kind of time? If I need to conduct this kind of search party to clog my arteries, it kind of defeats the point. 

To be clear, no one ""runs"" on Dunkin. 

It's more like a slow, satisfying crawl - culminating in a nap.

Dunkin Donuts, you're special."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2008-03-10,5,"I have a confession to make: I am a coffee snob.  I use a French press, I seek out new and interesting blends at coffee shops all over the city.  I know the difference between an Italian roast and a Viennese roast.  I know why Ethiopian beans taste different from Nigerian.  I own an espresso machine.

I have another confession to make: I love Dunkin' Donuts coffee.  Like LOVE it.  I crave it.  It's like crack (i also heard that it's like 3x more caffeinated than the average cuppa joe - this is complete hearsay, though, and not to be taken as fact).  Basically I blame my former roommate, a tried and true New Englander, who grew up with a D&D (or Dunks' as she likes to call it) on every corner.  We used to seek out the D&D's in the city whenever she had a craving.  She got me hooked.  It is my shame and my pleasure.

I now live approximately across the street from this particular franchise, so needless to say I start many a morning with a large iced coffee with half & half and two splendas.  If I really need a pick me up in the afternoon, I'll treat myself to a 2000 calorie (approx) Coolata, which is basically like frozen crack.  Everything else they serve is pretty much inedible, but damn, I love that coffee."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2008-01-16,3,"This particular Dunkin' Donuts is about as spare as it can be. Maybe there are 5 tables in there. Maybe there are about 10 chairs in there. The counter by the front window can only fit about 5 people, at the most. And most of all, there is no restroom. NONE! Which sucks for alot of people: those who want to wash their hands, those who simply have to use the bathroom, and for those who are standing for hours on end waiting for a taping of ""The Colbert Report"" just around the corner.

That being said, at least the hot chocolate was really good and very hot, which was perfect for me standing on line for 2.5 hours. And they have a new triple chocolate muffin, which was awesome. Not too hard,  and very moist and soft, and most of all chocolatey. 

If you do need to goto a restroom, I suggest the D'Agostino's  next door or the Barnes and Noble college bookstore up the block."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2006-08-02,4,"Auggh! How can the first reviewer for this establishment give it only 1 star?! What about all the childhood memories? Forgeddabout Dunkin' Donuts, yo! Baskin Robbins is where it's at. It's bicoastal and thriving!

I miss the days of the brown and pink uniforms. Sigh... You know that color scheme is sooooo coming back these days.

I love Baskin Robbins for their 2 quarts for $7 deal. Some places it's $8 but it's still worth it. Mint chocolate chip and chocolate peanut butter are my faves."
158,dunkin-new-york-76,2006-04-10,1,"Dunkin' Donuts has teamed up with Baskin Robbins to bring you donuts & ice-cream in the same place.  What can I say?  This place is convenient.  Get some Rocky Road and regular coffee.  Baskin Robbins has 24 flavors - not quite 31, but not too shabby either."
159,dunkin-new-york-49,2020-03-06,1,"I love doughnuts and when I heard Dunkin will give you a free doughnut today if you buy a drink and use there app, well I couldn't resist.   Plus it was my chance to also try their new Snackin Bacon too.
 
Well it all ended in 35 minutes of a waste of my time because using the app was slow and monotonous, Most likely to DD not being able to handle the amount of users using the app. 

I finally add all the items and the was being charged for the doughnut. I though maybe I get credit when I checked out but I got charge anyway. I explained at the store and they said wait for the manager and 10 minutes later he tells me to call the # on the app. After 15 minutes on hold, I finally get someone and all they could do was cancel the order and say to try using the app again ?
 
Well I am late for work , no doughnut or bacon and my Friday already sucks, thanks for nothing DD"
159,dunkin-new-york-49,2019-12-17,2,I was really hoping they would have rented out one of the larger spaces across the street that were available but I guess not. There is a space available for rent a few doors down though. This space is way too small for the amount of foot traffic this location gets. The location on 3rd Ave & 45th next to Wendy's is MUCH LARGER & MORE MANEUVERABLE. The food is always hit or miss but lately it's been mostly miss. They're gonna get someone sick with the way they heat stuff up (which is barely). I'm always having to use the microwave in the office to get sandwiches/wraps at a nice temperature. I got a blueberry muffin from there once that was pretty much mostly raw batter on the inside. How does that even happen? How is that even possible? I only go here b/c it's on the way to work. I've started using the mobile app for ordering & it makes a world of difference though.
159,dunkin-new-york-49,2019-07-18,5,Manager Masum was very helpful and super friendly... I can be a bit extensive with my questions about prices and very detailed about my orders at times... he was very patient and remained friendly and helpful which I really appreciated... food is always fresh here and the other staff were friendly as well... very comfortable shopping here... thank you Masum and staff!
159,dunkin-new-york-49,2019-02-14,1,I don't know how anyone has the patience to get coffee here during the morning rush..it's seriously claustrophobic and too slow.  The people that work there are nice but I don't have the patience to stand in a cattle car type setting just for a cup of coffee.  Also seems dirty.
159,dunkin-new-york-49,2016-10-26,1,"Gross!  My latte tasted like dirty dishes-that after taste from using a dirty sponge?  Took two sips and tossed it out. Also, they gave me the wrong donuts. I asked for jelly munchkins and got glazed..."

159,dunkin-new-york-49,2016-08-10,2,"Paying $2.06 for a small coffee is tough but it is NYC.  The cashier here is friendly and has a pleasant smile.  The guy who prepares and serves you the coffee is nice too, but he should not put his hands on the lid since your mouth could end up there.  Proper technique is crucial."
159,dunkin-new-york-49,2015-12-22,1,"Went to this Dunkin at 10pm, walked out of my way because it was open until 11 and it was NOT open. Employees inside but lights off, no sign no nothing. Seriously?"
159,dunkin-new-york-49,2015-12-01,4,"There are no Dunkin' Donuts near me, so I had to go before we caught a plane! 

Dunkin' is a good place to go for a plane cup of coffee. I got a dark roast large and was happy with that. I didn't see any Macchiatos or Lattes advertised as options, even though their website shows that it is an option. 

We got a couple of donut holes and a Sweet Black Pepper Bacon sandwich which was too greasy to finish. 

They get a 4 and not a 5 bc the place needed some cleaning and the sandwich was not that great. 

The service was quick and to the point."
159,dunkin-new-york-49,2015-05-19,4,"This is a newly opened Dunkin' Donuts it's pretty much the exact same as every other Dunkin' Donuts meaning they have all of the coffee and tea items that you would expect on the menu. 

The one thing that I did like about this Dunkin' Donuts is it is very modern inside the entire store is in a glass building the server was nice she looked really board. she was just looking out the window. I ended up getting a hot tea for the train ride back upstate. The store is nothing special but I do like Dunkin' Donuts over Starbucks for hot tea any day this is a good Dunkin' Donuts to come to to grab a hot tea to take back upstate with you.  I would rather walk the two blocks to come to this Dunkin' Donuts then to go to the Starbucks in Grand Central any day. There also is a really good deli across the street that you can get good food and salads and they do have one of the biggest fruit bars I've seen in a long time."
159,dunkin-new-york-49,2015-04-08,2,"I usually only go to Dunkin because of their iced coffee's in the spring/summer time.  They know how to do those right.  I recently went there to pick up a couple of latte's, an americano, and a iced coffee.  As I'm sure most people know that Dunkin' is no place for latte's and americanos, but my boss wanted an iced coffee from there and I didn't feel like going to two separate places. I put in my order and I received an iced coffee, one latte, and two regular coffees.  I spoke to the lady after and explained, I asked for two latte's, I didn't even pick a fight about the americano, because i'm not sure they even know what that is anymore.  Anyway, this Dunkin Donuts, just confirmed that I should never be ordering any type of espresso drinks again.  They're good for iced coffee's and that's about it in my opinion."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2020-03-14,1,"Total ahitbox deli.  If you're used to local deli/ bodegas I. nY, avoid this one.  Puny sandwiches with no meat and they charge extra for toppings. They tried to charge me $1.50 for peppers and my sandwich had like four slices of meat.  Total rip off, don't know how these assholes are still open."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2020-02-14,1,Get it together!! The Friday morning breakfast crew were well meaning but disorganized and didn't really listen. They got my sandwich order wrong but it took so long to get it that I just paid for what they gave me and left. Also they microwave their bacon?!
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2019-10-17,1,Never going back. They can't get simple sandwich order correct. Ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich w lettuce and bacon. They have me a sandwich w chicken so tough and old it had begun to turn black and as well putting about 3 spoonfuls of mayo on it. Not the first time they have ruined my day but it will be the last. If ur considering getting food here I suggest u dont .
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2019-10-13,3,They gave me the wrong sandwich. I asked for a chicken cutlet with cheese bacon and LT. charged me for bacon and there was none on the sandwich. You have one job...take an order and make sure it's correct! Rather go to Alan's two blocks away
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2019-08-31,5,"We are staying at The Empire Hotel right about 700 ft from Melissa's and I was delighted to walk by it one day thinking ""hopefully I will see a deli I can grab a sandwich in"". Ta-daaa!!! Good selection of pre-prepared grab and go sandwiches, salads, fruit selections, etc. Great for stocking the mini fridge at the hotel and beats the price of grabbing (even if quick) a sit down restaurant lunch. Extraordinarily nice and efficient staff. Nice snack, beer and nonalcoholic beverage selection (and yes they have White Claw). Small selection of international delicacy items. Had to grab an almond horn/pastry which is not as rich in almond paste as others I've had but certainly fresh and delightful. I had to make room for a couple of bites after eating only half of my giant lox bagel! HUGE menu, I'm probably going to have to go back a few more times. ;)"
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2019-07-03,5,Super great deli right near Lincoln Center.  Very good sandwiches at a reasonable cost.
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2019-04-07,3,"I walked past this place because I needed something on the go to eat in the park and got a salad. The guys dropped a full bottle of oil in it. Unacceptable. And the salad was blunt, no salt"
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2019-03-15,1,"I come here often not expecting much. Often my orders are incorrect  so try to not order with a certain someone. This time I asked for two ham cheese toasted with mayo hero sandwiches to the young white man with curly hair.   

I went to my car in front of the store to eat and realized I got served two hero's with only ham, not toasted and they cheaped on their lettuce, gave me literally just once peace of a leaf on one of the sandwiches.    

I went back to ask them to put the cheese and the guy argues with me that I didn't ask for cheese.  

After I walked out I was frustrated because I saw the ladies that sell food to the construction workers (which is a much better meal and value)"
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2019-03-02,1,I would give zero stars if I could. They are RUDE and the FOOD IS GROSS. I've given them a few chances and each time it gets more disappointing.  This was the last time I'll be back. If you're going to be rude at least have a good product.
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2018-12-15,5,"Excellent food! Deli with hot food! Melissa's Gourmet makes pastries, sandwiches, and more. I loved the curry chicken salad. Now that I am a vegetarian, I get the fruit and pastries. I had an eggplant wrap today. It was great! If you're around Broadway and 62nd Street in Manhattan, go in. You'll be happy!"
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2018-10-10,4,"I rolled in there at midnight, after arriving on a late flight. They were about the only restaurant open in the area of my hotel. Nice ladies at the front. Good deli food. Plus a good selection of market foods."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2018-09-06,1,Ordered an everything bagel toasted with vegetable cream cheese.  The cream cheese was rancid.  Would have returned it but was already at my office and was too far to walk back.  Thanks Melissa's Gourmet.
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2018-04-17,4,"I come here often for lunch because it's mainly the only deli around. For $6 the salads are great! I've never had any issues with this place at all. Breakfast isn't too bad either but I prefer the small food trucks for that. My only complaint is how rude the young lady working register is, I've gone and she has answered her cellphone right in front of me while I'm trying to pay."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2018-02-16,2,"I have tried their cold sandwich with ham, Swiss cheese, lettuce, and tomato with mayonnaise on a roll.   I have also tried their bagels with cream cheese and hot coffee. I would pass on the cold sandwich and their coffee.

The prices are okay for the area, but not great for what you get.

They do offer like a 10% discount to students with ID, but I believe you have to spend like $10."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2018-01-20,4,"Been here a couple times now. Prices are cheap for the area though sure, a little pricier than your average deli. $1.50 for a bagel w/butter - perfectly toasted, good amount of butter (not too much or too little), both the bagel and butter were fresh and delicious. Salad greens and veggies were fresh too. Haven't tried any of their sammies yet but plan to as they've got an extensive menu and everything else has been great so far!

(Service was fine - fast and polite)"
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2017-12-16,2,"...this place charges you an extra dollar for a bacon and egg on a roll after 12pm! when asked why the increase i was told ""because we have to bring out a different grill."" idiots. there are better places around the corner."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2017-09-21,1,"In all honesty, I don't care about the price. It's Manhattan, and I expect prices to be higher than in other places (I live in Queens). The food isn't even half-bad.

But the problem I have is how often they mess up my order most mornings. I order a bacon, egg, and cheese with salt, pepper, and ketchup when I get breakfast from here. The majority of the time,they'll miss something (forgetting to put either one of the salt, pepper, or ketchup, or just not put any of it at all). I've had to resort to double checking when I get it, and asking them if they do. And they STILL. SCREW. UP.

Long story short, if there was another place in the area I could go for breakfast sandwiches, I would. But I don't know any, so I'll just bite the bullet for now."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2017-01-04,1,"I stopped by this place after a late movie -- it looked like the safest and nicest place around still open. Wow was that wrong! 

I chose a pre-made sandwich from the refrigerator case with a price sticker of $2.95. When I got to the counter the check-out woman said it had been mislabeled and really cost $7.95. 

I suggested that if a store puts a certain price on something, they should sell it for that price -- and they turned dark. They were all just standing around and I asked if I could speak to the manager and she pointed out a man nearby and he refused to tell me his name and was hostile.

It was 100℅ obvious that they had made this mistake, the tag was professionally affixed and there wasn't a remote possibility otherwise, but the manager peeled it off, spending awhile rubbing off the gummy bits, then accused me of wanting to rob their store and said he would call the police.

I said I wanted to complain formally, that this was a pretty serious accusation he was making. I felt the tone become menacing. Then the woman behind the counter changed what she'd said and now said this man wasn't the manager -- he was wearing a store uniform -- and that I couldn't speak to one. I had no idea what was going on.

The manager / not manager said to me something like, ""What is it you want? To save a couple of dollars? Can we give you a free sandwich?""

Glad he had woken up and realized they were in the service industry and wanted to behave like an actual shop employee I said yes -- happy to resolve the situation in a friendly manner. But he was just taunting me. ""We don't give free food here,"" he said snidely. One or two of the others took up this phrase after him, like a humiliation.

I again said I wanted to complain, and the woman behind the counter told me that no, I don't. Another store employee got on his mobile phone and I felt like they might become violent with me. I turned to leave -- but not before snapping a photo of the manager / not manager for protection, in case they were going to come after me. I suggested to him that if they treat their customers better they wouldn't have such problems. He glared at me menacingly, I fled, got in the nearest cab and got far away from Columbus Circle.

It wasn't the mislabeling which motivates me to write this review now -- mistakes can happen -- nor the fact that they wouldn't resolve it in my favor. It was the way they dealt with it, acted and treated a customer which is so chilling.

I've never remotely had such an experience in a NYC shop before. Personally I feel like this shop needs to close. Anyway their policy seems to be, enter at your own risk. Good luck with that."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2016-10-25,4,Good breakfast sandwiches. I don't really come in here for lunch. Staff is nice and efficient. Good selection of snacks at the front counter. I wish they would lower the credit card minimum. It is currently $10 which is annoying for regulars like me who just want an egg Sammie and a coffee.
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2016-08-25,4,"I love this place to grab a quick salad or deli food for lunch! Service is always friendly and fast, and there are SO MANY options, I usually have to decide what I want before I get there, otherwise I will stand there forever looking at everything and trying to decide. Great stop for picking up a quick snack, coffee or soft drink too. The place is tiny, but they really have pretty much everything to eat/drink and the line always moves quickly."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2016-04-26,3,"i am not a regular but i do come here once or twice a week just for their chicken salad on a roll. their chicken salad is pretty tasty. coffee is ok. got their salad once and had a stomach ache afterwards. so yea, this place can be a hit or a miss."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2016-01-09,4,"I definitely don't understand all of the negative reviews. Stopped in for a salad last night after a concert at Lincoln Center. Found the service to be courteous and prompt. The options for toppings on the salad were more than adequate, and for the price, it was fantastic. I will definitely be back, when I'm in the neighborhood!"
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2015-11-12,2,Lots of choices and speedy service but they will short you on weight. Disappointing discovery after years  of  going there.  Just out of principle i  will not go back.  Fortunately compelled me to try Alans Market around corner and found up  20% savings and honest pricing. Very much worth the short walk.
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2015-09-30,2,"Tried this place a few times and each time I've vowed to never come back. Staff is inattentive behind the counter. Had to try pretty hard to get my bacon, egg and cheese order in. The sandwich itself is just terrible too. They're lucky to be the only option in the area."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2015-08-11,1,"This place nickel-and-dimes you at every turn.  For one, there's a $1 upcharge to have your sandwich on a wrap.  This I can understand, though--it probably takes a little more meat, etc. to fill up a wrap as opposed to bread slices.  But recently I asked them to add lettuce, tomato, and onion to one of their sandwiches that didn't come with either, and they told me that it would cost seventy five cents extra for EACH add-on!  Today, I asked them to add hot peppers, and they tried to charge me seventy five cents extra for these--without telling me about the added cost until it was my turn to pay. (Note: I've been getting hot peppers added for weeks, and this is the first time they charged me more). 

This practice is ridiculous.  Lettuce, tomatoes, hot peppers, onions, whatever--these are standard toppings for any sandwich at any deli.  It shouldn't cost me three dollars extra to enjoy the basics.  

Never again.  Too bad, because the sandwiches are tasty otherwise."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2015-06-16,4,"Just got lunch for the family.  Not from around here, so we needed a little help with the menu.  A gentleman from behind the counter help us get our ""New York sandwiches. "" He even took the time to run down the street after I forgot a sandwich!   Way to represent NYC.  PS. sandwiches were great!"
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2014-09-01,1,"I went to get an Italian sandwich on a hero with onions, lettuce & oil and vinegar. I got back to my desk and it was on a small roll with tomatoes and peppers. It had no onions and it was all lettuce with like a slice of cheese, ham and salami. Never again."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2014-07-26,1,"Do you like nice, homestyle breakfast platters? With fresh muffins, English toast and all the warmhearted commodities of home? If you do then you do not want to go here. Melissa's gourmet deli is only 66% right. It should just be called Melissa's deli because obviously the gourmet has left the building. This is a below average multi selection style deli and breakfast place on Broadway only two blocks from Lincoln Center. And because it's the only deli in an eight Block radius, this place should be packed at all times. But on a good day you may only see about eight or 10 patrons in there. That should have been my first hint that this place was going to disappoint right off the bat. And the patrons inside are Probably all locals who are just getting the safe bet. The buttered roll, and coffee.
Well I was tired of walking, and between the stomach rumblings and sweat beating down the small of my back, decided that their subpar air-conditioning and half assed service with just have to do.
The menu, posted on the wall with hand written items as well as chalk written specials marred the entire ceiling. It was totally confusing so as opposed to trying to figure out what half of the aforementioned items were, ( I did not have a CIA code breaker at the time ) I decided to go with one of the breakfast or lunch Staples. I chose a BLT. Now I'm sure all of you out there reading this, have often wondered the answer to the age old question ""who could possibly screw up a BLT? "" well my friends, it's your lucky day because I have the answer. Melissa's gourmet deli can.
Dried whole wheat toast smeared with a microscopic layer of tasteless mayonnaise, layered with rockhard Romain leaves a couple of pieces of Unripe chunky beefsteak tomato and to top it all off some delicious succulent microwaved bacon. I mean if this bacon were living in Japan in the 1940s, it might as well have been called the Hiroshima BLT. Because the inexperienced and uncaring fry cooks managed to nuke the shit out of this pork. To the point where I was looking for a piece of cardboard to put on the sandwich for some moisture.
Although the cashier and staff were attractive and very nice people, the food that they offer leaves nothing to be desired. They've got a gold mine at their feet because of their location yet refuse to kick it up a notch and put a Little love and extra time into their food. If the owner of the deli ever steps outside, I suggest that he or she find out what bus the ""gourmet ""left on and chase them down and bring them back. Because right now in my opinion, Melissa's gourmet deli is only the equivalent to those little vending machines that you would find next to the animal pens at the zoo. The ones that you put a quarter in to get the dry nuggets out and feed the goats. But if You are into that kind of thing, purchase an item and after your first taste and immediate disgust, there is a cool homeless guy with a little pitbull named Nitro that is usually outside on the sidewalk. And he and his pup would always appreciate a free meal."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2014-06-19,1,"Blergh. The veggies at the salad bar looked like they'd been sitting out forever - peas discolored, corn looked shriveled - and I should have listened to my instinct and walked out. 

Instead I got a salad, with a hard-boiled egg as my protein, and when I opened the container I saw that the yolk was all grey like a really old egg. Then I took one bite, and there was an overall sour taste, like all the ingredients had turned a little. Into the trash, and never going there for lunch again."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2014-04-28,1,"I went here one day and got a turkey, american cheese, lettuce and mayo on a roll.; when i got back to my desk and opened the sandwich i was disgusted. Their was like 2 slice of turkey and one slice of cheese but plenty of lettuce. WTF!!?? To make it worse, it was over $7. 

A word to the owner 1. read the reviews on here 2. tell your staff to be more polite to their customers

I have been in the deli business for over 15 years, I have worked for some big name companies. I know what it cost to make a sandwich. You cannot be serving sandwiches that small with that price. Terrble.

Never coming back here again."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2013-11-23,5,"I honestly and genuine have no complaints and am very happy with the food and service. I work on 68th st, and have lunch delivered and it is always delivered in a timely matter and made fresh. My go-to is a chicken Caesar wrap, and it is absolutely delicious. I definitely recommend this place!"
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2013-11-05,1,"Warning: DO NOT use your credit card at Melissa's, several people have had fraudulent charges after using their cards."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2013-08-30,1,"I ordered an english muffin with peanut butter...which was $4. Alright, I get it, we're in NYC. But, when the guy handed my order to the cashier saying ""english muffin with butter"". She tells him that's wrong and he went to make me another one. Surprisingly it was done in more than half the time that I was waiting there for the first one. So, I asked if he just put peanut butter on it on top of the butter. The cashier assured me he didn't. Well, I should have trusted my instinct and checked it because he did. $4 english muffin with butter & peanut butter. Awesome. Never going back."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2013-06-06,3,"I'm not sure how this place is getting so many negative reviews considering how utterly expensive and mediocre food is in the upper west side (it really has the most bland food in the city at a high price point).    That said i'm only here for lunch when the food is fresh so maybe that accounts for the difference.

The lunch specials/hot meals are good when they are freshly cooked.  I just had jambalaya and jerk chicken and both were exploding with flavor.  It's not the best i ever had, but it's certainly better than the corporate cafeteria.   When you add to the fact $8.50 is not gonna get you anything in this neighborhood it makes it's pretty economical to eat here.  If you are expecting quality i don't even know where you go in this neighborhood for that.  I haven't had a good sandwich anywhere in Lincoln Square/UWS.  If you are trying to save for a vacation or spare drinking money this is where you go to."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2013-02-19,1,"Don't order any hot sandwiches. Don't order any sandwiches at all for that matter. I found string in my Philly cheese steak last night and I've been on the toilet ever since. Even if there weren't random non edible objects in the sandwich it was still poorly made and tasted like card board. Go to the sandwich shop across the street. You'll thank me later.

Oh did I mention the 2 slices of cheese and 2 slices of roast beef cost me $12.00!!! Rip off."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2013-02-05,1,"Fml, I just got ripped off. I bought a turkey sandwich for 8 bucks from this place and there was literally about 2 slices of turkey in my sandwich...how cheap!"
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2012-09-30,5,"We stopped by while visiting NYC from Florida, best BLT i ever had. pile high with bacon. My sister and friend enjoyed thier sandwich just as much. I only came to give feedback because im craving one now."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2011-12-14,1,they will rip you off in a heartbeat. 12 dollars for a pound of turkey and 9 for a pound of cheese. better off getting deli products at another market. super pissed they didn't advertise the price. never will I walk in here again.
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2011-05-06,1,"this place is disgusting 
the food is horrible and overpriced, not fresh,  
 if ur visiting NYC n cAme on a late flight its near by ur hotel and everything else is closed, trust me go to sleep. if u eat here ur memories of ny wont be good, plus if its that late u shudnt be eating anything anyways unless its worth it which this place isint 
id suggest greys papayas over this place,,"
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2011-04-27,5,"I'm giving Melissa's ""Gourmet"" five stars because a) I only go there to get a quick snack (fruit, nuts, etc) and there's hardly ever a line [woohoo], b) the people at the counter never make me feel weird about the fact that I'm there nearly every single day (buying the same thing), which I'm very grateful for. There's nothing more embarrassing than going to the same place every day and having the cashiers make comments about it in front of all the other customers. So if you just want a good snack, quick service, and total anonymity, then go to Melissa's."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2011-03-18,2,"OK so basically I have the same feelings as this guy :
""""""I do not recommend Melissa's Gourmet, neither as a grocery store nor as an eatery -- with Whole Foods and Morton Williams and 'wichcraft nearby, there's really no reason to come here... Everything is over-priced, they're not very generous with their sandwiches or soups or salads (portions are small and they charge for absolutely each and every little special request -- $0.75 for a piece of lettuce? $0.75 for a slice of tomato?), and the people at the cash registers are really slow oftentimes very rude.""""""
But less strongly since I was STARVING after work and a movie at the Lincoln Center Plaza Cineama and had my mind set on Turkey and brie = it was a big disappointment but I ate it all the same -- too much not very special bread and I wanted roasted turkey----I saw some guy walking a bway eatying some baguette sammie and MAJOR  lunch envy because HE had what I wanted---but I couldnt stop him ===his mouth was full. Anyway - over priced for what I got, and there are better things in the area.......I have to find that origin of that good looking sammiche. 
can use CC - 
yeah I got no lettuce or tomat but according to this guy they charge extra - lame! it's a sammie! 

also maybe they have good bagels?? - but a deli equals sanwiches in my head."

Our flight arrived at 11 p.m. so we hit up Melissa's at midnight because it was right around the corner from our hotel. We got warm mashed potatoes and grilled chicken practically every day for our son who has gluten allergies. The guys behind the counter were super sweet. 
We got the best deli sandwiches, chips, snacks and beer which was much cheaper than the prices at our hotel mini bar!! Everyone was super sweet. It was our GO-TO place and saved us tons o' dough!!"
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2010-07-23,2,"Just OK. A friend and I found ourselves on the southwest corner of Central Park and decided to grab a sandwich for a picnic. I had a roastbeef sandwich and a side of curry chicken salad. The sandwich was cool.. nothing particularly special. Although, if I was forced to note something I would mention that the bread was pretty soft. The chicken curry salad on the other hand was dreadful. Unhealthy neon yellow and just gross.. no thank you. Overall the food is decent but there are too many great eateries in NY to insult your stomach with this one."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2010-04-13,4,They have some great sandwiches. Try one.  Greta to pick up something before heading to the park.

If you are looking to save the most money you're of course better off with a street vendor but you'll be sacrificing quality."
160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2008-11-22,2,"$15 for a six pack of Bud Light, $3 for Vitamin Water, $2 for a soda... get my drift?

Most the food looks like it's been setting out for hours.

Coffee sucks too.

They do have good bagels and breakfast sandwiches though."

160,melissas-gourmet-new-york,2007-08-02,2,"After walking up and down Manhattan trying not to get lost, I ended up being hungry.  I did not want to get food at Central Park, so I kept walking down West 62nd Street.  Finally, I decided to stop at the first decent deli place I saw... Melissa's Gourmet Deli.  

Small, but filled with random snacks and beverages.  There's a whole list of different kinds of sandwich meats, cheeses and entrees.  I went for the beef stew and rice.  Good portion, tender beef, tasty veggies and mouthwatering sauce.  The rice was just okay... I was a bit disappointed because I how can anybody screw up cooking rice?  I didn't understand, it was hard and watery at the same time... 

I probably won't go back, but if I'm every in the neighborhood and craving for some good beef stew, I just might stop by :-)!"

161,starbucks-new-york-561,2019-03-14,2,"I brought my dog in here. He didn't like it. He started to Snarlbucks.

There seem to be about 1,500 Starbucks in Manhattan and I don't really like any of them but they can often be the best place to use the bathroom. I just don't like lattes here and I don't like the coffee here - it's gross even though it's quite New York in some ways. But I used the bathroom at this Starbucks on a couple of occasions and I appreciate them for that."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2018-09-26,1,"Horrible customer service. As I walked up to order, Jon, was facedown in his phone. He apparently said something to me, but I had no clue he was even talking to me bc he didn't look up. After ordering, he went right back into his phone. 4 of the employees were in their phones while working."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2017-09-07,4,"All hail Starbucks for having a bathroom. I walked from Penn to Central Park on Labor Day and was pretty beat after and needed a pick me up... and a bathroom. Luckily, I found one of the million Sbucks in the city and got myself a small coffee to keep me company while I waited a half hour for the bathroom. The staff were really, really friendly."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2017-06-19,1,"Terribly rude staff. Waited over 15 minutes for an iced tea and when I asked when my drink was coming up the barista basically ignored me and continued making drinks that were ordered well after mine. She actually said to the other barista ""are you helping her because she keeps looking at me"".  Excellent customer service Starbucks. Will stick to my specialty coffee houses where people care about their job and their coffee. Pathetic."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2017-06-01,1,"Absolutely the worst run Starbucks in the chain. The rudest staff.  Not all of them. But, many are shockingly rude for a Starbucks.  The store is totally cluttered and cramp and always dirty.  Can't believe it's allowed to continue operating."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2016-12-09,1,"As a woman, if I could give this bathroom zero stars, I would. Why require a drink purchase if the BR is filthy! I frequent Starbucks daily and appreciate a clean lavatory. The cappuccino is perfect and received 5 stars. Starbucks, Please work towards a 5 on bathrooms."

Oh, got served cold green tea latte then asked to recreate new one with hotter version. Now 2nd latte is not sweetened. Not good service to pay attention with my online order. Please pay attention next time."

* restroom with code. That makes it a little cleaner

*long communal table for large groups or making friends 

*smaller tables for couples or singles

*convenient location

*good customer service 


Overall, I recommend."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2016-09-08,1,Wow. Have to agree. This location is horrible. So slow. Bad service. Waited over ten minutes with only three people in front of me. Go somewhere else.
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2016-09-02,1,"I've spent so much time in Starbucks around the world. This is the worst one I've ever been too. The coffee they make isn't consistent with the other Starbucks as they shouldn't be. On a few different days the coffee machines kept breaking down. The lines were always long and backed up at this location, sometimes waiting up to 10 minutes or more for everyone's order.  People complaining on the few occasions about the service.  The others in the area that are better, but not by much and I have no idea why."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2016-08-23,4,Considering the location if you don't time it right you're in for a wait..staff is friendly and professional....considering the crowds and time I would recommend using your order feature on the app to order complex orders i.e. the frappicino as I did..
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2016-08-13,1,I asked them nicely to turn the music down. It sounds like a night club in here- hurting my ears literally. I Don't know how anyone in here is dealing. So one employee turns it down to a normal level and another goes over a second later and blasts it again. SO unprofessional. You're here to make coffee and help create a welcoming atmosphere- not play club DJ. I recommend going a block down and visiting the other Starbucks if you have the choice. Unless you feel like twerking in a fast food place....
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2016-03-22,5,"Had breakfast here today. Good quality, good taste. Friendly and helpful staff!! Try the orange juice. Taste delicious."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2015-12-13,3,"One of the few Starbucks in the area (and there are many) with both a bathroom and a halfway decent amount of outlets. My barista was being trained so she messed up my drink (passion tea lemonade without the lemonade) but I did notice her trainer Chanel was instructing her to make sure her drinks went out in order, which is a nice touch - i see a lot of reviews complaining about drink order at Sbux. 

It's shocking how many Sbux don't have bathrooms now as someone who has to work in cafes and will gladly buy multiple drinks as long as theres a bathroom."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2015-08-21,2,"The cashier was extremely rude. I ordered an iced doppio with 1 pump vanilla and a splash of 2% She kept trying to correct me, telling me that's not what it's called...it's called a double shot. It clearly said on the screen that it's a doppio....I said no and repeated my order. She then repeated herself and tried to correct me and kept asking me ""did you hear me? It's called a double shot"" I told her my order again and told her it's cheaper and she tried to prove me wrong. 4 stars for my drink (requested light caramel drizzle, but our opinions for light are different). 1 star for horrible service."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2015-08-16,1,Worst Starbucks I've encountered in NYC. I ordered 2 iced coffees- simple- right. It's taking 15 minutes to get 2 iced coffees. It's really not that hard people ...
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2015-08-13,4,"Was taken care of by a server, I think Wendy.  She prepared my drink exactly as ordered. Medium busy with place to sit, read, text relax. Nice music in the background. Overall a pleasant Starbucks experience. Would recommend this location to my friends! A little hard to enter as they are doing construction to the building next door which is not there fault."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2015-06-21,1,Dirtiest Starbucks we have ever been in. I couldn't believe the trash all over the floors and counters. Plus we waited 5 minutes for someone to take our order and they weren't making other orders. The guy finally walked up to the counter and stared at us with annoyance.
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2015-06-19,5,"They are so nice and great service...!! Busy Starbucks shop, a lot of people...! Nothing so said... Everything is perfect for me... Also I like this Starbucks... It's big... :) 
And clean... :)"
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2015-02-28,3,"E-Scale: 6/10

I came here just to have some afternoon coffee on a Saturday afternoon. I was pleasantly surprised at how NOT crowded it was. Even the line for the bathroom was short and quick. Coffee was your typical Starbucks coffee, nothing bad but nothing to write home about either.

The reason I gave it 3 stars is because there isn't a lot of places to sit here, and no couches either. I ended up sitting at the communal table in the front. For being in midtown, it was fairly quiet and peaceful. More seats would have been nice and I would have stayed longer (and been more comfortable).

Overall, one of the nicer Starbucks in the city. I'll definitely keep it in mind next time I'm shopping and need a break!"
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2014-11-05,4,"Good location, again, and it's trusty Starbucks so you already know what to expect.

Go here and grab something (coffee, water, juice, snacks)...or use the restroom before heading into Central Park, just in case."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2014-07-27,1,"Agree with Stephen. Very dirty in here. They need to put their act together. I'm not a big coffee drinker of a man, but I love chai latte. Here I didn't order anything. In and out in the same minute."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2013-10-08,1,"This is for the icky bakery items in all the stores. Dry, tasteless, yuck. No pumpkin scones, no pay my iced pound cake just sucks. I didn't like boulongerie when I lived in sf and don't want it in my Starbucks"
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2013-05-16,3,"Not the best Starbucks i've ever been to, sometimes the workers think they are Lords and Ladies, and can't be bothered.

You'll give you Starbucks... and then leave."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2013-02-05,3,"This location is tucked under a large office building on 6th Avenue and is not that far from another Starbucks just a few blocks away.  I went in with the intent of purchasing a pound of whole bean coffee and was disappointed with the selection.  Clearly this store caters to the office employee who is not interested in buying beans.  With that said, I ended up getting their only ""special"" edition bean they had (turned out to be great!) and quickly paid for my item using their cool new App on the iPhone.  The staff was extremely friendly so that salvaged the third star.  A-OK"
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2013-01-10,4,"Good coffee.  The system for getting your coffee/lattes/sandwiches is a little confusing, but you will get your food."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2011-09-27,4,"It is Starbucks...

So with that being said this one is one that I typically find myself stopping at before hitting the J O B.  It is a crap shoot with regards to how busy it is in here.  Given it's proximity to Central Park and the Midtown hotels it is safe to say that you will find tourists in here trying to figure out what to order.

The employees are pretty good at recognizing there ""regular"" guests so if you are so lucky you can be in and out within a quick New York Minute if not and you have a line of European kids in front of you figuring out what flavor of blended drink they will be ordering.  If the later is the case expect to be there for a bit...

Underground Business: A single towards the back; that given said tourist can make waiting a little tiresome."
161,starbucks-new-york-561,2011-03-16,2,"Seriously, WTF? The employees were so slow and inattentive it was unreal. I will never return, especially after looking at my watch and seeing I waited about 10 minutes and there were only 3 total people waiting for drinks. If they stopped bullshitting with each other and made the F-ing drink I would have been gone 8 minutes earlier."

Upon entering this Starbucks, which sits opposite of Jekyll and Hyde, the renowned New York haunted restaurant and bar, I was very disappointed to not see my favorite Polar Bear holiday sugar cookie in plain sight.  However, to my surprise when voicing upon request, the Starbucks staff with great pleasure freshly served me a Polar Bear holiday sugar cookie.

Bears always bring comfort in my darkest times!"
162,healthy-market-new-york,2020-03-24,2,"I work in the area. The Cook there is Great, he does your order just as requested.  I have to say that Management SUCKS.  The charge extra for everything.  I ordered a bacon Cheeseburger with fried onions and provolone cheese with french fries. . You get a free can soda if you pick up your order instead of having it delivered.  They charged me $.50 for the provolone cheese, fried onions and you no longer get a free can soda. This order is a total of $11.89. 

From here on out I'll walk 3extra blocks to Five Guy's"
162,healthy-market-new-york,2019-08-18,2,"Again, this is a fine neighborhood bodega. Prices are high but they're what you pay in Manhattan. That said, I found out they are charging an extra 4% to use your credit card. That's too high, ruins the whole experience."
162,healthy-market-new-york,2019-07-06,5,"Good food. The panini was yummy and their smoothie is to die for. (Or maybe I was just hangry. Lol) They have really nice staff. And the grandson of the owner was a hottie, which was icing on the cake."
162,healthy-market-new-york,2019-05-23,2,"Ordered the I Love Veggie wrap and a Falafel wrap. I asked for an extra side of Low fat tahini for the falafel wrap. I ended up with a I Love Veggie wrap with no hummus on it, and a Falafel wrap with no tahini on it. A side of hummus, but no side of tahini.

The veggie wrap was good, but the Falafel was trash. Water has more flavor!The Falafel just broke apart, Cookie Monster would be proud. How do you ruin Falafel?"

They also have a tiny sign saying they charge 4% for credit cards. Even if you hand them a debit card, they'll process it as a credit card without telling you. They're awful people!"
162,healthy-market-new-york,2018-01-21,5,Great panini's!! It's like 6.50 for a big panini and chips. 10/10 would recommend for cheap but great food. Also full menu 24/7 and free delivery

I ordered on seamless and asked for something not in the wrap, they read the comment in the order and made it correctly. Everything in it tasted fresh and Good. Sometimes at markets or delis wraps are not so great but this one was so good I will definitely order from here again"
162,healthy-market-new-york,2017-04-28,1,Made an order while I was desperately hungry....they made me wait 40 minutes before randomly canceling my order. The least they could have done was inform me immediately they didn't want to take my order before canceling and making me waste my time.
162,healthy-market-new-york,2016-07-12,5,They renovated the place and hired a new cashier she is awesome really good costumer service  and the food is great even tho I miss the hot food

However, on my way there, one of the employees came running to tell me they'll take my order anyways without having me pay for it to their location. I'd say that that's close to the best customer service I've seen. Will definitely return!"

amazing iced coffee tho"

163,dunkin-new-york-102,2019-06-21,1,People working there were extremely unfriendly. The person who made our shakes didn't know what he was doing and filled the first cup up 3/4 of the way. The shake was predominantly milk and no words were exchanged at the cash register. It's best to stay clear of this location.
163,dunkin-new-york-102,2017-02-14,1,"Stole my money. 

I have 2 or 3 gift cards on my DD app. Today I went in, ordered a coffee, and was going to pay with a couple of the cards to clear out the balances. The first gift card they scanned had $.63 on it. They scanned it and my gift card went to $0 and then they proceeded to tell me that there was no money on the gift card and I still owed the full price of the coffee. Even after I showed them the activity on the app, they refused to help. I get that it's only $.63, but if your machine is taking people's money and you refuse to help, why would I allow you to scan another gift card and why would I come back?

I come here 3-4 times per week for my coffee. No more."
163,dunkin-new-york-102,2015-04-23,4,"a small double d that is a decent place to get something quick. its typical dd decor with donuts, bagels and breakfast and lunch options display on big screen, with a few tables and chairs to sit and enjoy your donuts and coffee. the free wifi is fast cause i was only one inside besides the two workers, who happen to be two cheerful chaps. i really enjoy when the donut racks are filled to the max. i got a large mocha ice coffee which was made just right, and i get a kick out of the peeps on top of the donuts( i had two and soon i will start my diet). the place is kept clean and the condiment counter was stocked nicely. i was able to get 6 donuts for the road and the gentleman added one on the house, good customer service. its sometimes the little things, like good morning and how is your ice coffee that is a big deal to me, i will be back when i am in the area.

(Both registers occupied, so staffer from the back takes my order)

""I'll have a medium french vanilla with milk and sugar please.""
(He makes coffee correctly and brings it to me)
""I just need to pay for this,"" I say to the cashier. No response. I assume she didn't hear me. She keeps taking and fulfilling orders as I stand like a doofus off to the side.
""Might as well go to the back of the line,"" I say to myself. A few minutes later, I'm at the register.
""I just need to pay for this,"" I say. 
""I'm sorry sir, we'll fix it right away,"" the cashier replies and hands the coffee off to a staffer who walks away with it.
""No wait, it's fine!"" I cry. ""I just need to pay for it!""
(He dumps the coffee and starts preparing a new one. Sigh)
He returns with a new coffee: ""Here you go. Medium hazelnut with skim and two Splenda.""

((Deep breath))

""No. Medium french vanilla. Milk. Sugar. Please.""

Another dump, another creation. What a waste.

I will not patronize this location again."
163,dunkin-new-york-102,2014-07-25,1,"I don't ever come here for coffee, but T really wanted something cold to help with the humidity and kept talking about their Oreo Coolatta.

I never had a Coolatta before and T kept describing it and convinced S that Coolatta was our saviour.

I didn't really want a Coolatta, but again, didn't want to make two trips in the humidity that I just went along with the majority.

S and I got the Oreo Coffee Bean Coolatta, since I figured the one that T got that was the Oreo Vanilla Bean Coolatta would be too sugary.

Okay, they messed up my order and gave me the Coffee Coolatta and they ghettoed it by throwing in some Oreo bits.

Okay, this Coolatta is disgustingly sweet - why did I listen to T again? I forgot I don't like T's taste in food or drinks. Everything that T has raved about has not been good.

I am sorry, this Coolatta did not cool me off, instead it just made me crazy in the middle of class.

Not good at all.

Never drinking coffee from here again.

They need to lighten up on the sugar."
163,dunkin-new-york-102,2014-05-06,4,"Very heavy handed with additions here (milk, sugar, etc.) so you may like it if you enjoy a pound of sugar in your coffee. However they'll create your drink just how you like it if you make sure to be specific. 

Friendly and quick service... I appreciate their speed in the morning when the store is packed and I'm late for work. 

As far as a midtown dunkin' goes, pretty good."

163,dunkin-new-york-102,2014-01-28,1,"So the Dunkin' Donuts in my town is one of the better / cleaner ones, and so I have higher standards for DD's.

In terms of donuts, this was okay (they actually gave me a free one because they were close to closing time, so yay for that)

Cleanliness: my friend saw flies and other bugs all over, so I will most definitely not be coming here for my donuts!"
163,dunkin-new-york-102,2012-12-27,1,"Need to find a better staff / manager!  The working style at this Dunkin Donuts seems different than all others.  They yell at you when you walk in the door, you finally get to the register to order/pay and then you slide to the side as you wait for your order.

Sadly, the completion if the order isn't always the same as what was paid for which I sadly found out after walking back to my office.  Even after going back they tried to ""rescue"" the order by manually fixing it instead of making a new one.

I've been to plenty of Dunkin Donuts to know this isn't how it really should be done.

Skip this one unless you can't find anything else anywhere!!"

Tiny, but enough space to sit for a few minutes and wolf down my food.

Sufficient turnover you don't worry about the food being stale, clean enough to eat at, and when in New York, do like the locals do and eat at Dunkin Donuts? Ok the probably noticed the camera I was carrying and knew I was a tourist, but no one cared. Woohoo?"
163,dunkin-new-york-102,2011-03-31,2,"IF the fast talking, fast working employees get your order right the first time then it will have been the shortest wait for a coffee ever. 

The lines move very quickly which a plus but that is about it. I would go to another location if I could but this one is the most convenient, The employees all like look pretty sketchy to me but I've never had a problem with them besides them yelling at you asking for your order the moment you walk in the door. Then they yell your order out loud in hopes of someone paying attention to make your coffee. Also, when I clearly say 2 Splenda do not turn around a second later and say 1 Splenda. 

There is barely any room for seating so your going to want to take it to go."

My rating is for service at this location:

Barely 1 Star for the staff.  In the mornings, I get it that it's a mad rush of people coming in for breakfast... but still should be some organization.  You have the cashiers yelling out orders (some times incorrectly) and side help bringing out the orders, but they just drop the coffee or items on the counter without letting the customers know who's order is who's.  ""Uhh Hello... all the coffee cups look the same!""  Just horrible location, they really need to revamp their service attitude."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2020-02-14,4,"I like Maison Kayser for their bread, not so much their cakes and pastries.  I prefer Financier Patisserie for their cakes and pastries.  It's a tradition of mine to go to Maison Kayser on Valentine's Day for their heart shaped baguette.  I go to a different location every year (there's so many locations now).  This is probably the best location I've been to.  This location was not that crowded since it's on 3rd Ave and there's a lot of seating compared to other locations.  My sister and I ordered the heart shaped baguettes and coffee.  You can ask the staff for butter and jam.  The staff were very friendly and offered to wrap each baguette and place each one in a separate bag individually which was nice. The baguettes were fresh, crunchy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside.  I would come back to this location."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2020-02-06,1,"If there is an option for 0-star then, this place would definitely deserve it. I have been craving for their Mont Blanc ever since I got back from Europe. I went into the shop and wanted to ask the staff to see if they still had any left since it was late afternoon already. I waited by the pastry section, and no one came by so I figured they are busy and decided to get in line to ask the front. It was almost my turn and some other guy just decided to pop in the store and cut in front of me. The worst part was the cashier knew I was next in line and decided to help the line cutter  instead. I was furious and walked up to the cashier and told him I was next in line and he just gave me a dirty look. I proceed to ask him if they still have any Mont Blancs left in the back. He just stared at me blankly and repeated ""Mont Blanc?"" He then asked me what is a Mont Blanc, he has never heard of such thing.  Are you serious?! You work at a pastry store that sells mont blancs and you don't even know what that is?! Management should seriously reevaluate the people you are hiring."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2020-01-18,3,This review isn't for the pastry selection. I've enjoyed trying new desserts at the Bryant Park location but I had the worst macchiato. That may just be how all locations serve it but my cup was filled maybe 1/5 of just espresso. Would not order that again.
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2019-10-22,4,Nice and clean bakery on the east side. Near grand central station. They have a variety of breads and pastries galore!  Lots of chocolate and strawberry options!!!
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2019-10-13,1,"You know it's crazy... when someone messes up they should apologize. When a customer asks for a straw because you've been holding on to your iced coffee for 5 mins- you should say one second and get it to me.
Don't continue talking to customers not looking at me and saying one minute.

I asked for the goat cheese quiche- they forgot about it. Then when they realized it they warmed up the wrong one. It had bacon in it. I don't eat bacon. She doesn't have the audacity to say so so sorry i will get you the right one right away. 

I said that's really strange that she messed up sooo much. Then the black girl- don't know her name says ""don't say that it's the two of us and is walking away"".

As a staff member you should stop moving. And listen to me. I just ate something i religiously don't believe in. Don't give me attitude and roll your eyes.


Whoever hired her. Should definitely reconsider. She's rude!!! And if you don't like a customer service job get the Helllll out."

164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2019-08-27,5,One of my favorite places for breakfast pastries and coffee in the city. Always try to stop in when I have the chance.
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2019-08-18,4,"Yummmmm!  Offering my fav croissant in Paris, I saw Maison Kayser bear the office & thought score!

But remembering other locations whose croissants that didn't match up to the quality of Paris, I opted for a caprese sandwich on olive bread & it was divine

Soft, flavorful bread with thick slices of mozzarella & tomatoes all slathered in a nice basil pesto.

Paired it with corn & couscous salad & it was a meal-complete

And of course, who can leave a patisserie without a treat so got an almond pear tart for dessert.  Tender & just a little sweet. Hit the spot!

Je t'aime!"
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2019-08-14,5,"I can only speak to the walk up bakery situation here, I think it looks like they have a restaurant as well. 

We came across this place when walking by because the baked goods looked tempting (and they were!). We ordered two tarts I believe, one lemon and one chocolate (so much chocolate). They were both outstanding but the chocolate one was the perfect amount of rich, sweet, and bitter.

We also went for coffee. No iced coffee here unfortunately but they have cold brew. Staff was mostly friendly, barista seemed a little overwhelmed maybe there needs to be two people working in the coffee area rather than just one.

For the bakery I don't recall there being a place to sit, there is a more formal restaurant next door. 

Very cute place, outstanding baked items."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2019-05-01,1,"Hey there manager of this location. I'll send out an email to make sure you know the 15 dollars an hour you pay them obviously they mean nothing to them. I walked in there last night after returning from eating at Yasuda. I wasn't in a bad mood, I wasn't hungry or angry and looking to let it out on someone. It just so happens they have terrible desert selection at sushi yasuda so I end up at your location.
Last night 3 girls were working there. I walk in and they are chatting with each other. 
They don't even look at me and they don't acknowledge me or my companion.  
I am not a princess, and I don't need to be greeted or whatever, I just wanted them to stop talking to each other so I could tell them wtf I wanted to get so I could leave them alone. 
All three of the employees look at me all surprised that I walked up the register and expected one of them to say ""hello what would you like"" or something like that. Instead I had to look at them equally confused as to who I should be talking to to buy a god damn cake.
The tags at the display are mixed up and the description doesn't match the item so I had to point at what I wanted. The girl that took my order was like ""you want *enter here the name of a different item*?""
I say no I want what I am pointed at that doesn't sound like what I want. The lady was like ""that's chocolate cake. You want the chocolate cake?""
Yaaaas. I want the chooooocolate caaaake. I don't know you call it choooocolate caaaaake I've never been to your store befooooore so you could be calling it Uncle Sam, there is no tag that matches with what that is. Why you looking at me like an aaaaaalien for? 
I tell them I want it to stay, they still gave it to me in a box and with plastic silverware. I am pretty sure that location has plates and silverware they were just to god damn lazy AF to bother. 
Now you must be thinking ""why is that nasty person writing all this?""
Because it's unfair to all the people that actually work for their 15/hr and they honor their pay. 
You are getting paid. Work like you are."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2019-04-27,5,This bakery was near to my hotel. I went there for breakfast and ordered adagio cake and hot chocolate. The quality of the chocolate cake was excellent. It was fresh and delicious. My brother ordered a croissant and it was also delicious. The hot chocolate was also delicious. I recommend this place.
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2019-04-07,4,"The desserts at Maison Kayser are delicious! Some I like more than others but I don't think you can really go wrong picking one. The staff is very helpful at this location, offering recommendations based on my preference (chocolate vs fruity and texture). 

I haven't had a problem finding a seat the two times I've been, but keep in mind that this is a midtown spot that many people will come to during the work day for a cup of coffee/meeting/interview and also some tourists since it's near Grand Central. However, it's also good for grab and go!

One thing that I noticed is that even when you order a dessert for ""here"" (as opposed to ""to-go"") it gets put in a nice box. Don't get me wrong, the box is pretty but it also makes me think of the waste. I understand it's easier for clean up than a real plate (no kitchen/dish washing here) and maybe looks better than a paper plate but I think some sort of alternative disposable plate could work. Just a thought.

My favorite pastry is the mango one called ""Mangodor"" (although I'm biased because I love most mango or mango-flavored food). It was absolutely delicious mango mousse cake with black current cream in the middle ($6.80). 

My second favorite is the raspberry mousse cake with a vanilla creme brûlée center""Cardinal"" which didn't really taste like creme brûlée but still good ($6.80). 

The ""tart citron"" was a good lemon tart but nothing spectacular in my opinion ($5.80).

And the ""adagio"" is a delicious dark chocolate mousse with passion fruit center ($6.80) that really hits the spot when you're craving something chocolatey with a fruity center.

The coffee is good, nothing out of the ordinary.

A staff member told me that the ""mi-cuit"" (chocolate molten lava cake) is warmed up so I am looking forward to trying that next time!

Overall I love the pastries because they are not too sweet, are elegant and have great flavors. However, they are a bit pricey!"
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2019-03-20,1,"This was our first and last experience at this restaurant!
We were a group of 4 adults. We had breakfast. The orders were all wrong, the service was horrible, the food was bad and cold, and the bill was wrong.It cost over 100 dollars!
The only thing good was the almond croissant on the way out..."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2019-03-17,3,Fresh baked goods at an unreasonable cost.  Coffee isn't great and also overpriced. Place comes off French but doesn't compare to true French quality (not price).
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-12-23,1,"This is your go-to place if you want to buy pencil-shaving tasting, stale (!), hard cookies in a sweet little bag in a clean cafe, for $40.  Yep, $40 got me a mixture of ""hard-as-nails"" and as tasty-as-sawdust oatmeal raisin, pistachio-white chocolate, and pecan-chocolate chip cookies and one chocolate croissant (haven't eaten the croissant, yet).  Would have been much better to hold me up at gunpoint and take my $40 because then you would have saved me the trip to the trash can.  Even my sugar-addicted son and his friends rejected these cardboard nightmares.  SHAME ON YOU!! for robbing me blind, in the light of day."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-11-03,4,"My friend and came here a bit late, before closing time. We grabbed some yogurt and tea and sat by the window. The place looked clean and organized. I just need to try more stuff from here next time. Nice employees."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-10-26,5,"Maison Kayser is truly the Napoleon of French coffeeshops. 

With its engaging interior, its delightful service and its great coffee it has become a great favourite and an invaluable asset on my New York trip. The regular coffee (you can mix it with cream and milk at the counter) is better than any Starbucks and the Almond Croissant has become my favourite morningritual in the big apple. Fantastic stuff, try it out!"
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-10-24,3,"Fun- sugary bite size and larger than your palm options. French inspired. 
We got the chocolate cake- delish. Also the three set sampler. Very good."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-09-28,2,This review is for this location only. There were multiple flies on the baked goods here! :( Definitely check out a different location - I really like their white chocolate brioche and nicosie salad.
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-09-23,3,"Nice alternative to the larger chains.  Coffee is good, croissants and pastries are excellent.  Nice bistro decor, with small two-top tables off to the side and in the back.  Convenient to many hotels nearby, we went for an early, light breakfast before a meeting in midtown.  Mostly takeout; definitely not the place for endless wifi-based work while nursing a coffee all day - this a very good thing for me."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-09-16,1,"Website and door signs says they're open at 8am on sundays. Get there at 8am, staff tells me they're opening late today -- asked when they'll open -- response: ""I don't know"""
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-09-10,4,"Surprised by the negative reviews here, as I've found this unit to be one of the better ones around! The brewed coffee is always hot, fresh and tasty, croissants are flaky and delightful, and the service comes fast with a smile! Also, my favorite sandwich the TUNISEN is loaded with tuna, lettuce, tomatoes, capers and other goodies on a beautiful baguette with some harissa to kick it up -- delicious!"
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-09-05,4,"The plain croissant is light and has a nice airy texture, which I really like! The almond croissant was also very good and had an almond filling inside. If they could tone down on the sweetness and lower the price, I would have no complaints!"
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-07-26,3,"A plus for being clean and having friendly staff.

Their almond pastry/ Danish was delicious. Lots of almond slices and best of all, not too sweet, just perfect .

While their pastries may be a winner, however, I don't think they specialized in desserts or cakes. I also ordered the raspberry creme burlee, chocolate tart and pecan tart. All of them were only so so. Nothing memorable or special.

Definitely prefer lady m over this."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-07-11,5,"The Staff are courteous and helpful, which are bonuses since their range of food offerings are fresh and delicious!  Nice place to hang out in midtown east.

Frequenting Maison Kayser at any time would give everyone a chance to enjoy a variety of food selections.  Those that I had tried were all quite satisfying.

The Manager, Mr. Yi, is very customer oriented.  They have my loyalty and the best almond croissant amongst the competitors!!!"
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-07-02,3,"Last weekend, I went here for breakfast and ordered a tropical iced tea and a croque monsieur. The tropical iced tea was good. The sandwich was piping out when it came out. The edges of the sandwich were a bit hard but the sandwich was savory. Hope to try other things here next time."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-07-01,3,"Maison Kayser, I didn't know, is a coffee chain. I guess in the New York area. We stay at Wyndham 45 Midtown, which is a block away. Right on a corner, ready to serve. 
We met some friends there, I was doing Tarot readings while on vacation and that seemed like a good place to meet. There is a room in the back with music, but the front is not too loud. 
I ordered a large Americano $3. 75 and Croissant Aux Amandes (Almond Croissant) $4.90. 
The coffee was good, the croissant, which I was expecting to be sweet, wasn't and had some kind of cream inside. 
I'd go back for the coffee but I'll try a different pastry."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-07-01,4,"Stopped by bakery for the first time yesterday. I has a regular hot coffee that was very good. There are a descent variety of options in terms of sweetening/cream to your coffee. There were samples at the front counter of goodies such as chocolate ""cupcakes"", breads etc. The samples were amazing! Ordered a rich chocolate cookie for my daughter and it was everything one would want in a chocolate cookie; rich, not overly sweet and tasted homemade. Maison K is definitely worth a visit when you're in the area. I believe that there are many options such as sandwiches, soups etc. my daughter and I were mesmerized by the displayed goods and didn't focus on the menu. 

I should also mention that the bakery was clean, spacious and the service was excellent."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-06-18,1,"Been here a couple of times. Last time ordered Macchiato, got something else starting with M. After asking for it to be replaced, I was reprimanded and asked to ""be careful"" when I order. Rude manners. Hope they improve."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-04-07,5,"I'm so happy they finally opened one of these in this neighborhood. We definitely needed a good bakery with delicious bread. Not only is there bread delicious, they also have awesome sandwiches especially the goat cheese butternut squash and arugula sandwich. Their coffee is also delicious and so are all the sweet treats they have. The employees that work there are super nice and the space is gorgeous. Definitely stop by if you're in the area and want a healthy serving of carbs."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-03-30,4,"I usually get the pistachio éclair or the mixed fruit tart.

one of 3 in the area."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-03-22,1,"I bought my first Chocolate Almond Croissant here and I almost had to spit it out when I took my first bite. I wasn't exactly sure but the inside looked a bit raw to me as if the croissant wasn't fully baked. Otherwise the flavor wasn't too bad. Not so sure if it worth the $4.65 in quality. 

Attached a photo for reference."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-03-04,4,"I pretty much always come to Maison Kayser for either coffee or baguette (or sometimes croissant). There's just something about Kayser's baguette that I love. 
So excited for this particular location since it's just a few blocks away from my office.
Unfortunately, the baguette price went up. I guess it's NYC and you can't really find any good baguette in 1 euro."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-01-24,1,Very slow rude service.  I stood in a line there was only one woman on the register taking orders another restocking shelves another making the drinks. The woman on the register seemed to enjoy keeping people waiting. She acted like she had all the time in the world and showed active disinterest towards customers.
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2018-01-15,2,"I am all about letting new spots work out their kinks before judging. But in this case, there is not much of a leash for a franchise known for its delicious pastries and are rapidly expanding their presence in midtown Manhattan. If customer service and the pastries are noticeable lesser quality than other locations, then it deserves to be highlighted. The quality of the pastries are the most egregious. The famous almond croissant is quite inconsistent when it comes to texture and freshness in the few opportunities I have gotten to try it.  Two stars for being in a convenient location and being clean, but I would agree with others that would rather walk an extra two blocks to the Bryant Park location."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2017-12-24,1,Worst location of Maison Kayser ever! Avoid at all costs! Completely disorganized and below zero customer service! Employees are rude and seemed put off that they had to take your order. Cashier doesn't understand barista terminology- ordered a latte and got a cappuccino with nothing but foam  Don't waste your money here - go to the one in Bryant Park.
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2017-12-15,1,"I'm giving 1 star because of my immense disappointment. I am so in love with the Adagio cake that i pre-ordered and pre-paid for it a week in advance (for my birthday!) because i know how fast they sell out. I go to pick up my order at the set time i requested, and by the prices and looks of the place I'm expecting efficient service. Unfortunately what i received was slowness and cluelessness, in my opinion unacceptable. They told me they could not find my cake and presented something that was similarish after making me wait around and speaking with three separate people. They could not give me an explanation other than ""they might have sold it to someone else."" 

Needless to say, the cake I left with was not the cake I ordered, desired, or paid for."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2017-12-14,3,"Paper cups, even if you're staying in at the lovely marble tables. A trashy touch that succumbs to the worst laziness and cheapness of 20th century US food culture. Also agree with others that the order/pay staging is confusing. But everything else is great; high-quality food in a cozy setting. Great addition to the neighborhood if management would just fix these few errors."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2017-12-09,4,"This is a good cafe, the prices are high but What do you expect for being in midtown. Their is plenty of seating. I will be back this is a good place and never to crowded. I will be back this is a good cafe in the area."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2017-12-04,5,"Very tasty grab-and go baguette sandwiches, which is what I've mainly come here for. The pastries are also good. And there seems to be ample cafe-style seating. They might still be sorting out the flow of the check-out process as it's new, but nothing that's bothered me."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2017-12-01,1,We went in looking for a simple chocolate chip cookie. Where else better than a bakery right? The lines were confusing and the lady who helped us was rude and condescending.  They did not have chocolate chip cookies. The lady beside us just turned around and walked out. There are a lot of options for cookies in this area. I would avoid this one.
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2017-12-01,2,"Been here once but not impressed. I work in the building but lines are usually so long I avoid. The morning of 12/1 it wasn't as busy so I went in to grab a croissant. Ordering/fulfillment ""process"" is confusing. Multiple registers, multiple lines and lots of staff milling around makes for a chaotic experience (no doubt why lines are always super long). I ordered but was given no indication of where or when my order would show up. I stepped aside to let others order, then the guy who took my order asked what I wanted. I explained that I'd already ordered and paid and wasn't clear where to get my stuff and the cashier came back with serious attitude. He declared that I get my croissant from him but, since I moved away from the register I was at fault (my fault he failed to deliver my croissant and went on to service other customers apparently). Not going back to be admonished by some kid for not being able to sift through the chaos that their disorganized staff is creating. More training required here please. Croissant was fine, not exceptional but fine."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2017-11-28,1,"Disappointing. I am a Kayser regular and I was very excited to have a location opened near my office. I was expecting a hot lunch, as I've had in other Kayser's locations, and I only found a wall full of expensive pre-made sandwiches and a mushroom soup overloaded with flour. The cashier was very rude. Forks and knives are not easily accessible, you have to request them at the counter (plastic ones, of course). They offered us bread for the soup, then forgot about it and about our spoons. The tables were not clean. Simply put, it's a chic-place wannabe and I don't recommend it as a lunch spot."
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2017-11-27,4,"I love this place and am so glad that it opened and took the place where Cosi was as something like this was truly missing in this area of the city. This place has a great variety of sandwiches, pastries, and salads and has a nice clean seating area. Everything tastes fresh and the people that work there are great. I do think they have some kinks they need to get out as this location is crazy new, but once they get there, I think this location will be even better. Their service is fast and the seating area is great. I'll definitely come here again!"
164,maison-kayser-new-york-36,2017-11-16,4,"It recently opened so I haven't gotten much of a chance to try out their items but I've been to other locations and have never been disappointed. Now that there is a location close to my office and on the way to work, I will definitely be stopping by. The location is very spacious but doesn't appear to have table service like some Maison Kaysers. All in all, place is nice and lots of varieties from pastries, to sandwiches, to cakes to salads."
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2019-01-08,1,I'm a regular customer of this location and happened to be fasting. I went into the store and asked how much for a cup of hot water. Would you believe they charged $1.49 plus tax for a small cup of hot water?  This will be my last purchase at this location. I'll also make sure to pass on the information to my co-workers.
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2018-07-14,1,"Service is absolutely horrible. I've gone there on countless occasions and they can never get my order right. They mess it up every single time. Put the wrong meat in my sandwiches, wrong milk, etc. On top of that, they're very rude when THEY ARE the ones getting my order wrong. I don't understand how they are still open."
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2017-07-16,1,"This place is great for
Seating, but they really need a lesson on making a coffee and it's sad because all they have to do is put it on the machine and the coffee machine will make it for them. Seemingly they do not know How to do that. 1 person working, along line, I would not come here, their is lack of skills to put coffee and milk in the same cup. I'd rather walk 5 blocks to another one than come back. If I could give it 1/2 star I would, half for some available seating but other than that. I would avoid this place."
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2017-07-04,1,The doughnut I bought was hard n not fresh at all..so disappointed..since NY supposed to be the mothers of Dunkin doughnuts place!! :(
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2016-12-30,1,I do have to agree this DnD is awful!  My job is located right around the corner. Thought it would be a great spot for tea n bagel for thing 7 am. Well I was wrong. The woman barely understand me multiple times I have gone in. They never put sugar in my tea and I always ask for skin milk never get it. And they barely had any bagels or donuts early this morning. Like it was 645 am and it's NYC. How do you not any of the main supplies for DnD. And I do have to agree. I NEVER receive my receipts when I go. I always give choices to people due to bad days. But I cannot say it's bad days anymore. They are just plan bad!!!
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2016-08-05,2,This Dunkin donuts wasn't great at all. Stopped by for just an iced decaf caramel latte with skim milk and they messed up the order. It was also very slow. There was a long wait for orders and they weren't even right. I waited for over 15 mins for my coffee.
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2016-06-23,1,"Wow. They have like 4 donut types in the morning. Online says open until 10pm but they will tell you on the phone at 9:15pm that they closed ""early"" without reason. Terrible."
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2016-03-16,5,"I checked the Dr. Oz magazine article online so that I could try one of the ""Fast Food breakfasts"" that Dr OZ says is ok to enjoy.  Dr. Oz has a great list of bkfst take out. 

For $1.99, I did enjoy the ""wrap"", but it's really like a thin white pancake--bread, & inside was the TURKEY SAUSAGE, egg white, & cheese, but, I am sure I also got to enjoy an egg yoke, inside there too. IT WAS VERY GOOD. 

The place is clean, as I look around from my seat in the back.

SERVICE, FINE!! Lady was patient, I did confirm with her that what I was ordering, as I pointed to photo on wall menu above where orders are placed would be $1.99.  She answered questions from the guy ahead of me, she answered my questions. I got my change. NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT SERVICE. 

Donut selection looked pretty good .  
It is 2016--so, this is a whole after some of the negative reviews I've seen on here.

Verdict: GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY.  See my photos.
Location is NEAR NYU's world-famous, RUSK INSTITUTE, Located on East 38th street.

THIS DUNKIN' DONUTS IS ON 3RD AVENUE, near East 38th street."
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2015-10-19,1,"Ridiculous waiting time, longer than the doctor's office. Staff was not helpful at all, one of them was serving somebody else and forgot my order. All most all dunkin donut stores have ridiculous long line, the one at 250 E. 40th St, New York, NY 10016 was as bad as this."
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2015-03-05,1,If you're into roaches and bad service look no further . My favorite employee of all time that knows how to really push you over is Bony( i think was her name )
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2014-12-31,1,"Omg I tried to give them time because the people seemed new that we're working there, but enough is enough! Terrible! The food the coffee and especially the service!! They mess up the order every single time! It's close to my job and I had already walked past my usual DD on 34th, the steak on my sandwich today looks like fried dog poop! It's harder then cement . I called and complained and they asked did I have a receipt !! They never offer the receipt!!! I have had to ask on several other visits for the receipt . I even told them how other DD always give one and how they will give u your order free if they don't give u one. 
Never ever again will I go there except to get my money back today!! They all need training including the manager!"
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2014-10-16,1,"As if!  This Dunkin Donuts is the equivalent of a virgin who can't drive!

Came for some iced coffee.  Took awhile to order because the woman in front of me was double charged for a small coffee and they couldn't/wouldn't give her a receipt so she could show them.  It really seemed like they were trying to scam her because her English wasn't the best.

After that was resolved, a lady took my order.  Of course, as I gave it to her (large iced coffee) she turned and spoke to her co-worker, then asked me again what I wanted.  As I replied the SECOND time, she again turned and spoke to her co-worker.  Then she asked me a THIRD time what I wanted, and she was able to get it that time.

Then I waited for my iced coffee.  Two people behind me ordered (a coffee & hot tea and an iced latte, respectively) and got their orders and then the same woman who took my order asked (for the fourth time) what I was having.

The coffee was okay but dealing with a scamming bunch of morons is not worth it.  Go someplace else.

----------------------
I meant to mention that the people who work there are clueless, hence my two opening statements."
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2014-06-13,1,Normally I wouldn't bother writing a review however I'm very irked. This location is supposed to close at 10pm. I was in desperate need of coffee and got here at 9:50pm and the doors were already locked!! I pulled on the door and nothing! The worker even came out from the back to look at me and then went back! I will never go to this location again
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2013-08-15,2,"Fine if all you want is a cup of coffee.  Anything else, you're asking too much.

Non-existent selection of donuts, warmed sandwiches can come out cold, and they are a total mess if you ask for ice cream from the Baskin Robbins section."
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2013-04-17,1,"Normally wouldn't review a Dunkin.... But this one is particularly deserving of a 1 star review. I went once and my breakfast sandwich was cold in the middle. Several months later I gave it another shot... I ordered, waited a few minutes and was told they didn't have what I wanted, then waiting again to get my refund while they began taking another customer's order. I was like ""what?"""
165,dunkin-new-york-144,2011-08-06,1,"I went here with my friends after an early dinner.  Wanted to get some mint choc chip ice cream and noticed there was none left in the container.  I asked the guy if he had anymore left and he looked & said what do you mean in a rude tone! SERIOUSLY?!?! I asked if he had a new one to open up & he gave me another look & rudely replied NO!!!  Instead of saying I'm sorry we don't have anymore or let me check & see he was very rude to me.  Did I order anything else?  NOPE!  I won't be stopping @ this location any time soon.  HELLO!!! If you don't like your job & you can't deal with the public then you shouldn't be there.  Everyone has bad days but your job is to serve customers on a daily basis.  I'm sure someone else can use that job.  If you want rude service this is the place to get it otherwise, skip and go to another location because there's PLENTY around!"
166,shoe-bar-new-york-3,2020-01-28,5,"You can drink anywhere on the floor. There is no downside! I had a mule which could've been stronger but was good. The rose I had next was notably better. Plus, they have happy hour from 3-7pm making this an excellent after-work spot."
166,shoe-bar-new-york-3,2020-01-13,5,Bomb Prosecco. Who doesn't love to drink & shop?! Quick & kind service & they have a happy hour that includes all of the cocktails & most wines.
166,shoe-bar-new-york-3,2019-12-10,5,"A real bar in a major department store located right in the middle of the women's shoe floor one level down.
 
Shoe Bar is a casual space featuring handcrafted drinks, cocktails and specialty coffee drinks, they didn't have the Romana Sambuca so next time I will sneak in one of those little bottles.
 
They offer a selection of small plates also from one of the restaurants on the floor below.
 
If you are a guy then it's the perfect spot to chill while you special friend checks out the shoes tell her to pick up the tab =}"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2020-03-16,5,Great coffee and pastry. I had the banana nut cake and it was delicious. Wonderful service by Greg- thank you
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2020-03-16,5,I love the coffee here! Favorite spot near my work their lattes are so rich and delicious. The workers here are NICEST always puts a smile on my face :)
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2020-03-13,5,"The turmeric latte is so special, recommended! The location is clean and staffs are friendly... Enjoying a lovely Friday lunch break here!"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2020-03-13,5,Gregory's Coffee is one of the better coffee chain in the city. This location is super convenient to my office and the staff are super friendly and helpful.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2020-02-25,4,"This location was crowded around 4pm but I was able to place my order and receive my drink in a timely manner. The staff was friendly and insightful of the menu, I only wish they called out names with the drink as this was a busier location. I ordered a house made hot chai latte and it was good. I really like the espresso drinks here too! I'd definitely come back here again in the afternoon."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2020-02-23,1,"I had to wait 20 minutes for my latte, and I had to ask when my latte will be ready.  They served people who came in after me.   Their response was that my drink wasn't an espresso drink and they had several of those orders.  I had a latte, which I thought was an espresso drink.  Their response was very rude.  disappointing."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2020-02-15,2,I'm giving this location a 2 rating b/c they're customer service was horrible! The 2 girls that was working at 7:15am Saturday 02/15/2020 an Asian girl and a Hispanic girl were very rude not welcoming at all and wasn't at all knowledgeable about their products. This was my 1st time at Gregory's and I've heard so many good things about the food and drinks here. The drink and breakfast sandwich was very yummy but customer service is what brings guest back. I work for the hotel industry's so I was sending a lot of guest to this location and after this experience I'm sending them to another location. It's 18 degrees outside and I wasn't  even offered a bag for my sandwich and I wasn't offered a sleeve for my cold beverage . And when I asked for my drink glow up iced the (Hispanic) girl told me it only comes hot I said well your menu says iced or hot she said oh. Then walked to the back.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-12-29,4,"Was looking for some Cold brew and found it! 
Hall & Oats is very good ! Also had a awesome loaf .
Very friendly service!"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-11-14,2,"Got a latte here, took one sip, and threw it in a trash can outside. The milk was foamed and burnt. Not sure what happened -- I used to go to the Gregory's on 30th and it was always fine. The cashier who took my order was also the person making drinks so it's possible the actual barista was on a break or something. Regardless, I'm never coming back here. Sad."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-10-10,5,"h.... serves was amazing and everyone was super friendly! Michelle made my drink and she was super sweet, and made sure it tasted amazing!!! Our first coffee place in NY and it was a great experience."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-10-07,5,Despite this location being so near to time square the people who work there are always friendly and drinks are always delicious! I love the unique flavor combos they have for their seasonal drinks.!!
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-10-01,5,"I am all about good customer service and that's exactly what I received here, even during a rush. I came in to grab a scone, (it was recommend by a friend) but was a bit indecisive. However, with the recommendation of Michelle I tried the Banana Walnut Bread, and it was GREAT. She didn't rush me, as I asked several questions, and not once did she seem annoyed by my lack of knowledge when it came to the store menu. It was in fact my first time there and I WILL be returning"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-10-01,5,So glad this location is here! Working in Times Square is often irritating and this location offers a small reprieve with its convenient location and an amazing staff that can manage both the tourist and rush hour flow. It's also so nice to have an option for coffee and bakery items that are better quality and more delicious than most of the more generic nearby locations offer. This Gregory's helps me look forward to the day!
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-09-27,5,"Hands down, The BEST Banana Bread. Say goodbye to Starbucks wimpy pieces. Hello Gregory's. I also recently discovered on top of their amazing drip coffee and cappuccinos (my go to AM and PM breaks) I have a new love affair with their chai tea latte's!  It tastes like an actual chai tea latte!  It's not watered down, and not too sweet!   Always clean, always quick, and everyone is ALWAYS smiling!  Great addition to Midtown West!"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-09-26,4,"Quality of coffee was amazing. Friendliness and helpfulness of barista not too impressed. Overall, would recommend for a coffee on the go! Just don't ask too many questions."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-09-26,1,Tea was fine.  The food was awful.  My cranberry scone left me sad and the yogurt with fruit and granola was like soggy sawdust.  I hope I remember to never return to this place of shattered morning dreams.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-09-25,5,"I come here 1 to 3 times a week. Sometimes only for one if their many coffee options, sometimes for a Sandwich or pastry,Many options to choose from! Don't be discourage for the long line sometimes you see in the mornings, specially in the summer months... they move the line very fast, and the little wait is worth it!"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-09-25,5,Great coffee and quick service nothing else to ask for NYC residents!!  I ordered a soy au lait and for some reason it tastes better than any other coffee shop
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-09-20,5,"Stumbled into this gorgeous coffee shop close to Time Square  and was absolutely charmed by the relaxing atmosphere, tasty, good quality food all served by the most cheerful, friendly, helpful staff . I could not recommend this little gem enough , try it! Not to mention it serves the best coffee I've ever tasted."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-07-29,2,Their breakfast sandwiches are not good. I would steer away from ordering them. Very tasteless.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-07-26,4,"Delicious coffee and very cute shop!
The iced vanilla latte is a delicious classic option. We ended up having no wait in line and the coffee came out really fast. There is not a whole lot of seating but this location is mostly for people on the go. It interior is very beautiful with high ceilings, hanging light bulbs, shiplap walls, plants and big windows."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-07-23,1,"This is the slowest Gregory's I've ever been to. Granted, they are super busy. But waiting 20 minutes for an iced machiatto to be made is ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and walk to the next Gregory's or simply get yourself coffee elsewhere because this place will have you waiting forever!"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-07-09,3,"Amazing coffee with horrible services!!!- the ice matcha tea for me.  What a palatable release of notes in your mouth. Always the right synergy of ice to partake in this matcha duet.  Satisfied wit the product but  not a fan of modern day customer service.  No sense of hospitality or eye contact.  The easiest lesson I know, if you hate your job - do us all a favor and quit . .   I shall return and expect a better service."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-06-24,5,Their coffee was rich and flavorful. I enjoyed the regular brew. Definitely coming back
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-06-14,4,"We were a bit early for a Broadway show, so decided to grab a seat and a drink. Nutella cold brew was excellent! As expected, super busy location. I can't imagine it would be great for getting work done, but alas people were trying."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-05-14,1,I wanted to like this place so bad as it is on my way to work but sadly the coffee is disgusting  the app doesn't give un option to substitute the milk option so I was stuck with disgusting oat milk. It's not for everyone
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-04-27,1,"I ordered an oat cappuccino specifically because I have lactose intolerance with one shot of espresso. I was served a regular cappuccino with whole milk. I made a few sips and realized that it's a regular milk. I asked whether it's an oat milk, they said it's a whole milk. I asked to change it stating that I have an allergy. Instead of apologizing the staff made me pay for the oat milk $1.03. I was shocked! They were extremely rude and didn't give any explanations, just laughed instead. Now I have a sharp stomach ache and can't even drink my oat cappuccino they made. I was always recommending the Gregory's coffee to everyone, but with this kind of attitude and stupid mistakes, I'll rather go to more costumers oriented places."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-04-20,4,Stopped by to grab a coffee for the hubs. Figured might as well try something new. Didn't realize this was a chain. Hubs said it was gooood. So good he went back to another location the next day to grab some more!
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-04-16,3,Such a cute place! A fan of their original concoctions. Definitely recommend trying Hall & Oats!
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-03-22,4,"Through the Ritual app, Gregory's Coffee was offering the spicy avocado toast for $1 (regular price $7). I mean, for a dollar, this toast was legit. Really thick slice of multigrain bread and a spicy avocado spread (red pepper flakes in a hot oil). It was delicious and filling. I wish there was more avocado though especially for the regular $7 price. I would never buy it at its regular price. This avocado toast must be why the articles say millennials can't afford homes."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-03-08,5,I received a message from the manager a few hours after posting the review below. It made me so happy to se how quickly they take care of potential issues. He offered me a complementary drink and pastry. I'm happy to see two baristas working behind the counter today. What an improvement. I'll be back!
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-02-22,4,"For a fairly big and quickly growing chain coffee spot, they do make some good specialty coffee. The pastries and other breakfast items are also pretty good and worth picking up. The coffee itself is quite flavorful and compares well to other third wave coffee spots. Considering it has larger chain perks like mobile ordering and pick up, it's no wonder it's super popular and there's often a line."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-02-21,3,"I work nearby and my go-to is For Five Coffee and occasionally Blue Bottle in Rockefeller Plaza. But I wanted something different so I trekked over to Gregorys Coffee. I haven't been here for a long time and I was surprised to see there were many kinds of smoothies offered now! I'm looking forward to trying one of the smoothies sometime. On the other hand, latte here was OK - the caffeine flavor was a little too weak for my taste."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-02-20,3,"Small location. Their coffee is always on point. I'm a fan of their coffee but this location always has stale baked goods, not fresh at all. NOT good, specially for how much money it costs."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-02-19,1,"Really bad customer service , im a tourist and didnt feel that i was being treated like one !  Come down to Florida i will show your ladies how to give an excellent customer service. !"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-02-16,5,Friendly quick and delicious- the way that coffee should be. I went there every morning on my visit this past week and will be coming back next time I am in NY.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-01-15,4,Coffee presentation was nice. Seating was nice. Ambiance was nice. Doughnut was dry. Brownie was dry. Parfait was delicious.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2019-01-01,4,Perfectly located in the heart of Times Square and a great alternative to Starbucks. Coffee was great and so was the service.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-12-15,2,How do you not have whipped cream when you are a cafe? On the plus side they have free WiFi and I had a place to sit for 30 minutes before a show on a December night. Around the same price as Starbucks but at least Starbucks has whipped cream.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-10-18,3,"I usually love Gregory's specifically for their dirty chai. I went in this afternoon because the Ritual app was offering $1 deal (any size) on select coffees at Gregory's. I ordered ahead via the app and the drink was ready for pick up in a few minutes (no line when I got into the store). I went for the ""Nu"" brew hotshot, which is supposed to be hot coffee, milk, and Nutella. As delicious as that sounds, it fell SO short of my expectations. In reality, my drink tasted like watered down coffee. No hint of the delicious chocolatey Nutella I was hoping for. I mainly hung on to the drink to keep my hands warm while I walked around in the cold lol. I would have been really upset if I paid full price for this drink. Sounded like it would be really good, but I wouldn't recommend it."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-10-08,4,"I've been a fan of Gregorys since I moved to Nyc.  
This location is a smaller space than the others with four, 2 seater, tables and a standing bar.  
I always enjoyed the coffee... a balanced latte ($4.36 for a 12-ounce small size) I can't tell you about the other beverages since the latte is my go to. They do have decaf options so that's a plus for me!
The food options are scarce though.  They have the regular pastries like doughnuts, cakes, scones, muffins... pastries can go for 3-5 dollars each... and they also have some yogurt, hard boiled eggs and cold oatmeal cups.  
So, I'd consider getting a snack here instead of something more substantial.  In any case, it's a good coffee break for me.
If you order via their app you can just come in for pick up at the bar and be on your way!

The free WiFi sucks at this location today though.  It goes in and out."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-10-03,3,"Was excited to try this coffee based on numerous reviews I've read about this place.  And to my surprise - my expectations were higher than reality. Coffee was pretty regular,  nothing tasty. Rather tasted like a slightly burned coffee. Wouldn't bother to come again"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-09-24,5,I love that Gregory's serves oat milk! I also tried the activated charcoal latte for the first time and it was very soothing and delish! I appreciate all the healthy options Gregory's brings to the city! Many of their bakery options are vegan and they also offer fresh healthy toastie options! NYC is lucky to have you Greg!
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-09-22,2,"Needlessly hipster. 

Some stuff about this place I liked... Like the free WiFi.

The food options were spare and a little whack. The bare hard boiled eggs and overnight oats were unnecessarily prominent. Who buys packaged hard boiled eggs in water? 

I got an aeropress Columbian coffee that what awesome but it was accompanied by unwanted attitude.

They also had a bottled ginger sparkling water that was good.

Isn't the bedhead and glasses logo enough?

Despite all the new wave influence there was no recycle bin."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-08-29,1,"Multiple issues with this location, fairly regular customer and tried giving them a chance but now I'm just giving up. Perhaps this is targeted at tourists that are not repeat customers??
- never wear hair nets when preparing food, found hair on several different occasions
-manager is inexperienced at customer service and cannot manage her team - they're extremely slow especially during rush hour, the personnel gossips about customers within earshot, and are generally rude 
- drinks made different each time - lattes and arnold palmers have been consistently inconsistent
I could go on, but this is more than enough. 
That's a no from me dawg!"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-07-22,4,"Grateful for something to mix it up from the Starbucks norm while near work in Times Square.  Unsweet iced tea is my normal go-to and that's hard to mess up, but I enjoyed theirs all the same.  Prices and sizes are decent.  Best deal is that you can download their app (super easy as its powered by LevelUp) and get $5 off your first order and other sweet rewards.  I also spotted a sign about deals on pastries after 5pm.  Granted I showed up about 7:58 for an 8pm closing so the pickings were slim.  I guess that would be my one beef with this place - wish they were open later for we gluttons for punishment who take our caffeine at any hour.  And there's little seating, making it more utilitarian than a hangout.  Still, who doesn't want a cute bespectacled hipster emblazoned on their cup?  I'd take it over Madame Starbucks any day. :)"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-06-25,3,"This location is very small and usually crowded, so I'm the mornings, when I usually go, there is a rush. The staff is usually not engaging in conversation and the few times I've asked questions they either do not know the drinks on the menu or give a short answer. I would compare this to a fast food chain that serves coffee. 

The coffee is decent. I usually get cold brew and I prefer it over Starbucks. The pastries are not good at all. They do not taste or look fresh. 

I recommend this if it is convenient but I think you'd have a better experience going to a Starbucks or artisan coffee shop if possible."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-06-23,5,"Good vegan options. I tried the buckwheat chocolate ball and it was pretty good. The non dairy milk options are almond, oat, and soy, which can be subbed in for 90¢."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-06-22,4,I stood outside and watched my wife order coffee from here. She left happy...so yeah. Three stars. Make it four.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-06-22,3,"I haven't been inside a Gregory's Coffee in at least 2 years. It's usually not in my immediate area near my job. This one happens to be two blocks away from me so I figured I should shake it up a little and go here instead of Starbucks. 

I like the diverse selection of pastries and drinks. This particular location is still pretty low key despite the fact that it's pretty close to times sq and a ton of Broadway shows. There's also a decent amount of seating available.   

I'm a big fan of their non-dairy options for their drinks. I was eager to try one of their drinks with oat milk but sadly I can't comment on how that tastes. I ordered a Chai tea with oat milk but the barista didn't appear to communicate that to the person making the drink. Instead of making a fuss I stuck with the drink as it was prepared because it looked like she was the only one preparing drinks and was overwhelmed. I hope that's not an indication of how they handle a morning rush hour crowd. I came in a little bit after 11 am."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-06-02,4,Great location near Time Square. Employees are polite and courteous.  Turmeric and ginger latte is really good. We had it with almond milk and non fat. Either one is a great choice for a different healthier coffee. Would come back again
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-02-04,2,Probably the worst Latte I have ever had! The pastries are okay. Do yourself a favor and find another spot for coffee. Uggh
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-01-29,4,"Gregory Coffee is a coffee chain that I like. I was at one of the locations years ago and I actually saw Gregory himself mixing up some Java!

This location is cool because its smack in the middle of Time Square tourist central. In a sea of corporate chains serving crappy sugary drinks, Gregorys Coffee can whip up a solid espresso.

My wife & I are waiting for our show to start, we swung into Gregorys Coffee for a cuppa Joe. 

Seating isn't plentiful and I didn't see any bathrooms?? Gregory says get your coffee and GTFO!

Great coffee roast, many drink options and some mite-T-Fine baked goods. Don't expect to be sitting for hours using the WiFi, this spot is small and doesn't have too many seats."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-01-27,4,"What a cool shop as soon as you get off the subway. I ordered the iced mocha, and my friends got the cold crew and vanilla latte. We also got a pumpkin muffin and chocolate chip cookie. Everything was great and it started off our day in the city.

It was a small joint, but it was perfect for the location."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2018-01-10,1,the service was fine and it was fast but that was the worst cold brew i have ever had. it tasted like expired espresso.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-11-09,2,"Amazing service from the staff, and great ambiance. But had a terrible cold brew here, it tasted extremely strange and bitter even after putting in sugar and various syrups. Would not come back for the iced drinks."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-10-16,4,"Stopped here to grab a quick breakfast and coffee before heading out for our tours for the day. The shop is cute but small and during a busy Monday morning, the line was quite long. I got a dirt chai latte and chia seed pudding and was happy with both but had to wait almost 10 minutes for my coffee. Staff was friendly and helpful and the shop was clean and well kept. If you are in the area and want a place to grab a quick snack or drink, this place is great but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-09-10,3,It's ok. Got a vanilla latte and it met the need for caffeine... But nothing to write home about.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-08-28,3,"Gregory's is pretty good. They get you in and out fast. Prices are steep, even for midtown, so I don't make this a regular stop. Things that I've enjoyed here include the Peanut Pleaser smoothie (basically a full meal) and the Swiss oatmeal. They have lots of healthy grab-and-go breakfast options. Decor is nice but virtually no seating."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-07-09,3,"Coffee wasn't my favorite by a long shot.

The service was fantastic and the shop is tiny and cozy. The glazed donut we got was okay. I won't be returning, but this deserves a shot if you're into coffee."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-07-05,1,"Was there this afternoon,was served a stale overpriced $3.00 muffin ,did not get a refund,was not offered an exchange..monday I was served a staled green tea iced tea,....their managers cannot make a very basic decision.
PROFITS COME FIRST AT CLIENTS HEALTH RISKS AND DETRIMENT...GREGORY'S CLAIMS EVERYTHING ORGANIC,NATURAL BUT FORGOT THE WORD """" STALE"""" what a ripoff,what a shame.eve their inexperienced baristas are paid the bare or little more than minimum wage...THAT'S THE WAY IT IS."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-06-06,3,"I find Gregory's to be a pretty solid coffee choice when you don't want Starbucks but are too lazy or too busy to walk to your favorite coffee shop from midtown. The quality of the lattes is always pretty good (not great, not terrible), though I have started to ask for them extra hot because otherwise they're made lukewarm. I do think the baristas could be friendlier sometimes, but it might just depend who's working that day."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-05-24,1,"Worst place ever. Super slow. There were no other customers in line and it took at least 10 minutes just to get tea. And the cashier had to chase after her co-worker to make the tea and coffee we ordered. Food seemed kind of stale and the employees were not knowledgeable at all about their teas and coffees!! I'm in New York for a week and this is the only review I've written and I just couldn't ""not"" write a review! It was that bad!!"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-05-23,1,Cold latte that took a long time in an empty shop.  Asked for another and trainee continued to be the one who made it after the first try.  Left my money behind and went elsewhere.
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-05-19,4,"I ordered an iced cap during the heart of the morning rush (8:30 am), received my drink after a 5 minute wait, and sipped on it all morning! The barista even scooped the foam onto the iced drink, which I love because oftentimes when I order an iced cap at coffee shops, they'll insist on just giving me a plain old latte (there's a difference!). The drink was bold and crisp in flavor, not drowning in milk, and the foam warmed up my iced beverage, which I personally love because I hate overly iced drinks. 

The pricing is fairly steep. My drink cost $5+ and while it tasted great, it certainly was not commensurate to the price. I'll definitely be back to try the iced coffee in the near future!"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-05-06,3,"Good, not great.  Overpriced. Extremely slow - I don't need a heart in the foam of my latte, I just need my latte."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-03-16,3,"I had an Americano and it was fair.  I had high hopes going in since it looked like a fun and funky place, which decor certainly is but the coffee was not very good and in the end I did not even finish it. I can't say I would never go back if I saw another and I had the desire to go in, but I wouldn't travel out of my way to get it."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-02-14,5,"The servers in here were soooo nice and helpful, they made my day. And I had a decaf Americano that was delicious."
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-02-13,4,"Shop was pretty unique and clean. Coffee was pretty basic nothing that stood out. Ordered a soy vanilla latte and soy mocha. I would of gave this joint 3 stars, but they gave us free samples and didn't judge me when I went back for more samples. Thanks guys!"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-02-11,4,Had their coffee tonight for the first time and tried the iced coffee . I bought a bag of their regular coffee and it comes with a free coffee . The bag itself was $12 . The coffee itself is bold and strong . I happen to like coffee that's strong and bold so this works for me . It reminds me of Fika coffee . I'll have to try the coffee at home to see how it brews but so far so good !
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2017-01-31,4,"Well I was a bit skeptical when I saw the 2.5 star rating, but we were in desperate need for coffee that afternoon and we walked right by.  To my delight, the experience was great, service was quick and efficient and the coffee was great!  Workers were friendly and there was space to sit to converse over coffee.  Nothing to be rated a 2.5 stars at all! 

The cashier was still new since he didn't really know the products that well yet, but that's ok because with what he did not know, he made the initiative to ask someone who would know and answer my questions!  That's the best way to learn and he get's an A+ for this effort!  I didn't get his name, but he was very nice and deserves this compliment.  

I had asked about these vegan protein balls they had displayed and I wanted to know what it was since I just wanted something small to satisfy my hunger until dinner.  My question was answered and I ordered one and I actually liked it!  Peanut butter is the base and it was packed with a bunch of stuff that actually went really well together (unknown what was in it) but there was definitely chia seeds! haha.  

I also ordered a dirty chai latte which was great!  You could taste the chai and I got the caffeine kick I wanted in that cup.  It was served pretty hot but perfect to hold in the NY cold weather in January.  

I'd come back to this place again!"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2016-12-16,4,I've been a customer of Gregory's for a year or so now and was pleased to hear they opened a store close to my apartment. This Gregory's had very trendy decor which was nice! It also was not too touristy or crowded for being in Times Square. I don't think the tourists have caught on yet ;).
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2016-12-15,1,Went todaywhat a cuppa coffee had to wait 10 minutes horrible coffee sour high-priced no service never going back
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2016-11-30,1,"$3.25 for a large regular coffee!!!  Stay away, much too expensive.  The coffee was watery and had no flavor.  Gave it a shot, but feel completely ripped off and unsatisfied.  Going back to Starbucks.  I almost tripped over the silly step in front and there is only room for one person to add sugar/milk to the tasteless coffee.  Yuck!"
167,gregorys-coffee-new-york-23,2016-11-29,5,"I'm the first?! Woohoo! But it's been here already a few weeks now. 

Solid espresso, lots of pastries even if I'm not a big fan of what I've tried so far. Odds are, you've already tried other locations so I don't need to convince you. 

Favorite coffee shop in the area, much better than Starbucks.  Too many Starbucks around here!!! Omg, every block has at least 1 or 2. Damn Times Square. :-(

Plus the app is really nice. I've gotten $5-6 for free with offers in the past month. You should definitely try the app. If you refer friends, you'll both get $2 right now I think."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2020-07-15,5,Amazing service!! Staff went above & beyond - went there for my iced latte during COViD and while I was on a run I had stepped on my mask so the employee asked if I wanted a new one & gave me a fresh clean mask! & my latte was made quickly & delicious
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2020-06-01,1,"I had an unfortunate experience here and because of covid-19 precautions it was honestly even worse. Ordered a nitro cold brew with salted cream cold foam. It tasted alright, lots of foam, until I noticed something wrong. I had gotten through most of the drink when I found a DIRTY BANDAGE at the bottom. This was disgusting and I immediately took it back to the store and said how unacceptable it was that this had happened. During quarantine I expected Starbucks employees handling drinks and food to be wearing gloves. I spoke to the store manager and later the district manager and was told that it is an option for workers to wear gloves but they are only required to wear face masks at this time. Was given $12 in service recovery cards which cannot be used for online orders. Seemed like an apathetic response to me. Was greatly disappointed. Only consolation was the woman whose bandage it was actually apologized and seemed genuinely sorry. Granted she had on a new bandage, was still not wearing gloves, and probably never wondered where the original bandage had gone until then..."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2020-03-05,2,"Terrible service - the barista was chatting with her friends to the point I had to prompt her through taking my order. I also had to ask three times for my coffee, with no apology for the inconvenience. Decent seating room and outlets but the place is cacophonous between the loud obnoxious music and the loud obnoxious behaviors of people in the shop. There is a man harassing customers who doesn't seem to have bought a drink, but the employees don't seem to care. Was hoping to find a single place to work remotely, but this is 100% not it."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2020-02-28,1,"Hi, this Starbucks does not ever give me my correct order, this morning I got an allergic reaction to the regular milk."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2020-02-21,1,"This Starbucks is actually a homeless shelter. It's hard to come here and enjoy a nice cup of coffee. The front of the store on 57th is unmonitored and anything goes. People are literally camping - sleeping on stacks of plastic shopping bags filled with junk. And drinking liquor out of paper bags. And begging for money IN THE STORE. I've regularly witnessed psychotic episodes - people shouting, talking to themselves, giggling uncontrollably, etc. Yesterday the police had to come and take away someone in an ambulance... Can you please re-tag this location as Manhattan Psychiatric Center? Because that's exactly what it is. Really disgusting."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2020-02-11,3,Noticed some improvement with customer service. Updated my ranking. Keep up good work.
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2019-11-11,2,"This is the worst Starbucks location I have been to. The workers play around behind the counter in front of you, and the place is a mess. The music blaring was also a surprise. The Department of Health should pay this location a visit."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2019-10-26,2,"Barista's attitudes are poor, and they work very slowly. You are met at the register by a miserable young worker, and followed by your food being placed wherever on any counter that's available with space. It is also very dirty and messy. Overall disappointing experience."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2019-09-26,3,"A decent amount of seating with plugs so you can get some work done. But yet again, the music is stupidly, headache-inducing loud. 

It's a shame because the staff is super fast and so friendly I'd like to come back. Instead I'm forced to find someplace quieter."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2019-09-03,1,"I really didn't think a Starbucks could be this bad. I mean, good for you that your location is so busy. But there are literally at least 30 people waiting for their orders and the place is filthy. No one is getting anything in less than 15 minutes. I cannot do this again and keep my job much longer. Oh well, better pay attention to this place. If your customers don't give up, the health board might close you down."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2019-08-18,1,"Horrible customer service, slow. People are more concerned with their personal conversations than taking care of the huge line and all the orders"
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2019-05-27,1,Good Starbucks but has problems. They will open at wrong times that are not posted. It's just a classic any old starbs but if you say you'll be open at 5 but doesn't open till 5:45 then that's bad. I am visiting New York (which I do frequently) and I stay at the same hotel every time. This starbs is the closest. So I frequently go there. I also have a frequent early morning meetings. I wish this place was reliable enough to like it more than I do. Good place. Nice employees. But there is obviously something happening underneath the franchise owners nose where the employees choose to open when they feel like it.
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2019-04-17,1,"This location has the potential to be good seeing how they have a lot of employees behind the bar but unfortunately each time I'm in here there's another problem with this place.

Its usually a bit dirty which could be due to how busy it usually is but still there's no excuse for a puddle of coffee in the middle of the store and a piss soaked bathroom. Take one of your many employees behind the bar fumbling over each other and have them clean the store a little more often.

Wait times here are also long regardless of how you order whether its mobile or on-line. I usually have to wait for 10+ minutes for my drink that usually costs a premium $5.

Another thing that I noticed with this location is the caliber of the people they hire. Miserable, unhappy, and should reconsider being baristas. Starbucks as a whole used to hire good people but lately not so much."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2019-03-07,2,"This location is always dirty and it seems like the baristas take way too long in making drinks.  I'm not a fan of this location at all and it's a shame considering how new it is.

This location needs some help and baristas who know what they're doing."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2019-03-04,1,"The music is so loud it sounds like there's a concert going on in here. We nicely asked the baristas to turn the volume of the speakers down and they did not do so, in fact it got louder. I'm not sure if they were doing this on purpose or not."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2019-01-08,1,"This use to be my go-to Starbucks. However, after giving this location a chance again and again, it just dissappointed me. Some of the baristas look as if they judge you or get annoyed when you are still deciding what you want to order. It doesn't seem like the baristas communicate with each other, thus creating incorrect orders or whos in charge of what (drinks/cashier/food). Some baristas aren't the friendliest either, which always made me feel so intimidated and judged. Will not return!"
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2018-07-24,1,"This Starbucks location was my favorite one so far but not anymore since yesterday...
I was so disgusted as soon as I walked in the restroom. LITERALLY AWFUL!!! Couldn't believe my eyes and I rushed to get out asap!
Never coming back, very much disappointed!"
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2018-04-25,4,"I like this location better than the nearby ones in Columbus Ave and Columbus Circle (Broadway). The service is fast so the lines are usually shorter. In any case, I always make sure to order through the app, that way I can just come in and pick up my order. Only downside is that if you come in later at night, sometimes they're out of certain things like the pastries or bantam bagels which I recommend. The staff is pretty nice about it though, one time they were out of a cake pop I wanted and the cashier gave me an extra one to compensate for it. 

Only docking one star because it could be a little cleaner - the floor and sugar/utensils counter is often messy."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2018-04-21,5,"I ordered the coffee which is always excellent but it was my first time trying their breakfast sandwiches. And let me just say it was absolutely delicious! Fresh and very tasty! Unlike other fufu joints around the area that are over priced and horrible !
Oh and by the way the service was outstanding!!!!"
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2018-03-06,5,"So usually a Starbucks is a Starbucks in general, however I have this one 5 stars (comparison only to other Starbucks cafes) due to couple of reasons. 

1- It is smack in the middle of Manhattan, only 2 minute walk from time square. Yet somehow, it is not overly crowded and seats were available on two occasions. Even the seats/leather-benches are comfortable and not what you would expect in a busy city. 

2- The workers are pleasant, polite and fast. Again, not your typical middle of Major city experience. 

People here are socializing, in and out, even working in their laptop. So obviously a good atmosphere to do whatever you want."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2017-12-15,1,"Terrible location, bathroom looked like Armageddon terrorized the locality. On top of that my order was made wrongly and the barista sneered at the idea of making it again despite the fact that I had allergies to it."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2017-10-29,1,"Really, Carlos? You didn't need to dump the entire ice coffee Trenta just because I wanted extra soy."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2017-09-14,5,Faster service than the location in Columbus circle. Ample seating and outlets to cater to post-class group meet ups and finals week cram sessions!
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2017-05-20,5,"This is a huge Starbucks location with plenty of seating. I love the look and feel of this spot. There are large windows that let in a lot of light, making it a bright and open place to lounge and sip on coffee. The staff was very friendly and the service was quick. This is definitely one of my favorite Starbucks in the area to visit. Since it is located in a residential area you get more of a laid back crowd which adds to the chill vibe. If you're in a hurry, order ahead on the mobile app to save time. Thank you Starbucks crew for the great service and coffee every time."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2017-02-01,4,"I really like this place! Don't know why it has many bad reviews. Maybe it depends on the days and if it's crowded or not, but I have been here during weekdays and during peak hours and I have been able to find a place to seat. 

I spent a good amount of hours doing some work and drinking coffee from morning to afternoon.

There are many good spots with outlets in each one so you can charge your phone or using your other devices while charging.

Service was fast and friendly."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2017-02-01,2,"Probably one of the worst Starbucks I've been to. The layout is such that you have to wait in a different area depending on whether you've ordered food (stand around by people who are waiting to order), drip coffee (stand around by the cash registers), or a specialty drink (in the regular pickup area).  The staff are completely unhelpful when it comes to directing you where to go. 

In the last week or so, they have run out of Pike Place, their standard medium roast drip coffee, during the morning rush -- not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES! Clearly this is an ongoing problem, and one might think to solve it by making MORE or perhaps monitoring the coffee situation more regularly ... but that might require too much critical thinking on the part of this crew.

There is a profound lack of communication all around -- staff to customer, staff to staff. Every visit takes about 10 minutes longer than it should and is decidedly unpleasant. They're lucky that none of the coffee shops in the immediate vicinity open until 7:00 or they would have a lot more competition."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2017-01-22,5,"Starbucks for me served directly in my Hotel in Times Square is a nice touch. Grabbing a steaming hot Venti Americano w/room and then climbing back into bed or wandering Times Square is very rewarding in my book. 

Hope having coffee here was an orgazmic experience for you as it was for me. Wink Wink"
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2016-12-04,5,"Wow the service here is perfect. So good that I actually bring myself to write a review. I am surprised to see so many negative comments but I think starbucks always change workers so my comment only reflects this time I visited. The cashier and barista are both very sweet, making sure they got the right order and ask if we want extra syrup (we - me and all other customers). I can tell that they love their job and nothing can get better than that in customer service! I hope these guys won't leave I would walk an extra avenue just for their warm service!"
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2016-11-11,3,"I almost did not stop here due to the reviews however while walking to a local establishment I realized I walked the wrong direction. (I'm just visiting NY)  After stopping to check my map, I realized I was standing in front of this Starbucks. 

No one jumped for joy when I walked in however there was a line to manage and the employees were taking care of business.  I will admit that the young lady behind the counter could have been more helpful with the woman struggling with her Apple Pay.....she did try to help.  My order and transaction were uneventful and the ""barista"" who helped was pleasant. 

By the way, the place was clean!! In fact when the line died down the staff came out from behind the counter to wipe down tables, etc. No complaints here."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2016-06-01,1,"The worst Starbucks experience EVER! The baristas in the back of the store are rude, disrespectful, lazy, & sloppy. Why would a barista, who deals with the public work with a scarf on her head instead of combing her hair before showing up for work. Clearly, it was not for religious purposes, just laziness. I will never patronize this establishment again. If I am spending on average, $6 or more on a cup of coffee. I can at least be greeted & waited on by a cordial employee who knows how to carry a conversation with the public without an attitude or being insulted because she is having a bad day. I would rather walk the short few blocks to the other Starbucks in the area."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2016-05-21,1,One of the worse Starbucks. They served 5 people who were after me before me because the barista felt like only making the ice drinks. Maybe she thought that lining up 2-3 clear cups and making each ice drink 1 at a time anyway was more efficient than making each hot/cold drink 1 at a time in order? Or maybe it was because she had just made 3 wrong hot drinks but only 1 wrong cold drink in the time I was waiting? Then 1 of the cashiers decided to help her. He was the one who rung up my 2 pump mocha. First thing he did? Pump 4-5x mocha into a cup then make my drink and hand it to me...so I can be sure that the pumps didn't match my 2 pump label. Why drink 1 cup of non-fat mocha when you can double your calorie intake with the same cup?
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2016-04-16,1,"My first exposure In a ""New York"" Starbucks. Wow these employees are not friendly at all. They got my drink size and order wrong. Did they fix things in the Starbucks way? No they said after getting it wrong they had to charge 33 cents more. At my home Starbucks they would have remade it immediately with a free drink as well. Then when I had a bunch of foam on top (which I asked for no foam) I said something and she said ""I took it off"" in fact she had not as I watched her make the drink. Lastly the extra hot I asked for was lukewarm. This was a horrible experience and not customer service in the spirit of the Starbucks franchise I am accustomed to in California. I will walk a little further to get my coffee tomorrow morning."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2016-03-12,1,"Terrible service the worst staff of any Starbucks I've been to . Awful customer service, rude, and dirty!"
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2016-01-29,1,"New year, new semester, new workers. It's not always a good thing though. Initial attitudes of the people today are not bad until they find out they keep messing up your drink. They give you the ""I've had enough of you"" treatment. It becomes your fault and not theirs (at least that's what it feels like) and I don't know how I feel about that...not good for sure.

I am assuming that they close at 8pm. I came here at 7:30 and already no one wanted to take my order and when they finally did, no one wanted to make it. If that's the case, why don't they just officially close and lock the doors? I don't get it.

Not to mention, it came with OD caramel...I know some people would be so happy but sorry, I'm not one of them. (Caramel macchiato)
My drink is OD sweet and I can't taste anything but sweetness. Not good."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-11-28,2,"Terrible service, there is lack of kindness and if you need something they don't look very happy for helping you, it's sad cause most of the Starbucks have very good service but these guys don't know what great customer service means.. change your staff, at least 80% of them"
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-11-16,2,The staff here doesn't give a flying fuck about customers. They're in a perpetual pissy mood. The two stars are for the girl who smiles before she takes the order.
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-11-16,1,"I trully feel that the AM shift needs to have a meeting on customer service at this Starbucks location. On several visits, the baristas were not at all happy taking orders or handing drinks/food items out. I feel so bothered that being a loyal customer w/ SB rewards to feel such service being received. I pay for my items and am not asking for anything free, yet it's been 3 times that I get such hostile inviduals to take my orders. I also observe the AM crew with other customers and also see how they don't try to cater to certain requests. Hope this review will help management reach out to the AM crew so that they know they haven't been putting a smile on their customers face. Extremely poor customer acknowledgement & service."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-11-11,4,"I come to this Starbucks location very regularly due to it's proximity to the west side and convenience to Columbus Circle [don't let my scarce check-ins fool you :-)] Overall I think this is a great Starbucks location and one of my favorites in the city.

I disagree with many people regarding the space in this location. I think it's huge for a NYC starbucks. It's better than many Sbux I've been to in Jersey. It's long and narrow, yes, but there are many seats near the entrance as well as bar seats along the window, and also another alcove near the restrooms in the back. I would estimate if every seat were filled, you can seat close to 30 people very comfortably. That is quite a few in my opinion, so you can accommodate the casual coffee consumer as well as the wi-fi squatter.

That leads into my next point: this is a great location to get work done or study. There are tons of outlets near the seats by the entrance and also a few near the bathrooms. Very well-placed near the small round tables so you should have no problem plugging in and getting some juice. During the summer the AC mounted above the entrance can be a nuisance as it activates every time someone comes in/out. Along the same lines, in the colder months it can be chilly sitting near the entrance, so keep your jacket on.....

Service: I will agree, up to a point, with other reviewers regarding the service. I have ordered using the starbucks mobile app and have had my drink ready for me when I walk in without any issues. I just walk to the pickup counter, ask for my drink, and then i'm done! I have had zero issues with the accuracy of the drinks. Likewise when I order a drink at the counter, i have always had the drinks done efficiently and accurately.

My main problem is when you order a food item AND a drink, the drink gets sent down the line and comes out in a timely fashion. However, the food item usually gets mentioned to someone, and hopefully they hear the first time. The microwaves are right behind the registers so you're awkwardly waiting for the food near the registers while they might be calling your name out at the far counter for your drink. This also causes congestion for people waiting in line for their order. They need to come up with a more organized/efficient way to handle the food orders. Also, I'll agree that sometimes the staff isn't very attentive, despite the fact they employ ample staff. But usually everyone is very friendly.

Overall the minor inefficiencies are easy enough for me to overlook, and I can enjoy an expensive latte in a spacious, well-powered space and do some work or studying."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-10-26,1,"The absolute worst. Unapologetic, sloppy staff. Long waits, mixed up orders, etcetera. 

The employees are too busy cracking jokes among one another and can't be bothered to do their own jobs."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-10-20,1,"I came in early in the morning to get my caffeine fix. I asked for a venti pike with two espresso shots. Right in front of me the barista poured me a venti dark roast. When I asked her if she had poured the two expresso shots she told me she did. Which was an obvious lie since I saw her pour it right in front of me. I'm pretty sure she wanted me to have the illusion of stronger coffee. I was not fooled nor amused. If I wanted a venti dark roast, I would have asked for a venti dark roast and I would not have shilled out the extra money for two espresso shots. Needless to say I just let it be and left, just so I can write a review here. This particular Starbucks will not get any more of my money."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-09-18,3,"This Starbucks isn't too big but it's right on a corner so it's convenient. Very little seating areas. Service was ok. Nice enough but they had given my breakfast sandwich order to someone else and they didn't have anymore. Granted it was late morning, around 11 am but they didn't have much left as far as something else to substitute the mix up."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-08-28,1,This is the worst Starbucks. Slow slow and slower! Laziest crew! They are just there for the paycheck. They all look busy but no one is actually doing anything productive. When they finally take your order you'll be lucky to get your order before the sun goes down. Horrible service!!! I would say in the last 6 months most Starbucks service has been on a steady decline. Go elsewhere!!!
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-08-25,1,"It sucked, poor customer service, usually busy, poor location, etc. I could go on forever..."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-06-29,2,"Probably the worst location I've ever been to. Surprisingly this location is almost always busy probably because it's in the center of several apartment buildings. 

I've been to this location about half a dozen times over the past month and they always make my drink wrong. I've complained to have my drink done over but they still continue to mess it up."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-06-26,2,"Cashier was rude and snapped at me, ""what would u like"" and when i hesitated for a few seconds to place my order she rolled her eyes when there was no need to b/c there wasn't anyone behind me. It wasnt a busy time and i wasn't holding anyone back but she was still rude and i felt rushed to make my order. :/ yet, i shouldnt expect much frm part-time workers and how theyre prob tired frm working long hrs but still :/"
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-05-16,3,"The newest Hell's Kitchen coffee-shop. It's not bad, but it's Starbucks, which means that although the coffee and pastries are good (even, by now, pretty standard), the running of the store is uneven. Flaws may be due to the newness of the place. But my long-standing experience with Starbucks could just as easily suggest that the things they do right are due to the newness of the place. Six months from now, it's just as easy to envision them being worth five stars or one star. It's an interesting commentary on the evolution of an American brand. CEO Howard Shultz still sees Starbucks as something special, something positive. He needs to get out more. Out in the field, it's obvious that bad local management, bad local persons selection, or overly stingy store budgets or some combination is already turning Starbucks into the Walmart of coffee. It's sad that I can already see this developing at this store, almost immediately after the opening. With Rex and FIKA just down the street, I seldom can make a case for coming here; except possibly for the after 9 PM exacter hour its open on most nights -- assuming the employees don't start mopping and putting chairs up early."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-05-13,3,I felt it's a bit slow considering how many people they have on staff. But there is a lot of available seating and electronical outlets. It's a very roomy starbucks if you want to study or sit a relax before the morning rush.
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-04-07,2,The first week they were open they were already running out of ingredients. The staff can be very distracted then expects you to pay for their mistakes. That little sign that says they will fix it if they don't make it right seems to be a lie there.
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-03-31,2,"Grateful that this starbucks is on 10th so there is some convenience closer to the West End, however, the staff here is VERY hit or miss with beverages. And there are usually FIVE or SIX people working and only ONE person ringing up and ONE person making the drinks while the others piddle around and do whatever. 
 
What is great is all of the seating- however, 30% of the people in there usually have food/coffee from other places/ loitering high school students from around the corner and they're taking up seating for customers who are actually purchasing FROM Starbucks. Is there no employee to police this policy? 

Again, great that they're in the neighborhood but it runs like an amateur coffee shop, not like a Starbucks . I hope the staff can get it together because twice I've witnessed people walk out because of the slow service and long lines. At least if this continues, there is Rex around the corner and FIKA too."
168,starbucks-new-york-433,2015-03-09,5,"Great new addition to the neighborhood! Friendly staff, great beverage quality.

Opens early which is a big plus.

Very spacious with lots of sitting space and outlets."
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2019-10-14,5,"I haven't been super impressed with the Starbucks in the area but this one was surprisingly nice! I was greeted upon getting into the line and asked if I had any questions. I had a discount that wasn't processing correctly through the computer and the cashier was very patient and friendly. I don't remember her name but it started with an E and she had a great smile. My drinks came out quickly and correctly and everything was very clean behind the bar. Zobey was making drinks and connecting with other guests, and was very sweet handing out my order. Very happy with this location where I haven't been in nearby stores"
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2019-01-23,4,"Since I work in the building, this Starbucks is definitely the most convenient place to get coffee (especially if it's cold outside). My experiences have definitely been hit or miss so probably would give this location 3.5 stars. 

Pros
(+) Efficiency: Both due to the location and the overall efficiency of the staff, I'm usually able to grab my drink pretty quickly
(+) Corporate customer service: When I've complained on their website about any negative experiences, the company reviewed the feedback and refunded the drink. I appreciate that as a whole, the company does pay attention to potential areas of improvement

Cons
(-) Inconsistency of drinks and staff: I think the staff that have been there for a while are great, but there are occasionally some hiccups in the service. It's understandable since it seems like they're often training new employees"
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2018-06-29,1,"Horrible service from an older woman she wears black glasses and she had a gray hat on. I went in after work to get a chocolate croissant and an ice tea. I asked for there dragon fruit ice tea and was told there was no more.. so I asked for a strawberry açaí and that was also ""no more"" .. so I asked okay so what do you have? She said ""just very berry"" so I ordered that.. then I asked for a chocolate croissant she repeated it and I said ""yes warmed up"" when I said that I was told there was no more and that they were closing soon. I completely understand that as A food establishment you condense as the day ends but for me to be honest I found this situation ridiculous. Also the croissants were displayed if you have ""no more"" then please don't display them as if they are there to be sold. Not to mention this lady didn't even transact my order with a smile she seem to be irritated, she was also dealing with two young ladies who were having issues with a barcode. In a nutshell, I feel like the situation could have been handled a little better so the customer can feel a little better. I must insist that I completely understand how it is when the day ends but it's all about approach I just wanted a simple order... a smile could have gone a long way since sadly there was nothing you could have really ordered since they were ""about to close""."
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2018-03-05,1,"Most unfriendly staff. I would slightly understand if it was early in the morning and I am use to the Starbucks in California but, 11:52 customers are not being greeted. They are not being asked how can they help. Just a cold place. Probably the most unwelcoming Starbucks I have been to."
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2016-10-20,1,"Horrible service.  I asked for a blonde coffee, I get this every day and know what it tastes like.  They gave me a cup and I immediately knew it was bold.  I complained, they ignored my complaint.  Starbucks' policy is to redo drinks when they are not right.  They refused to redo it.  I asked for a refund and the woman at the register rolled her eyes and gave me an attitude, as if the refund would personally hurt her feelings.  Some of the worse service I've ever seen at a Starbucks.  The seating area is great, but this Starbucks has terrible drinks and terrible service.

I wish Howard Schultz could make a surprise visit to this venue and be mistreated by these employees.  He'd close this place down once forced to ingest some of the worst coffee ever brewed."
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2015-12-08,1,The staff here is downright moronic. More concerned about chatting than working. Maybe pay a modicum of attention to your customers you jerks. All you dummies raving about the waterfall and the piano are out of your minds. The worst!
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2015-10-13,3,"They were restructuring this place about half a year ago and now it is at the opposite side of the building. Nothing really changed since then, only the number of seats were reduced...because of this fact, the Christmas decoration was no longer there...I missed their teddy bear collection a lot and wish they could just bring it back! Anyway lines were usually particularly long during afternoon time, so spare extra time on that."
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2014-05-06,3,"This one Starbucks seems to be listed three times in Yelp. It is at the bottom of Park Avenue Plaza, right next to a huge waterfall. I used to work in the building and came here at least twice a day for two years. 

The staff are really nice, they remembered me and my coffee order every single time. So, the place gets three stars for the staff. However, the setting is a bit like being in a huge shopping mall - very exposed, not cosy at all. Plus, the waterfall can have an uncomfortable affect on your bladder..."
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2014-02-11,1,"this will clearly be my last visit to this location.  they somehow managed to screw up a cup of brewed coffee!!!  not a skinny, soy, frappy- whatever, whatever.  the thing tasted foul.  either the milk that I added at their counter was mislabeled or they put something in the coffee (almost tasted like sugar).

you stole my $2.50, man!"
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2013-03-10,4,This Starbucks is very pleasant and relaxing to grab a cup of coffee as the setting is unlike many other Starbucks.  It's located in the atrium with a piano and a waterfall.  Service has been good every time I have been here and it's much better than the one in Sony Plaza.
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2011-10-23,3,"Store #9241 sits inside BlackRock Park Avenue Plaza open atrium against the indoor waterfall.  This small Starbucks does not have the equipment to heat sandwiches as my Roma Tomato and Mozzarella sandwich at $5.55 was stone cold.  Staff is cordial and honest as they alerted me of the would-be taste if heated.

Seating is somewhat ample in this open atrium but do not be disappointed for no availability during peak lunch hours.  Two small unfathomably feces of facilities are located in the middle of BlackRock Park Avenue Plaza."
169,starbucks-new-york-494,2010-11-11,5,"live piano water fall, a lot of tables, very good place for lunch"
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2020-07-08,5,"Fresh delicious ready to eat sandwiches,baguettes, salad,cold wrap and croissants. I love ice chai latte from this location. Chocolate chunk cookie is baked so fresh and soft. Pret A Manger have many locations in the heart of Manhattan reminds me when I was back in London and it was a Pret A Manger on every single block."
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2020-02-28,4,"Pret was always a favorite coffee/tea spot of mine when I lived in NYC. This one was very clean despite the high traffic and after ordering my Peppermint tea and purchasing, I was able to find a neat and tidy table to relax during the morning rush. 

All the food including fruit and sandwiches looked amazingly fresh and after trying the ""Winter Fruit"" cup (blood orange, grapefruit, naval orange) I must say that it was delicious and refreshing. 

I love coming into Manhattan just to experience city living whenever I visit my family still here. Pret is a great reminder on how convenient everything is here in NYC and how much effort is put into creating a quality morning experience despite how crowded my beloved city is.  I'm so happy I was able to patron them again."
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2020-02-18,4,"Pret! I am quite familiar with this chain as it has been a staple for me while I travel through the UK. It has always been a great place to grab a quality pastry, sandwich or coffee for take-away or sit-in. It is like a Starbucks but better! When I am on the other side of the pond, I will walk into Pret before I walk into a Starbucks. 

On my visit to this location, I grabbed a Salmon salad, a chicken soup and tea for a quick bite. For what it was, a prepared meal in a box, the quality was very good. The café itself is clean and organized with different food options from sandwiches to salads. The staff here are very friendly and helpful as well. 

It is just nice to have a Pret on our side of the pond!"
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2019-10-08,5,"The staff here is very accommodating. I like most of the food at Pret. I purchased something this morning that I wasn't wild about. I took a few bites and went up to the counter with it. I kindly asked if I could exchange it for a coffee. I showed that I barely ate any of it. The staff quickly said yes. I am very appreciative for the consideration. Pret on Broadway has outdoor seating. They have WiFi. They have self-service coffee, which I like. They also have self-service sandwiches.  Grab and go."
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2019-06-01,1,"I tried to leave this post privately on their website customer service email but it wasn't letting me submit so here you go world. 

Hi, I frequent the Pret on 56th and Broadway in NYC, probably three to four times a week. Usually the staff is beyond friendly and kind. Unfortunately today the two men behind the counter were less than so. I understand they were short staffed, or appeared to be overwhelmed by the handful of customers. I ordered a large iced coffee, the gentlemen who was preparing the coffees was clearly distracted by his co-worker informing him he was only scheduled to work until 1pm (it was 12:38pm). He prepared me a small coffee that took about 4 minutes for him to get to get her. I let him know I ordered a large iced coffee and I watched him pour the small iced coffee in a large cup and then use his hands to add more ice...1) that's disgusting 2) just adding ice is not how you make a small coffee large. I'm honestly so disgusted I can't return to this location."
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2019-05-10,1,The food at Pret is decent to really good but the people that work here are another story. They have terrible attitudes and talk back to you in a very disrespectful way and continuously roll their eyes. I work right around the corner and so I visit this location fairly often. If I was their manager I would fire them all and to think that minimum wage just increased to $15 to do their job!
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2019-05-08,5,"I wanted to say this restaurant is always my favorite in the area. The team always goes beyond to ensure I am satisfied.  They do a wonderful job to ensure the food is fresh and hot. I am particularly impressed with Angie who always has a wonderful attitude and knows my order. Look forward to coming back soon!

Rochelle"
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2019-03-25,1,"THIS DESERVES A NEGATIVE-*!! I have never been a patron of this franchise because the options were limited.  However, today I wanted to check out the juices offered, and NOT to my surprise the juice was NOT fresh and the options were limited. I physically picked up two small bottles of green juice, read the ingredients, which included a fruit that I am allergic to, I PUT THEM BACK DOWN, and I then looked over the selection of other items in the refrigerated case, none of which I wanted, I then quickly left. WHY DID AN EMPLOYEE FOLLOW ME OUTSIDE AND LOUDLY ACCUSE ME OF STEALING!! ""HE SAW ME PUT A JUICE IN MY PURSE"", is what he said, to me AFTER HE SCREAMED ""AM I GOING TO PAY FOR THE JUICE??? While I was damn near to the corner!!!  MAD AS HELL IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!! The funny thing about this incident, I was with my LAWYER, who was rushing to get to the airport!! Contacting corporate ASAP!!!"
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2019-02-16,1,Is this a joke? I order a small cup and look how much ice the guy puts in my cup. I was actually watching how he did it. He took a long time filling the cup with ice and then later he try closing the cup to measure how much ice he can pack in the small size cup. Then he turn around to check if I was watching and he knew I was watching so he end up having his back covering how he filled my drink. You pretty much know what happens next. Unprofessional and worse service ever! Never coming back to this specific location.
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2019-01-06,1,"worst pret. stopped by this morning and even though there was absolutely no customers at the register and at least 3 staff members there, It took several good morning to get acknowledged (no good morning back of course except for one guy) and have the girls there stop their little chat and stop staring at their cell phone. the girl who got my order could barely put her cell phone down (not even sure she actually did), and looked annoyed even borderline angry. no good morning no thank you nothing. on top of that the place is not very clean for a pret. 
save yourself bad morning vibes and go to le pain quotidien instead."
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2019-01-04,2,"I work across the street and have been coming to this Pret since they first opened in 2018. Things started off great here. There was a surplus of options and the customer service was on point. But over the past 2-3 months, things have been going downhill. And fast. 

There is never any coffee available in the morning (except for decaf, but what's the point?) and I am usually there by 8:15am. Customers are constantly asking the staff for coffee or milk (the canisters on the counter run empty and stay that way unless addressed), and the employees seem offended to be reminded of their daily tasks.

Besides that, they have 1-2 options of soup a day--their online menu lists at least 5--and their breads are often burnt. The other day, I visited during the weekday lunch hours and there was literally nothing to chose from. They had one salad option and maybe two sandwich choices; the rest of the food displays were completely empty. Potential customers were entering the store, staring at the empty shelves in shock, and walking away. 

I wish this place would get its act together, as Pret is a great, quick, healthy option and close to my work. 

PS: I've worked at Panera Bread in my high school and college years, so I know how these places should operate. This is NOT it."
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2018-12-27,1,The cashier was very rude and pushy. No offer for heating bagel? Will not come back. The place is cold too.
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2018-10-03,1,Horrible!!!!! It could be because it was 6:30am but would have been way better off with a street coffee and a donut. Chai latte was undrinkable and husband had large coffee and ended up with grounds in his mouth. Waste of 8 bucks and customer service non existent. No options out in prepared food. If your open for breakfast shouldn't it be available. Skip it!!!!
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2018-09-03,4,"First stop for breakfast in NYC, we have a small baby, only negativ they don't offer high chairs baby had fun though.. music abit loud for my taste in the morning but my baby liked it. 
We tried the grilled cheese sandwich n the egg n beans hot wrap, both were tasty, for our 18 minth old she enjoyed her yogurt with berries.
Prices reasonable i guess. Costed us about 21 $ for everything with coffees. Personal were okay too not rude just neutral. Would come again:)"
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2018-08-14,5,"I stop by here on my way to work every morning for an iced coffee. Because of the location, it has its fair share of tourists coming through, but that doesn't stop the staff from being friendly and amazing!"
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2018-05-12,5,"Had a great avocado spicy chicken wrap here and the staff was really friendly. I like how all the ingredients are always fresh every time I come. It has great nutritions I need for my day. I LOVE LOVE LOVE to start my day with their organic wraps and sandwiches. It's definitely guilty free and healthy! 
There's no Pret A Manager around where I live but I wouldn't mind going out early to get some goodness before work and school."
170,pret-a-manger-new-york-87,2018-04-05,5,"I became a fan of Pret A Manager last summer when I bite into one of their yummy croissants then my friend Andrea recommended these sandwiches that you take to the cashier for them to toast it. I love their Ham & Cheddar one and I think they used different sizes of the bread.

Good luck trying to find a seat because it was hella packed today!"
171,bistro-new-york-international-new-york-5,2009-07-29,4,"This place is your pretty standard midtown deli but for two exceptions.

The salad bar is well done with all the ingredients looking fresh. None of those wilted / weathered greens that you normally find at almost any other place. They have a fairly big selection of toppings and dressings especially given the fact there are other deli's in the neighborhood with larger footprints that seem to stock less.

The other major exception is check out that terriyaki salmon! It's probably the first place I've seen where they have the entire cooked fish (more than one actually) right up on the counter for you to pick your piece from.

Not only is this impressive visually, but in all honesty when it's sitting under the heat lamps as one giant fish it's less prone to dry out and be nasty like the individual filets you'll find elsewhere.

Prices are just as comparable as any place else and the entrance being tucked on 40th seem to cause this place to be relatively quiet making for a quick in and out.

Bonus points for the sign that says ""Clean Restroom"", I didn't check it out, but hey it might make for a cleaner experience than popping into the closest Starbucks next time nature calls in this area."
171,bistro-new-york-international-new-york-5,2009-03-02,4,"I think I come to this eatery about 3-4 times a week and I'm never particularly excited about it. I think that's mostly because I have been here just so many times and I've tried almost everything. 

The set up is pretty standard for a midtown lunch place. They have a hot and cold buffet ($6-7/per pound), deli section ($6-8/per sandwich), soup section ($6 for Udon soup), salad bar ($8 unlimited toppings), sushi ($5+) and drinks, yogurts, and other small snacks. 

The salad is by far the best and most delicious deal as it's made right in front of you and you get to put in as many toppings into it as you like. There is also a selection of 10-15 different dressings (including 5+ low fat/ low carb options). 

I also am a fan of the deli section as all cold cuts are boars head and they have some nice bread options. The sushi is generally not extremely impressive in variety but always fresh. They usually have at least the Rainbow or the Dragon roll for those seeking a special rolls. 

The hot / cold buffet looks pretty fresh but in my opinion the options are a bit limiting. I usually don't get anything from there as the food looks pretty greasy."
172,dunkin-new-york-87,2019-11-27,3,I'm torn because the manager and some of the guys are working so hard to provide excellent service and some if the staff can't care less so it's a very inconsistent experience.
172,dunkin-new-york-87,2019-10-10,5,I love this place. Richard couldn't have been better. He gave us A+ service and he was super nice. We came from San Diego and we couldn't have felt more welcomed. Thank you Richard. Give the man a raise
172,dunkin-new-york-87,2019-08-01,1,"this dunkin is maybe fifty steps from my front door so i was patient, but it's been open for a long time now so i'm done making excuses, the service is very very very bad, i feel like i come home with a story every time i go in, today's story: i order a hot coffee with cream and sugar (this must be one of the most common orders at dunkins nationwide), i stand in the pickup area waiting for a while (more than 5 mins but less than 10 mins) considering the simplicity of my order, finally my number is called and i pick up my coffee, the sticker on the side says cream and sugar and the size is correct, all seems right with the world, i get home a few moments later and calmly think that today's experience wasn't that bad and that i'll go back tomorrow, then i turn on ny1, sit down on the couch, and take a sip of my black coffee..."
172,dunkin-new-york-87,2019-07-16,1,"Never had a problem with any Dunkin' Donuts but I'm leaving work and driving so obviously I need coffee to wake me up! I go inside the guy cashier tells me they are closed meanwhile it a 24hr Dunkin' Donuts meaning you serve the customers 24hrs! He tells me they close when they want to and choose their customers. What got me furious was they let 3 sanitation workers go in and get coffee. I confronted him and he said they picking their garbage but when I looked there was no more garbage. After 30 seconds of me telling him they can't pick and choose their customers he finally said just go inside and get your coffee. After I told him I wanted the managers name he spoke politely and even said ""thank you"". I should be the one saying thank you for making me an iced coffee when I needed it. I choose not to mention their names because I don't want anyone getting in trouble but no employee gets to choose their customers or when they close and open for an ""audit"" as he stated."
172,dunkin-new-york-87,2019-06-08,5,This Dunkin is one of my favorites. The staff is great. No matter the time they always greet with a smile. This is one of their newer locations. And I must say...BRAVO Dunkin'. Well done. If you are in this area and need a pick me up this is the place to go. NY definitely runs on Dunkin. I want to give a big shout out to Ralph. His customer service is exceptional. I recommend to anyone who visits this location to ask for him. Always great service. If I am ever in the area this is my go to place.
172,dunkin-new-york-87,2019-06-04,4,"Dunkin is my favorite coffee place and this location lived up to my standards. The only thing they got wrong was when they were really busy they didn't hear part of my order, thus leaving out a drink. It turned out to not be that deep, but a little inconvenient."
172,dunkin-new-york-87,2019-03-05,2,"Such a great and convenient location but horribly slow, frequently wrong orders. I've become accustomed to repeating my (very simple) coffee order 3-4 times and then carefully watching to make sure it's inputted correctly. I'm also not a fan of the ear-piercing alert tone that goes off every few seconds from the equipment.

Leave yourself extra time, especially if you want food."
172,dunkin-new-york-87,2019-03-02,1,"There was some weird guy flirting with the barista while she was working and not only was he totally distracting to her, holding up the line, but also incredibly invasive to patrons. I genuinely thought they were doing a bit. I then had to wait 10 minutes for her to fill my order because she was socializing even after he left and when she asked why I was still there and I reminded her she was like ""I charged you for that?"" Managers take a look at your staff and train them better"
172,dunkin-new-york-87,2019-02-15,5,"Great location for me as I work around the block. It's also near several broadway shows so probably very convenient for tourists. The store was very clean and service was fast. They had a line out the door around 3p but were good about moving it along. 

I usually go for the hot drinks - their drip coffee is always good, as are their espresso based drinks (lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos). You can definitely taste the difference with their new espresso and I find it much smoother. I personally love the hazelnut swirl macchiato (small size has two espresso shots FYI), but more recently I've been getting their lattes/cappuccinos since they're $2 from 2p-6p! Can't go wrong with Dunkin'!"
172,dunkin-new-york-87,2018-10-22,5,This was a very nice and very quick experience! Just what I needed since I parked illegally. Needed to get a cup of coffee in order to keep awake from Manhattan to Westchester! The coffee was so good (and so strong) that I was up well into the morning!! All the of the employees were wonderful and efficient for a Tuesday evening at 7:08PM! Thanks Dache B. and the rest!!
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2019-10-16,5,Came in on a rainy day felt feeling like a ball of sunshine. Who doesn't like a medium latte with donuts! Thanks crew for turning my upside smile right side up!
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2019-08-21,1,This place seriously needs help there's is zero customer service the cashier don't know much and the ppl making the food and drinks don't pay attention to the order so tired of this place time to say goodbye
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2018-12-25,1,"""Merry Christmas, thank you"" then proceeds to put my change in her own tip mug. This is unacceptable behavior and rather disgusting. Tip is earned and not forced. I will be contacting a district manager so that the employees here can receive corrective instructions."
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2018-09-16,2,"There are better Dunkin' Donuts out there. The iced coffee I got had all of the sugar on the bottom, so all I tasted was watered down coffee and a bunch of sugar at the end. If you stick your straw all the way to the bottom then you'll just taste sugar. The trick is to wait and let it dissolve, but this took a while for it to taste good. Other Dunkin' Donuts I've been to haven't had this issue."
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2017-12-02,5,Although the coffee and donuts taste as bad as other Duncan locations I love any place in Time Sq! **Time square #1 in my heart forever!
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2017-02-16,1,Used to like this location but will not go back again. Really disappointed in the customer service I received today. Will definitely be taking my business to the other two closer to my job now.
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2016-12-24,2,"Customer service needs improvement. Staff also needs to work on being more efficient. A guy in front of me waited a little too long for a bagel. Also, the employee didn't know what donut another customer was asking for. The customer had to point it out to him and tell him which row and side the donut was on. The hot chocolate was pretty good but I spent way too much time waiting to get it as the line moved slowly."
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2016-10-06,5,Enjoy this location for its quick service and lots of cashiers.  I also enjoy that its right off the M train so in a pinch you can always grab a coffee.  I realize that alot of people dont like the abrasive quickness in service sometimes but trust me.. quick in NY is better than slow.
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2015-09-15,1,Gross 1 of 3 immature Indian boys dropped a hot order on the floor being spiteful and served it to a customer while they weren't looking. If you ate from here it's like literally eating off the floor. Also seen discrimination against other members of the LGBT community where they laugh and mock like little children. Can't believe managment sees such behavior and says nothing about it. Guess you can eat here vs eating off one of the trash bins in the streets if it were your only two options. Personally.. I would rather starve. Makes me sick thinking about the countless of times this has been going on.  Rating them a 1 star is being way to nice.
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2015-04-07,1,Didn't notice cashier gave us 11 instead of a dozen...pay attention when choosing your donuts.
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2015-03-10,4,Very fast workers and nice atmosphere! Perfect for a quick bite and coffee in the morning.
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2014-11-21,1,Very slow service. Cashiers will serve their regulars before anyone else. Watched a server pat down the trash with gloves on and then continued making coffees with the same gloves. Bagel lady doesn't know how to toast bagels they are either burnt or barely toasted and puts way too much cream cheese or too little. Is it that hard? I order the same thing Everytime I go and they charge me differently Everytime. Coffee cups are always sloppy with the coffee all over it so you have to wipe it in front of them but they still don't care even after giving them dirty looks.
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2014-09-26,4,"Small store on 48th, a block off Broadway. Both times here, the customer service was excellent. Friendly fun people. Typical Dunkin Donuts fare..
Had a breakfast sandwich, hash browns and coffee. All good, really good. Give excellent marks for their coffee. Great flavor. I am kinda Starbucks guy but found myself here this morning for the coffee."
173,dunkin-new-york-82,2013-05-20,4,"I was on my way to go get lunch today and noticed that a new DD opened up closer to my office. Personally, I love this. The other closest one is on 50th just across B-way but it makes me late for work. This one is diagonal from the M & M store. It's much smaller than your average DD but I had no problems with service or my order."
174,dunkin-new-york-157,2017-08-01,3,this hidden dd in the basement area of the grand central terminal passageway that leads to madison ave. it's purpose is for folks heading or leaving grand central is grab a donut and coffee and keep it moving . the full array of a typical dd but it's small inside especially if more then 8 folks are inside . i picked up a dozen donuts for the work place and at first the girl behind the counter had trouble putting in the 9.99 coupon for a dozen donuts but girl worker number 2 came out and sealed the deal . i am glad that i was in and out quickly cause it's hot inside especially when you have a bunch of stranger huddled so close together . this place is set up position wise for the metro north commuters and others going thru the passageway but next time i rather be above ground .
174,dunkin-new-york-157,2017-06-08,1,"This used to be a very good dunkin with fresh coffee all the time (and not just during rush hour). But the last month, things have gone down hill quickly. New staff perhaps. Coffee is consistently burnt - as if sitting on warmer for way too long. When you ask staff for fresh cup, they laugh and snicker as they pour from another pot - and even that is usually burnt"
174,dunkin-new-york-157,2016-12-24,2,"This DD is conveniently located in the passage way from Grand Central to Madison Ave. I stop in most morning, the store is super small and always crowded. The staff is fast and friendly. They tend to always seem to be rushing, but what choice do they have in a major NYC train terminal, with very few mistakes. They need to come up with a better delivery system to help get the food and coffee from the counter to the customer."
174,dunkin-new-york-157,2015-10-13,3,It's convenient but not the most ideal DD to visit. They always seem to be in a rush when taking your order so I've had mine messed up a few times. Since it is not advertised greatly it does make for a nice surprise when leaving grand central terminal.
174,dunkin-new-york-157,2015-06-10,2,"This is a Dunkin Donut i frequent daily as I am walking out of Grand Central Station. It is located in the 45th Street Passage. Unfortunately, the staff is such in a rush even when it is not busy that they are not receptive of your order. As a result, the item you order is rarely done right. You ask for skim milk in your coffee, guess what they are putting in cream. You want Vanilla Flavor shot, guess what they are putting in the sugary swirl. Today I was in the process of ordering my coffee, I did not even  finish ordering  and the gentlemen in the back hands me my coffee. I only got through telling the cashier i needed skim milk, I still did not explain I wanted 2 splendas and a turbo shot. She then responds to me ""You have to tell me this before"". I respond by saying "" I didn't even finish placing my order and he simply hands me a coffee"". The cashier takes back that coffee and puts in a turbo shot and hands it back.... Guess what the only thing that coffee had right was the Turbo Shot... There was long line and I did not want to continue to hold up the rush. 

Staff should be educated and trained on how to work together efficiently and utilize communication skills..."
174,dunkin-new-york-157,2014-10-20,4,This is the cheapest Dunkin in all NY compare their ice tea prices to any other in their franchise its nearly half the price without a coupon for an ice tea. Every morning as I walk into my work building and order breakfast here the staff is extremely kind and understanding. This place is located in the basement that connects the grand central terminal to the NYC MTA building. On a side note they also accept the Dunkin discount card I have been to several in NY which have not accepted it.
174,dunkin-new-york-157,2014-08-01,3,"This isn't actually advertised well, it's in one of those little corridors to Grand Central that pops up.

The doorway has a separate sign standing outside when it's open (only reason I knew to go in there), down the stairs and past the shoe repair store to get to it.

Cramped, a bit warm, and busy. Small enough to fit maybe a dozen people inside at a time, but stocked with everything in a regular Dunkin, just crammed in.  Service was slow... but it was convenient, and cheap compared to the overpriced options in Grand Central."
174,dunkin-new-york-157,2012-08-31,3,"Very convenient location for me - This is the only reason why I go here often.  I enjoy their iced coffee, even though it's almost $3.00 for a medium."
175,cafe-la-cerra-new-york-2,2020-07-14,5,"SUPER cute coffee shop, really sweet staff. haven't had an oat milk latté for this good of a price in nyc in awhile, highly recommend you stop in"
175,cafe-la-cerra-new-york-2,2020-04-08,5,"This cafe/pizza shop is only a few months old.  It's clean, simple, and lovely. The pizza is fantastic and so is the coffee! Once things are back to normal I'm sure it will be even more inviting. Try the GF cauliflower crust-it's yummy. Staff, especially the gentleman in charge at night, is especially friendly."
175,cafe-la-cerra-new-york-2,2020-03-28,4,"a nice place on 1st ave and 50th st to grab some an espresso, pastries , salads , smoothies , waffles , pannini wraps, etc. on the right side area which is separated by a white curtain sells pizza and more.  with the country in a semi lockdown i am only able to take my cappy and muffin on the run which is ok cause its a ghost town on 1st ave and the dog park is empty nearby . the same girl made my hot beverage during my last two visits and gal knows how to work the italian coffee machine cause my decaff cappy is excellent and muffin aint bad either . nice simple place to grab some coffee and healthy snacks along with the sweet stuff i prefer and as soon as folks can sit in i will be one of them . p.s. the margarita pizza is very good ."

176,starbucks-new-york-531,2020-01-16,2,"This review is based on the coffee, not the customer service. Coffee here is a hit or miss but today I had the worst coffee. I ordered a flat white. It looked like leftover latte that was already stirred without any foam and it was lukewarm."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2019-07-23,1,"Terrible customer service unlike many other Starbucks locations in this area. Not returning to this location, just walk a block or two for different locations around for the coffee"
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2019-07-19,1,"We all know that feeling when you are getting tired when you walk hours in the city and you stop by for a coffee to fill up yourself with caffeine. So we stopped by here to grab a coffee and hit the restroom. The line was so long, because they were short with staff and even the staff who work there they were rude and slow. So finally we got the coffee to go and I visited the restroom, or I tried to visit it, but it was seriously disgusting!"
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2019-07-12,1,"I work in the building and decided to order egg white bites. I was the only person in there at 740am. I ordered and paid at the register. After 15min of people coming in and ordering and leaving, I'm still standing there politely, patiently waiting. Once I saw the same cashier serving out 3 orders of egg white bites to other customers that just got there, I went up and asked her if she had my order. She was blank in the face and asked me if I placed a mobile order. WTF?!! You just took my order!!! I just cancelled my order and left. Unbelievable. I waited 20min to not have egg white bites. 

The gentleman preparing and serving coffees was on point tho. He was mad for me because he was also checking in on my order. Once he saw the cashier messed up he gave me a gift card for the ridiculous service. I wish I could give negative stars. Don't bother with this location SMH"
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2019-07-02,1,"15 minutes wait for a regular cup of coffee via mobile ordering, which usually says 3-6 minutes wait. Starbucks mobile ordering system has allowed this corporation to take in massive amounts of orders at the expense of their customers time... If the line was long, you'd walk out, but mobile ordering deceives you and makes you wait. Think about how much you make per hour and divide it by 4... that's how much extra you are paying with your time and and lost productivity"
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2019-06-04,1,"Horrible customer service. Drinks are never ready on time. The mobile app would say your drink is ready but when you go to pick it up the order is not ready yet. I always have to let pass a least one hour to make sure I don't wait for too long in the store. 

Today was the worst of all days. My grande latte had no even half of the liquid it supposed to have and it didn't taste like coffee at all. 

When customer try to speak to the personal they just reply in an unnecessary rude way."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2018-06-24,1,"If I could give this place negative stars I would! 
My husband was a paying customer toady and they refused to let him use their restroom!"
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2017-09-23,5,Always a great experience line moves quickly in the morning and staff is friendly. One of the only Starbucks where the cashier will make your iced coffee instead of waiting in line with all the people ordering fancy drinks. My go to location every morning.
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2017-05-31,5,"I work in the building and see these people on many mornings. Very efficient and friendly. They all seem to be on good terms with each other, and they treat customers well. I especially like Sharon. Her hat and accent cheer me up every day I come in.

Yes, you will be hustled through this place. This is an office building Starbucks. People need to get through the line and back up to work. Lollygagging isn't really tolerated."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2017-05-12,1,"Why do people come here? All tourists and morons. Sorry, but if anyone shows up with a Starbucks in their hand, I think they are a moron. 

Why did I come here? Because 'Know your enemy' and half-priced frappucino happy hour. I remember my first frapp. It was so big and fluffy. It was easy. Cold and sweet. This was before I drank coffee so this was an entrance of sorts, but it was nothing like actual coffee as I drink now.

On this date, with my smores frappucino, the concoction was sort-of fun, sweet, and my head was not animated from caffeine but from sugar. And that's not what I want at all. Starbucks is for children."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2017-01-05,3,"OK - I have no patience (like the rest of NYK'ers) but this location seems to move faster than the Rockefeller Ctr concourse location.  Especially if you do the mobile order - your drink(s) is usually almost there waiting for you upon your arrival... I've tried both: 

-Order in person - approximately 10 mins wait
-Mobile order - less than 5 mins (2x it's been waiting for me).

I think it also depends on what you ordered - specialty drinks & fraps- add 2 mins... regular coffee - no wait at all.

Overall, the Starbucks team here is pretty good & efficient. 

I'm also biased bc it's right next to my work... ;)

Happy Java hunting!"
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2016-08-10,1,Extremely slow and rude service. Was yelled at by the cashier for pointing out a mistake with my drink after he asked me to repeat the (simple) order 3 times. The original drink was thrown out before I could say anything otherwise and the replacement was just milk with syrup at the bottom.
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2016-04-23,2,"I will admit that I generally like Starbucks.  But this particular Starbucks is just infuriatingly slow.  This store is in the same building as my office, so it SHOULD be the most convenient.  For some reason, there's just a lack of efficiency and energy and interest in doing a good job."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2014-08-18,4,Regular coffee place for a typical weekday morning. The line for coffee gets really long between 8 and 9 am but the employee will offer samples of breakfast for those in line. That's pretty nice of them. . there are decent number of seats here in additional to a bath room
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2014-04-14,2,"one of the slowest and most inefficient Starbucks locations in the area. would be nice if it wasn't the one attached to my office building ;(

gimme my caffeine drank right the first time, not the third... please?

also, the milk/sugar bar is always a mess, the baristas give you attitude if you request a refill of the milk when it's empty, and they are alwaysss out of stoppers. 

meh."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2014-04-02,2,"This Starbucks is situated in an intersection with about 4 other Starbucks around.

Decently quick service, but the line can be long at times in the morning.  

I don't usually post reviews about Starbucks, since that would be like 20 of them I'd have to review about the same thing.... but, I ordered a venti quad Caramel Macchiato and it had coffee grinds in it.  I brought it back, and the barista looked at me like I was crazy and said ""that's just the caramel"".  Really?  You don't think I can distinguish caramel from coffee grinds, which by the way, look nothing alike.  Anyways, I was flabbergasted and they made me a new drink anyways after a dirty look and my new drink still has coffee grinds floating around in it.

Maybe drinking coffee grinds is normal."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2014-01-30,1,"Today I had a ridiculous experience at Starbucks, 290 6th Ave, New York, NY, Rockefeller Center, New York. I thought we pay a premium for the service so it seems ridiculous to be treated in a condescending way by Starbucks employees. Today, January 30, 2014 at around 8:45AM, when I stood up in front of the counter to pay for my coffee the lady at the counter (don't know her name) tells me "" I am going to the bathroom and she walks away"". Now the funny part is that she didn't go to the bathroom. She just stood beside the other lady at the counter so I don't get it. She lies and then walks away on me. 

Please save yourself from being harassed!!"
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2013-04-23,1,"This place is horrible! Till this day, I just can't seem to wrap my head around how horrible their service is. 

Located in the heart of midtown, you would think this Starbucks branch would be able to handle an abundant amount of people. If I'm waiting 15 minutes for a drink (literally, I actually timed this), then you know there's a major problem. I notice that the baristas behind the counter are more concerned with gossiping about each others lives than doing their jobs.The ones that are working, however, are so unorganized and ridiculously slow! There are 7 people behind the counter, laughing and gossiping (you can hear their conversations loud and clear), but it takes you 15 minutes to make my drink? Your location is key, people have to get back to work.

Unfortunately, that's just one of the many issues with this Starbucks. My advise, avoid this place completely. You'll thank me in the long run. If it weren't conveniently located in my building, I would avoid it as well."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2013-03-01,3,"This is a unique little shop in mid-town Manhattan, which serves and interesting assortment of mostly coffee-based drinks, but also other hot and cold beverages and some light food items like pastries and sandwiches.  They call their employees ""baristas"" - how cute.  They have a cafe-like atmosphere where people just seem to hang out sipping their drinks and using the fee WiFi.  What a cool, unique place.  I wish they had Starbucks where I live....

Just kidding.  It's Starbucks.  Pretty much like every other Starbucks on the planet."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2013-01-18,1,"it's unfortunate that my first yelp review will be a negative one. i'm understanding to the daily demands of primadonna coffee fiends - i've been a barista in the past so i know the drill.
having to make coffee runs shouldn't be that much of a hassle, and it is, daily, because of this establishment. forget my order, get it wrong, look off in the general direction of the ceiling while i'm simply trying to order (which probably leads to all of the aforementioned)... come on now. if it weren't for the location of this starbucks, i wouldn't come back."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2012-02-29,3,This Starbucks is located right after you exit the train station. It is good for early morning coffee runs. I only come to this one for the vanilla mini scones and thats it. No coffee or anything just the scones. I can see how this place could be over crowded. Best to come before 10am.
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2012-02-27,2,"typical starbucks but VERY crowded and they really need someone to clean the counter where they keep the cream and sugar, etc.  it was DISGUSTING."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2011-10-21,1,"Rude. Rude. Rude. 

We went to purchase a NY mug for a friend. We didn't know which one she wanted so we snapped a photo to text her.

The manager came over to us and very rudely told us we couldn't do that. 

We tried to explain the situation, but she kept repeating the same phrase over and over without looking us in the eye!

I could understand this behavior from a barista, but a manager? Never mind the fact that Starbucks has a very clear policy of ""the customer is never wrong"" (my wife was in Starbucks management at one point). 

Never mind the fact that the mug designs aren't copyrighted. 

From a basic customer service perspective, this whole situation was completely absurd."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2010-08-29,2,"This place keeps getting worse and worse.  I typically have to wait at least five minutes for a caramel macchiato and today I had to wait twice as long because they screwed up and made it an iced caramel macchiato.  If I wanted an iced coffee, I would've asked for one!  The last time I was in there, they total forgot about my order, or gave it to somebody else, and they had to audacity to look at me like I had two heads when I asked where my drink order was.  I may have to start going to the regular Starbucks about one block north (between 53rd & 54th Streets)."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2010-03-09,5,"These guys know my name. They're friendly despite obnoxious customers. They make my latte right. Every time. They even tell me they will remake it if it is not to my liking. How, may I ask, can you not love these guys? 

Oh, and they love the nightlife. They've got to boogie. On the disco 'round, oh yea."
176,starbucks-new-york-531,2009-09-14,1,"There aren't enough hours in a day for me to review every place I've ever been.  But, if you piss me off enough, I will MAKE time to flame you via Yelp.

This Starbucks is no exception and will not be spared from my wrath.  There's no seating in this particular location (as it is in an office building lobby), so caffeine junkies are allowed to get their free refills (with their registered gift cards) if they come back with their coffee cup and a receipt.  Apparently, it's more important for baristas to have in-depth conversations with one another than to give receipts when they are requested, and I found myself in quite the predicament later in the day.  A different barista was downstairs, and had the audacity to tell me that I wasn't there earlier in the day (because I'm secretly a homeless person with an empty Starbucks coffee cup stash, YOU GOT ME THERE.).  I gave her the physical description of the barista who served me earlier that morning, who she pulled out of the back office.  The barista who had served me looks at me and says that she's never seen me before.  Um, are you on drugs that you have no recollection that I'm here every day?  If so, I want some of whatever you're taking!  So the two of them refused to give me a refill which I was going to PAY for and refused to serve me.  Not only are they getting served via Yelp, but a nice phone call to Starbucks Corporate may be in order."
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2019-08-01,1,"I would give ZERO stars if I could. The ladies that work the weekday morning service are so rude. If you ask them to correct your order, they look at at you as if you ruined their life. When you question your order they start talking in their language making me feel like they are talking about me! This has happened several times so now I post my review. I should buy a DD and put these people out of business!"
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2019-03-05,1,"Big fan of Dunkin's Iced Coffee.. that being said, this was honestly the worst iced coffee that I ever had - no exaggeration. If you are looking to pay $4 for a cup of off colored water, this is the place to go."
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2018-11-30,1,"the worst dunkins i've ever been to. the staff is rude and incompetent. I've never seen any of them smile or even say hello. I order the same thing every time and it never tastes the same. They throw the ingredients in and don't even mix it, and you're lucky if they even made it right. 

They need new management and an entire new staff."
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2018-11-09,2,"Honestly the worse dunkin around. The food is subpar. They don't always have donuts. They drinks are a hit or a miss. You might order iced tea and find coffee beans. Also enter in carefully as they leave the floor wet and it gets very slippery. I slipped and they didn't care at all. When I brought it to their attention they begrudgingly mopped it up and moved a mat to the door. That's right there was a Mat just not where it needed to be. Service is awful. They are rushing to meet demand and fail every time. I attempt to order online to save time but they don't call out the orders, they just leave them there to get cold. I asked several times and saw them bring my order out and I was told to wait it was being made. Honestly think I might have to use evil Starbucks because it's not worth the hassle in the morning."
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2018-09-06,1,"The worst service ever! I don't understand why I can never get what I ordered made properly. The workers are always talking amongst each other, instead of focusing on making the correct orders. Also, they don't practice hygiene well, the workers are always picking up the cups with their fingers inside of the cup after they've collected money, I've watched lids fall and they just pick them up and instead of throwing them out, they use them - basic hygiene is non existent here."
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2018-07-18,1,This is probably one of the worst Dunkin's I've been to the customer service is horrific! I specifically ordered my order on the mobile App just so I won't have to repeat my same order and avoid the line... I still ended up waiting about 7mins and to top it off my Coffee was wrong! I asked the employee before I left if all that I ordered was in my cup she assured me it was an boom it wasn't so disappointed!!
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2018-03-30,3,"this is the only dunkin' donut where you can any regular sandwich after 2 PM for $2.99.

very small store."
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2017-11-30,3,Great location however it did not resemble the traditional D&D I know and love. Is a very small establishment with only a few small tables and a VERY noticeable sign telling paying customers they can only occupy a table for 20 minutes. The table we sat at had not been cleaned so we had to help them out a bit. Our coffee and breakfast sandwiches were good.
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2017-07-25,1,"I come in to this dunkin donuts only when I'm desperate and late to work around the corner. I rarely complain about service because I know how difficult and grueling the work can be but this place needs a shake up. They seem annoyed to be there, annoyed with your order, and don't know how to check their baked goods inventory. When I order and pay for an everything bagel then find out minutes later you have none- guess what?? I already paid so now I HAVE to be ok with a sesame. They get my order wrong almost every other time. I swear this time I'm not going back."
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2017-07-23,2,"I was served super old donuts, I don't why is that happened. Possibly it's was there from yesterday, but at least I expect you to tell me that it's not fresh. Thank you for weird feeling in my stomach."
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2016-12-16,1,"Do not ever go here for anything! My coffee took 15 minutes to make and I saw the lady at the food prep station in the back literally dig in the trash to pick up her the cream cheese scoop and just wiped it off. She didn't even go wash it since it was in the TRASH BIN! Also, she didn't even bother to change gloves or wash her hands after she dug in the trash to pick up her scoop! Ugh! So unsanitary. And they have the worst horrible service. That place needs to be shut."
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2016-12-12,1,"After four poor experiences at this location, I refuse to walk into this place again. The staff is rude whenever they mess up an order, and they fail to admit when certain flavors are out of stock when you order (leaving you with a drink you may not like yet still payed for). Even when ordering a simple muffin, they manage to mess that up and give attitude when you try to correct them. Don't bother with this location and go to the one of 43rd and 2nd instead!"
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2016-08-19,3,"the basic dd in manhattan on 3rd ave between 45 th and 48th st. it's early so the shelves are stocked well with donuts , etc. a dz donuts with a few muffins for the road. it's narrow and long inside but a few tables and some lounge chairs so i guess i will sit a while read my paper and use the free wifi a bit. the guys behind the counter are friendly and do talk to customers . i tried a frozen hot chocolate for the first time and it's pretty sweet and tasty. as with any dd it's best to pick up donuts in the morning when they are still fresh and non stale looking. the customers who were ordering coffee and breakfast sandwiches are mostly from the office buildings nearby cause everyone had a name tag id hanging from their neck. overall an ok dd if you are in the mood."
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2016-02-18,1,"I think I'm spoiled.  I'm going to admit that up front.  When I go to Dunkin' Donuts branches out in New Jersey, I generally order, the cashier takes my order and within 5-10 minutes whatever food I ordered magically appears at the end of the counter.  I mean really, this is what happens no matter whether it's the branches in Elizabeth or Linden.  

So when I entered this (relatively) new Dunkin' Donuts near my job I assumed the process would be the same.  It was rush hour in the AM so I expected to wait on line, and to be honest I was very pleased with how fast the line moved.  

Then I got to the cashier and I specified I only wanted a turkey egg white sandwich and she kept trying to upsell.  She automatically put in the hash browns.  I stressed I didn't want the hash browns (they're delicious and wonderfully unhealthy).  She changed the order.  Then I ordered the veggie egg white sandwich (I make it a point to use the word sandwich) and she tried to up sell with a coffee.  Okay, we all have a hustle right?  So I let it go, took my receipt and stood to the side and waited.

And waited.

As I stood there, one person after another got their order.

And I waited some more.

After every person who was on line with me had left, I looked at my receipt and my phone and realized I had been there 15 minutes.  I showed the receipt to one of the employees who was bringing the food to the front.  She looked at my receipt, told me she already made the food and aggressively told me that someone must have ""taken it"".  Excuse me?  Is this number on my receipt for fun?  To give me something to read while I'm standing there?  Why did my order go to someone who didn't have my receipt?  

She took my receipt, went to the back in a huff to make my order.  No apologies, not even the hint of empathy on her face.  Just pure annoyance.

23 minutes after I had put in my order I could finally leave.  The food itself was good (hence the one star) but I will never go back.  Terrible customer service and there are plenty of other choices in the area for a quick breakfast sandwich."
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2014-11-10,1,Stalest donuts ever; simply too old to be sold in good conscience. Do not waste money in this place.
177,dunkin-new-york-43,2013-05-22,3,"I guess the reason why people open fast food restaurants all over the place is because people know exactly what to expect. If you serve the same food at all your locations, people already know what they want. They like the coffee, the like the donuts. Much easier to turn a profit.

This particular establishment caters to the business diner. Somewhat nice. Quick. Easy. It's relatively clean, and the neighborhood already seems to have adopted it as part of their morning."

But walking in and being greeted every time by friendly employees, fast service, and smiling faces are what make this my favorite coffee spot in Midtown."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2020-02-21,5,"Love their Tumeric Latte and the service is always great!  If you are lucky, Jeffrey will be your barista - he's always friendly and helpful!"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2020-02-19,5,I love Gregorys coffee! The baristas are the BEST - they always have positive attitudes and brighten my day. Not to mention they have great coffee and healthy food options.
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2020-02-19,5,"I'm a restaurant manager, so I pay extra attention to detail. Regardless of having the best cappuccinos in the area, what really makes this shop in particular special is the way the staff greets and treats it's customers. Whether it's your first time there or you're a ""Gregular"" they treat everyone with the same great hospitality. Keep it up!"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2020-02-18,5,"These guys are the friendliest! Great atmosphere and the coffee is fire! If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and come by!!"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2020-02-17,5,"I come to this Gregory's coffee location quite often... maybe too often because they already know my order (which I love) I've seen them do this with a few other people, they're always paying close attention to detail. Everyone is extremely happy and sweet always greeting with a smile. It really helps to start off the day with such positive energy. No matter the morning rush they're always cool calm and collective, and continuously delivering the best customer service. Shoutout to that whole team on 52nd making my experience always a positive one!"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2020-01-30,5,"A very cool space, in a not so cool neighborhood. I don't drink coffee but I def like their baked goods. I am in the nabe once a week and I always pick up something delicious to snack on. Their staff are very hip, as is the soundtrack. The space is very intimate, but very nice."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2020-01-07,5,"This is the best Gregory's I've been to in the city! The staff is incredibly helpful and kind. I accidentally ordered my latte without saying iced and they remade it for me without hesitation. The coffee at Gregory's is the best ever. The cold brew, the espresso drinks, all are strong and delicious!"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-12-08,5,"highly recommend this place, they have amazing drinks && the pastry's here are really good !! the blueberry muffins are my favorite. The staff here are also super friendly & sweet, this location is really clean & fast with orders. Would definitely be coming often when i'm in the area :)"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-12-05,5,"Honestly best coffee i have ever tasted !! , the staff is really nice and i love the friendly environment"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-12-05,5,"There are plenty of places to go grab a coffee in this area but my go to spot is Gregory's Coffee on 52nd and Madison.  Staff is great, pleasant proactive and they keep the place spotless.  Great selection of pastries and the Crunchy Power Bite is spot on."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-11-22,2,I love Gregory's Coffee but have to write this bad review because I found a piece of plastic in Coconut cranberry scone second time. I hope you guys check it out.
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-11-20,2,"Found a piece of plastic in my Cranberry coconut scone. 
Service is slow like in every Gregorys, charge $0.65 for non dairy milk. Super price in general, especially for a things with plastic inside."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-11-05,3,"Okay can we all just agree that walnuts are disgusting hard little brains that aren't crunchy and just kinda squishy and tasteless and ruin everything? Okay thanks. 

Their coffee is expensive as a mother but it's pretty good and does the job. This particular location is nice and clean and the barista and bar staff are always nice (are or is? Damn grammar). 

I always get a small cold brew in a large cup with extra almond milk and usually if you tried to order this at Dunkin or somewhere else they'd look at you like you're speaking Esperanto but here they don't bat an eye and just do it. And that's what I want out of a barista. Be like Nike and just fuckin do it! No questions, no follow up responses. Just do it. If ordering coffee if the only situation in life where I can boss people around, I want it to go smoothly. And here, it does. 

Anyways, good nutty? Flavor in the coffee. Something similar to chicory? It has a twang to it that is definitely different from what you'd get anywhere else. Ok that's it. Yelper out."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-09-19,5,The coffee here is great. The staff is knowledgeable and nice. The service is fast and accurate. The Barista Shaniah is the best!!! She always greet me with a smile.
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-09-19,5,"Honestly, this is my favorite coffee spot in Manhattan!

For starters, the coffee is great! Especially for those who require a strong cup, as I do... 

But the real reason the Gregory's on 52nd & Madison stands head and shoulders above other midtown coffee joints comes down to one thing - the staff! They're competent, contentious, and above all else, extremely friendly!

For years, getting my pre-work coffee was just the final step in an otherwise stressful commute - most midtown shops have long lines, rude / indiscriminate workers, and just a lack of regard for any sort of customer satisfaction. 

Not this Gregory's! I mean it when I say every staff member is considerate, takes the time to get your order right, and actually makes the morning a little less stressful. It is both rare and refreshing to find a coffee shop like that in midtown...

I originally tried this location because it is close to my office, but became a loyal customer because of the staff. I highly recommend to anyone looking to make their mornings just a little bit more enjoyable!"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-09-18,5,"The staff at 485 Madison is AMAZINGGGG! 
My workday does not officially start until I get to see and greet the staff in the morning & obviously get my coffee fix. Chasity is hands down a gem 

Thank you 485 Madison!"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-09-18,5,"I frequent this coffee shop about twice per day.... the staff is great, service is quick, there are many pastry options, and plenty of seating which makes it great for informal meetings. Many coffee shops in the area, but this one definitely sticks out versus the rest."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-07-17,5,"Great place, nice staff, Beautiful latte art. 
High end coffee for moderate prices. Will deff come back! Enjoyed my time there"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-07-12,5,"I really like this coffee shop. I've visited three or four times before heading to work and usually get a mocha latte but today I've decided to try a pastry and I must say I'm obsessed with the rice crispy bar, so good! The staff there are so friendly and really catered to my wants and questions due to my nut allergy. Not many food places I go to are very patient so this place gets five stars!!!!!"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-07-02,2,"Their coffee is alright. Blue bottle and little Collins nearby are better.  Unfortunately I got really hungry this morning and needed a mid morning pick up. Got the avo toast, disappointed to see the thinnest spread of mash on 1 inch toast."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-04-12,1,"I ordered two ""macchiato "" seems like I got two expresso shots. After i walked all the way to work is when I realized the error that was made. Highly upset. This is not what i expected and cant leave work now to have this changed."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-04-03,2,"The coffee is not good. I've tried pretty much all the drinks on the menu. Drip is weak, yet sour. The lattes sometimes have way too much milk. Iced versions of mocha and matcha tea latte are not mixed well enough, so there are bits of residue floating around. Baked goods are decent. Service is not bad and generally efficient."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2019-01-28,1,They no longer serve Oatley oak milk and serve this nasty variety that they believe is edible. It tastes like sour yak milk (which I unfortunately have had so can vouch). Probably to cut costs. Seriously disappointing and bad business move as everyone in NYC that sells oat milk uses Oatley.
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2018-12-11,1,"Nice looking shop.  Food looks good.  Coffee was nothing special and was weak, yet bitter."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2018-10-15,1,First time going to Gregory's. Super nice staff. Would have given 5 stars but I drank my entire coffee and noticed a black hair. Sadly it was INSIDE of the cup.
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2018-10-02,1,"employees are so demoralized, cranky and unprofessional. have served me the wrong drink (whole milk instead of oat) 6+ times and never apologize even though i have told them i am horribly lactose intolerant / come every day for an oat latte. manager gives zero shits that i had to go home and was sick because he is incapable of writing down correct order. every time i come here i feel i have to effusively say thank you in order for them to cheer up - and also that i am a pain and nuseance when asking for order."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2018-08-29,1,"This place is like a Starbucks masquerading as a real coffee shop. Don't be fooled! The staff don't know the difference between a cappuccino and a cortado despite them both being on the menu. I just ordered a cortado and was handed a cappuccino and when I pulled the guy up on it he dismissively said 'it's the same thing, I just put a bit more milk in Bruh'.

I'm not your 'bruh' and that's not a cortado.

More training required sadly"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2018-01-22,5,Love the Honey Badger drink here - it's very crowded on weekdays but the coffee is worth it! Love how they have two or three seasonal drinks that are fun to try. Would highly recommend getting the Level Up app and ordering ahead as the line easily gets to 15-20 mins on weekdays with nowhere to sit after
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2017-12-13,4,"Background:
Basically a better Starbucks that can be found in any part of Manhattan with offices nearby.

The good:
-Lots of baked goods. At the end of the day (after 6pm) they're 50% off to get rid of the leftovers.
-Many vegan, non-dairy, and gluten free options--best selection of the coffee shops scattered around midtown, in my opinion. The vegan and GF items are clearly marked in the display case with green labels (but not all are vegan AND GF so read the text).
-Vegan treats include: cranberry coconut scone, lemon poppy seed pound cake, energy bites (most of them), and vegan bar.
-Calories on the food labels and full nutritional information online.
-Reasonable prices for the area.
-Free wifi.
-They're on LevelUp and they also have their own app. $5 credit for your first trip + spend $50 and get a $5 credit.

The bad:
-Sometimes things are out of stock, especially toward the end of the day.
-The Gregory's Coffee locations are all very different, so one location may be bright and spacious, while another is cramped. This location in particular is almost always crowded and loud, with people coming in and out every minute.
-Since it's mainly a coffee shop it closes early, so if you want to catch up on work in the evening you'll have to head elsewhere.

Recommend?
Yes! One of the only midtown Manhattan chains I really like."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2017-11-22,3,"I came here in the rain specifically to try a pour over because a review that was posted yesterday said they have them here. I've never had one. Is it worth the hype?

My wonder will continue. I was only in the store when I came in, I thought for sure this would be an I deal time to order such a time consuming preparation. The woman working the bar had no idea what I was talking about. Never heard of a pour over. 

With expectations bottoming out, I ordered an espresso. 

I like the Gregory's logo. 

The place is clean, has a black&white color scheme going and is perhaps a little too well-lit for my tastes. 

The espresso was pretty good. Couldn't help feeling disappointed though..."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2017-11-20,3,"I like the coffee, and the 52nd/Madison location is a block from my work. That said, it still can take forever to get a coffee if you order a pour-over, which I always do, because that's my reason for going to Gregory's--my office has coffee, but it's not worth drinking. If I'm buying coffee, the pour-over is what I want. 

Typically, the staff in this location is very slow to make the pour-overs. You order it and one person looks at another, who looks at another. It seems that no one wants to make it. Compared to the 50th and 7th Ave or the Park and 26th st locations, this place is extremely slow. It could take 10 min before they start to make the coffee, and then it takes at least 5 min to make the coffee. If you don't have half an hour to spare, it's more hassle than it's worth. 

Last time I was there, I went to the counter and 2 people who were working were talking in a corner. They just ignored me--there was no one else in line, no one was waiting for a coffee, and there was only one couple sitting in the store. I waited a minute and then said, ""Excuse me, could someone help me?"" They acted really put out. I explained that I was in a hurry and one of the workers said, ""If you're in a hurry, why order the pour-over? because it takes a few minutes."" I said, ""Yes I know, and that's why I needed to order and not stand around for a few minutes."" Then when I went to pick up the coffee, the worker who made it said mockingly, ""Have a lovely day."" 

Next time I will go to Blue Bottle, which is less than a block away, betw Fifth and Madison on 52nd. The people who work there will actually respond when a customer approaches."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2017-10-21,4,"Good chain. Keeps the coffee clean and simple I would t mind a decaf option, but they do what they do very well."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2017-10-20,3,Came by on a Tuesday early afternoon right after lunch. Location is pretty central in midtown around many office buildings. Couldn't get a seat at first but stood by the personal standing table until one opened. It was cold outside so the heater was a lifesaver! I tried the vegan golden mylk. It basically tasted like chai and almond milk with very little sugar. I got it because it seemed healthy but it was a big bland. It also cost me $6+ which I thought was a lot for what it was. Staff was nice and cheerful. Though it wasn't busy there was a bit of wait to get my drink. Plenty of outlets around the seats so it was convenient to charge my phone.
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2017-08-26,5,The workers are so f-ing nice. So sweet and fast with their orders. I always stop by for a medium iced latte and I've never been disappointed. Their banana bread is also amazing.
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2017-08-14,4,"Very good coffee, friendly staff, ample seating, bathroom 

It only doesn't get 5* because it doesn't have a cozy, special feel to it"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2017-06-26,5,"Great coffee this morning. I spilled a lot all over myself as I usually do, but I was happy to feel the flesh searing heat that came with that delicious cup of joe. Also ate some kind of cake thing for breakfast. It was delicious. I'll be back again in about 6 hours."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2017-03-17,4,"Place is great. Great cold brew. Staff is cool. 

They massively need to fix their door. It's terrible. How have they note done tha"
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2017-03-07,1,"7 March 2017 - While waiting for my coffee this morning, I noticed their barista came round to the front door for 3 mins adjusting the doormat with her hands touching the wet floor (it was raining). Then she went back behind the counter and resumed working with the coffee machines touching the equipment and cups with the dirty hands. Disgusting. I know, I didn't say anything. I can't believe someone working there should need a reminder for washing their hands.
This coffee shop had opened here recently and I have been a regular ever since. But this morning's experience has changed that."
178,gregorys-coffee-new-york-24,2017-02-06,4,"Big add to my office neighborhood area, as it was literally just downstairs near my building. Similar to other Gregory's coffee shops, this one offers similar premium espresso drinks, as well as simple pastries. It was also a bit more spacious than its 55th street brother, that I could actually sit down and enjoy my sip. 

Hopefully it could last longer, as its predecessor only survived for less than 3 months."
179,jimmys-cafe-new-york-2,2015-03-06,5,"This Cafeteria is in the lobby of the Lincoln Building, where I work, and it is insanely convenient for food.  If I'm running late in the morning and I don't have time to eat breakfast at home I can pop in here for an egg sandwich and coffee before going upstairs to my office.  If the weather outside is awful or I don't feel like going far I can get a freshly made sandwich, make my own salad, or choose from the hot lunch choices they have available.  Not only is the location convenient, but the food is delicious!

They also keep a variety of Luna Bars which is perfect for me because I eat at least 1 Luna Bar a day (perfect for a quick snack when I'm busy but starving).  Friendly staff and all around great place for food!"
180,dunkin-new-york-171,2019-11-01,3,"Stop the car so I can run in for a quick coffee run and bite to eat. Place is really small so no eat ins unless you can do it standing. Ordered two coffees that were piping hot and no sleeves for the outside of the cup. Are you kidding me?! I found it a challenge to get the coffee to the car as my finger tips felt excruciatingly in pain. Then went back in for the two English muffin sandwiches I ordered. Transaction went fast zip zip on the credit card. 

Now please note if it wasn't a Saturday we would never been able to have a car waiting out front. But also I do not know how they manage to sell coffee without sleeves? The cups seemed alot thinner than pre-sleeve days. Anyway wouldn't make it a point to go out of my way for this location. Nothing special or out of the ordinary here."
180,dunkin-new-york-171,2018-03-30,3,"Dunkin is what me and bae do with our whole bodies in baby oil before we go out for Bubble Tea.

There are a lot of Dunkin Donuts in New England and a lot in New York City, since the franchise is from New England - and so it has spread like a cancer all over this region. Most of them are very small like your boyfriend and the one product which they have that is pretty good is the hot chocolate. However what I do not like are the coffees and the horrendous Donuts. Krispy Kreme is 127 times better."
180,dunkin-new-york-171,2018-01-26,1,"Walked in and was harshly ""greeted"" by a male on the register. Twice. Very direct, angry, cold, rushed etc. 

We then walked out."
180,dunkin-new-york-171,2017-11-20,4,"Staff is always very friendly and they're so busy they try to move people through as best they can. 

The app doesn't always work which is no fault to the store but very nice."
180,dunkin-new-york-171,2017-11-02,1,"The problem with these tiny DDs is that they usually don't make their own doughnuts, so if you go late in the day, you get what's left over from the delivery. I think that's the case with this one. I bought one of the glazed yeast doughnuts & it was dry & stale & not all worth the dollar & change I paid for it.

The counterperson was lovely & we had a fun conversation about all the cute Halloween things DD was selling. (They really do go out of their way to do creative seasonal things with the decorations, even though it doesn't often change the actual product & I get a kick out of what they do -- like the doughnut that looked as if it had a giant spider perched on top [made from a ""munchkin"" poked into the doughnut's hole & added icing for legs].)

So many DDs that there is no reason to go back & get a stale doughnut because it's cute."
180,dunkin-new-york-171,2017-04-20,5,"I feel weird reviewing a Dunkin Donuts but this is really more about the service. I stop in maybe once a week and every single time I have the best interaction with the workers here. They are always quick and friendly. They run that shop like a machine. 

It's still a Dunkin Donuts so don't get your hopes up thinking it will be the best coffee ever, but it's not bad. Basically as good as a DD gets, so I'm giving it 5 stars."
180,dunkin-new-york-171,2016-03-25,1,"They charge extra for adding flavor to a cup of hot coffee.  Email received back from franchise holder stated that flavor added to iced coffee or lattes is free.  I've never had this experience with any other DD that I've been to, and it's unfortunate that corporate headquarters can't do much about their pricing.  I'd avoid this store if I were you."
180,dunkin-new-york-171,2016-03-07,2,Avoid this location. If you are in this area go to the one dunkin on 10th avenue. This place has terrible donuts and the food quality is terrible. Now granted this is Dunkin and not some too notch donut shop but that is no excuse for the poor quality at this location
180,dunkin-new-york-171,2015-10-26,2,"A solid stop if you're grabbing a quick coffee, but a tough break if you're looking for more than that. It started to feel like the woman running the counter was hell-bent on making sure I didn't get hashbrowns, to the point that I started to have an existential crisis about why the hashbrowns mattered so much to me.

After failing to include them in my order, I asked again at the counter, at which point they were put in someone else's to-go bag. As he tried to return them, I ran up and snatched them out of his hand like Gollum. 

Just not as good as the ones in Boston. Oh well, not like there isn't any other coffee in this city! :-P"
180,dunkin-new-york-171,2014-03-28,1,I am a dunkin donuts coffee fan but this store has worst service ever. I had to wait for coffee in a coffee store.I asked myself twice if I was sure I want coffe. Will never go to this store again

Wah, wah, woe is me, I have to travel or walk or take a train to DD.  But this place?  I don't mind the walk.  I have to say out of all DDs I patronize this place has the nicest people working there. It's not a watered-down DD (like the one of 86th & Amsterdam). It's on 9th Ave, home of the Thai restaurant and other niche places with great happy hours.  But this is a place I'll walk to about a 1.5 mile away.  And that will make it worth it for me to not have DD #OccupyUWS"

Their hash brown things are AMAZING but skip the flat bread sandwich, its like eating plain bread that maybe you'll get a bite of egg with it. Besides that, everything else I've had is good.

I am not sure where that quote came from, but it's one of my favorites. In case you have failed to noticed, I rarely curse in my Yelp reviews. 

With that said, the best way for me to review this Dunkin' Donuts is to write what I said after I had some of their signature coffee and donuts from this location to start my morning in New York.

""Wow. The f**ckin' donuts and f**ckin' coffee are f**ckin' good here!""

I'm too f**ckin' lazy to care what you think of this f**ckin' review."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2020-02-29,1,"I am shocked at how horribly my friends and I were treated here today. My friend went to the bathroom and there were about 7 or 8 kids who pulled her out of the bathrooms and shoved her and yelled at her for no reason. We went to the employees and asked them if they could ask the kids to leave us alone and the employees did not intervene, just told the kids to stop, which they didn't, and went back to their business. We then left and the kids followed us out, continuing to shove us and yelling threats at us about hitting and attacking us. We got the feeling that one of the employees knew the kids and that is why she didn't actually intervene but that is no way to run a business. We were here around 4:35 pm on Feb 29, please talk to the employees who were working at this time because this is unacceptable. I will be letting everyone know."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2020-02-22,5,"I was walking past Lexington ave and I stumbled on Starbucks. The staff and workers here are very friendly and will help you whenever you need it. After my first time I came here also the every week, the coffee here is best you could ever find in nyc. The place is very spacious and clean compared to other locations."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2019-10-26,1,"Left a 5-star review 8 months ago when this was my favorite starbucks to order and do my work in. Dan and the rest of the staff were awesome! However, the staff changes they've been going through have been awful - it's taking 15 minutes to get my online order when it literally used to take no more than 5 even on the busiest mornings. I've also once ordered bantam bagels and it took them - again - 15 minutes of me standing there by the mobile order section to let me know they don't have any ONLY AFTER I ASKED THEM WHERE MY BANTAM BAGELS ARE. Then, I was like sure I'll take a cheese danish and that also took 5 minutes to also say they're out of cheese danishes too. Basically, I ended up spending 20 minutes for a croissant. This location's management changed terribly and I'm now avoiding going there as much as possible unless I really need to. This review is only meant to help them improve and I'll happily take it down once they display some changes."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2019-10-06,3,"Obviously a Starbucks is a Starbucks. The drinks and menu is the same and designed to make us all coffee drinking robots. :)
So the difference is usually the location, service, and inside. 
Location is always good when in Manhattan. Right 64th and 3rd. 
The place is clean overall, but a bit messy at the bar due to the large number of people here and in the city in general. 
Service is very good and the staff is very helpful and fast. 
They have plenty of seating areas. Benches and high tables."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2019-09-26,4,"Biggest Starbucks I've seen on the Upper East Side. You have the 63rd Street Q & F Train Entrance on this corner of 3rd Avenue. I'm visiting a lot of Starbucks these days. I started a new collection called 'Coffee '. I need to fill it with my current bookmarks. I'll add to it. You can know my thoughts about the various locations. This location is great!

I have to say I'm not using the restroom. I will have to let you know if it's locked etc. 
I'm happy with the comfortable space. Lots of seating to select. A great place to meet friends. I didn't charge my phone. I was turned off by the cleanliness of the electric plug. Other than that I was very comfortable. 

You know my Starbucks drill. I get what they call a tall. I'm a plain fresh brewed coffee drinker. I add my own poison! 

If you're in this neighborhood stop here and see if I'm right. This place is pretty clean in the morning. Lines move smooth and employees have it together."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2019-09-19,1,"Awful, the worst. I ordered a tall coffee. It took about 20-25 minutes for them to make it. That's it. Then, one of the dudes became confrontational when I approached them regarding it as if it was my fault."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2019-09-16,5,"Lost my phone here and they kept it for
Me!!!!!!!!! Love this Starbucks ! Luterally love this Starbucks staff was very nice and I felt very taken care of!"
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2019-08-05,1,"Horrible worse then the store by my neighbor, the manager is always rude! I asked for her name and It was never given to me. The answer was none ya! Very unpleasant! She always cuts everyone to use the bathroom! Just because it's your store doesn't mean you cut everyone that's been waiting. One of the employees told me how horrible of a person she is and how bad she treats him! Corporate has to fire this lady and her I'm professional ways!! I feel bad for the hard working employees here! Keep it up you guys are doing great ! Just need a new management. Cause this lady isn't doing her job correctly!!! I will get her name and keep y'all updated!"
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2019-08-02,1,"I hate yelp with a passion, think about that. This Starbucks is so fcking terrible that I used yelp to write a review...also don't advertise it doesn't work. It's a far better investment to literally take a handful of $100's and light them on fire, than using yelp ads."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2019-01-18,1,"I'm not sure if me being a woman of color has anything to do with the service I received at this Starbucks this morning around 6:30AM, BUT I feel as though I was mistreated by the staff from start to finish. When I walked up to the register I waited about 2 minutes before I was acknowledged by cashier. Let me say this, I am a Starbucks LOVER. I would've loved to have a good relationship with this location, I walk by it everyday to and from work. Anyways, I placed my order, then headed over to the pick up area... Something else that I noticed about this location is that the ENTIRE staff moved at a non-urgent manner. I work on the Upper East Side, where everyone is always in a rush, so I was confused by that. After taking my order the young lady proceeded to make several drinks. I waited about 10 minutes before she realized that I was still waiting and has not received the Banana Nut Bread I ordered. I order Banana Nut Bread almost every time I visit a Starbucks, the cashier usual pops it in the oven while im ordering and it is ready by the time I am finished. Maybe this employee figured that I must have time to waste this morning. After my extensive wait at pick up, the cashier comes over and say ""we're out of Banana Nut Bread"". I went back to the register and asked for a refund where several employees passive aggressively asked, or for use of a better word INSISTED that I get something else. Eventually, I was refunded. I shared this experience with my coworkers when I arrived to work, and some of them expressed to me that they've felt the same way in the past when they've visited this Starbucks location. I definitely will never be visiting this location ever again, which is sad because I literally work around the corner. Loss of a loyal Starbucks lover."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2018-11-07,5,Very clean and beautiful space. I love how they set it up. This Starbucks is spacious and they have chairs to sit and huge window side were you can sit and chat with friends while sipping coffee. There wasn't any line maybe cuz I went during noon. The service was fast. Only one restroom.
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2018-08-05,4,"Great staff, fast service. My favorite Starbucks in the area. Can't beat the Iced Caramel Machiatto and even a great everything bagel"
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2018-06-11,1,"Terrible and rude service.  After waiting 15 minutes and watching customers after me get their order I went to the cashier and asked for a refund and told him that most Starbucks compensate for their mistake with a store credit and his response was ""I'm refunding you"".  Well, I never got my order so of course a refund is required-what a genius."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2018-02-26,4,"Right off of the F/Q line which is convenient. I usually get off at 60th and 3rd on the NWR line so this particular location is super convenient for me since I always like to place my order in the app as I soon as I get off the train. 

The staff here is really good about making sure the get your order right. I've made a few customizations in the app and it's always made correctly, which isn't always the case at other Starbucks."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2018-01-30,3,"Standard Starbucks, nothing special.
Staff moves line very efficiently and they do not look miserable. 
Good music instead of the boring music usually played in other Starbucks. Pay with the app, earn points and get free drinks."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2018-01-20,5,Every time I go to my doctors appointment in the area I stop by even though I don't check in to get a latte. Always very happy with the service friendly staff. Have to remember to start checking in.
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2017-12-08,2,"I usually come here to study after class since there's a lot of tables and outlets. I usually don't have any problems when I order through the app or in person, except for today. Trust me, I don't want to start any problems or anything, but today I feel like I got the worst attitude from two workers. I order a grande caramel machiato with extra whip. I have ordered extra whip with hot drinks before and they were just fine. HOWEVER, when I went to pick up my drink after ordering from the app, it was half filled. HALF. I'm paying close to $6 for a half cup of coffee? No thank you. I understand it may have deflated the foam and the whip cream melted, but I don't think that leads to HALF  a cup of coffee. So I told the workers and they gave me this look and they remade the drink. So I approached the counter again to pick it up and there wasn't a label on my cup so I asked if it was mine, the barista (the one who remade my drink) gave me a glare. Loving the attitude on a Friday night."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2017-07-07,1,Horrible staff. They make it obvious that they don't want to be there and just show up for
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2017-02-04,1,"Staff is really rude ,  before learning how to sell coffee ,I think the employees should learn how to keep some respect to customers."
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2016-09-15,4,"After coming here for a while, I start to miss Lex and 63rd. They're way faster and more professional. Lady at the register was nice today but charged me 60¢ for almond milk in my iced coffee. I swiped my card before I noticed so I will take some responsibility for that. Also I realized after you order, sometimes the barista will ask you what you ordered. Makes me wonder where my order goes after it comes out of the machine. 
I'm know this place can improve ! :)"
181,starbucks-new-york-481,2016-08-23,3,"3 Stars relative to other Starbucks. They just remodeled the space with a pretty large seating area but there are hardly any outlets. Before it opened, I frequented the one right below it on 61st and it is far more efficient professional. Also can someone at Starbucks HQ please find a better way to package the hot sandwiches so it doesn't look like someone threw it against a wall after they make it."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2020-01-14,2,"We stopped by for breakfast. Wish we didn't. 

Had to call the waiter over to take our order. He didn't just come to the table. He seemed very detached. 

I had to ask for sweetener for my bowl - yes bowl - of coffee. They didn't just have sweetener at the table. No handles on the cups. 

Then I had to ask for butter and jam for the somewhat stale, sad looking croissant they brought me. They didn't just bring condiments to the table like every other restaurant in the world, or at least ask. 

My daughter ordered eggs and avocado. She got some kind of an egg ""stew"". Not scrambled egg. The egg was a fried egg. She took two bites and was done it was so bad."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2020-01-01,5,"Great service! Fairly priced for New York, and it was delicious! Near the hotel and within walking distance of Times Square!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-12-27,1,This place is way overpriced and the drinks were bad. I had iced green tea and it tasted like water. My daughter had an iced mocha and it tasted like choc milk. It closed at 8 and we came to take a break from walking and sight seeing. They asked us to leave.and shut lights off. Would not come back.
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-12-08,5,"My husband and I enjoyed our brunch experience.  We shared a breakfast sandwich, mini pancakes with fruit and a pot of coffee.  Great atmosphere and food was delicious.  We will visit again!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-11-16,3,"Au bon pain across the street closed and we were looking for a place to get a soup before the theater.

The employee behind the counter asked if we would like to sit at a table.  We did so we waited until an employee said feel free to sit anywhere.  We picked a place only to be told be another employee that section is closed.  The available space was either full with uncleared dishes or incomplete place setting.  We sat at the incomplete place setting spot.

For the evening rush at 6:15PM on a Friday, not sure where the other 2 employees went while this poor employee was taking care of everything -- giving menus, talking orders, collecting bills, and didn't even have time to clean used dishes.  The employee apologies for the delay when we flagged him down for a menu and I asked him why he didn't have help.  The other employees took a break at the same time an influx of customers arrived including us.

Since we were in a rush, we all ordered large chicken noodle soup and I asked for a hot apple cider.  Thankful, the other employees returned to give the poor guy a hand.  We received our soup which is great since was pretty hardy -- vegetables, quinoa, chicken, and pasta.  The apple cider has cinnamon and a must have for a cold night.

Thanks to the employee for the quick service and hopefully he will have help in the future."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-10-25,5,LOVED IT!!! The ginger and lemon tea is my FAV and it was so happy to hear that they offered gluten free bread for the avocado toasts...I'm a happy girl :)
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-10-13,2,"I ordered a sandwich through ritual seeing as the location was very close to where I work. In the end I had a bit of trouble finding this place based off what my GPS was telling me, so I got there like 10 minutes after the time they said my food was ready. When I asked at the counter, they said it would still be a few more minutes, so I waited there patiently for about 10 more minutes. Eventually I asked another person behind the counter and they just grabbed my bag which had been sitting there the whole time and handed it to me. By the time I ate it, it was pretty cold and honestly only alright. I don't plan to come back again."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-10-12,4,"Walked in to this busy spot on my way to work, and loved the rustic, wood-covered interior along with the layout of the restaurant that implemented long communal benches for diners. I ordered The Baker's Breakfast which comes with a portion of avocado toast which had a really firm crunch to it, a small kale, cucumber, and carrot mix that was light with a nice acidity, and a soft hard boiled egg that I had more than a bit of trouble peeling! I also added the addition of smoked salmon which gave a savory, salty taste that really upgraded the avocado toast it was on. The coffee and cream was very mild, but what I really loved was the look of the handle-less cups the drink was served in.
My only reason for not giving this place 5 stars is due to the fact that they were a bit busy and after I finished my food it took about 20 minutes to get my check. So enjoy, but get comfortable because you're not going anywhere for a while!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-10-06,3,Really do not want to hear their employees crabbing about being forced to remove the illegally installed benches and tables on Bleecker Street and Minetta Street. All they have to do is apply for a permit like every other business!!Thankfully the city  is responsive to places like this claiming sidewalks as their very own. Outdoor cafes pay for their space
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-08-02,1,"Ordered the mozzarella a heirloom tomatoe salad, what a joke, they sent it out with crappy plum tomatoes. Where is truth in the menu description?"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-07-13,3,"Food was good, wait staff was off, order taken on time, food brought, never back to check, but kept complaint about the tips from previous ppl. Maybe if you pay attention to your tables your tips won't be bare minimum."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-06-30,2,"I took the ""petit déjeuner"" 
But it's the first LPQ where I received the basket with only 2 pieces of breath!!!
And I was and 14-15 different in my life( NY, Belgium, France)."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-06-21,5,"Stopped in with some coworkers for drinks, so I can't speak to much of the menu, but our server, Marissa, was friendly, lovely, and conscientious. I enjoyed my matcha latte. I've been asked to leave this review (and mention our check number 6540), but the service really was nice enough to warrant it. 

I've had the avocado toast in the past and it's good. (Hard to get wrong, imho.)"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-06-19,5,"I visit this location occasionally during the lunch time while visiting the midtown office. This is by far my number one Le Pain in NYC. I ordered the baker's lunch as usual, which is a quinoa salad and avocado toast with a soup. I totally recommend the lentil soup; absolutely delicious! Although the place gets busy during lunch, service has always been on point."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-05-13,5,The food is amazing. I really like the salads and the drinks. Seating is always great and the service is friendly.
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-05-07,1,"Food was wonderful. However, waiter was very rude and inattentive. We were not given the spreads we requested. After finishing our meal, it took 30 minutes to get our check. Waiter did not return to take payment. When my companion tried to go to the counter to pay, the waiter said we were rude and impatient. I then went to the counter to speak to the manager, and was accosted by the waiter, saying he was very busy and that we needed to wait for him. Absolutely unprofessional and neither my companions or I will be returning to this location."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-04-30,5,"Very nice lunch with my family. Although they were very busy, our server Stephen made us feel as if we were the only customers. We ordered 3 cobb salads, avocado toast and i could not leave without a mixed berry tart. Definitely will be coming back when I visit NYC."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-04-29,5,Went there a couple days ago and the staff was amazing. The service was fast and the food was delicious. I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone.
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-04-29,5,Came here very big spot and it has out door sitting good for the summer but overall the staff was very pleasant!!!!!!
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-04-04,3,"Cute spot, good food, SUPER dangerous seating in the front though. Swivel seats connected to the table are very loose and 4 separate people after me almost fell on the floor or on their faces as they sat because the chairs would move... Unexpected, dangerous, and pretty embarrassing. Should put up warning signs across the table that the chairs swing."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-03-22,2,"I go here for lunch when its rainy since i work nearby and its one of the closest places.  The service is incredibly slow but the people are friendly. However, the food is just so overpriced and mediocre.  Charging $8.99 for mediocre chicken soup (or i'd say for just about any soup in a fast casual franchise restaurant) is just ridiculous.  The tartines are ok but not worth $14.99 as none of them fill me up as spending that much for a lunch traditionally does.  They do have a tartine of the day which is only $10 so i usually get that but for everything else, I really don't understand why they charge so much for so little.  I think they sell a certain look and ambiance and I'm sure the food is healthier than most fast casual places, but i just can't justify eating there except when its the closest, easiest option in bad weather."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-02-08,5,"Really love this place, service is amazing, very nice people a d the salads are to die for. If you like to eat healthy, delicious food this is the place for you."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-02-03,5,"My first time at any of the Le Pain Quotidien and I will surely come back! The soup of the day, minestrone, was absolutely delicious and right tempered so it could be eaten without burning your tongue. I then had the melted cheese tartine; the bread is amazing, the cheese was of good quality, and the chicken not too dry."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2019-02-03,1,"Very disappointed, I eat Le Pain all the time at home and have never had an issue... At this particular location I ordered a soft boiled egg, a tea and a water. The tea was fine but I never received a water. The egg first come hard boiled all the way through and after I sent it back (which I never do) it came cold and undercooked. There is also practically no service at all, was not checked up on once, and had to flag down the waitress in a near empty restaurant. Will not be coming back to this location again, would recommend to walk a few blocks over to a different one if you're looking to get Le Pain Quotidien."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-12-18,4,This place is great my waitress Maria was very nice and respectful and my food was delicious. I recommend to go to this place.
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-12-04,5,I came in for an order to go. The counter people were very polite and eager to help. I was indecisive and they were patient and suggested options based on their  knowledge of food. I received my food in a timely fashion it wasn't a long wait and it was very delicious. My first time there was a success. I'm excited about dining in next time !
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-12-02,1,"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE.  After waiting 35 min, I asked our server to take our order who then told me if I was in a rush I should leave because they were under staffed and she could take my order. I continued to wait patiently when then my order was taken after 45 min of waiting, and I had to get up to get another server. Since they never gave me my coffee after almost an hour. I got up and told the server I was leaving. Worst place I have ever been too!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-11-29,2,"We wanted a breakfast spot where we could sit and relax so this looked promising. Staff was friendly but service was slow, even though it wasn't crowded. The egg skillet was overcooked (eggs were hard, not medium) and served with cold bread and butter. The steel cut oats had maybe been cooking too long because it was completely dried out. We asked for more milk but it would have needed several of their servings to get moistened. Barely edible. The side of toast came late and we grabbed the jam from another table. We'll keep walking next time."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-11-07,1,"Does not offer WiFi but says it offers WiFi on Yelp. There is a WiFi listed but I asked the person at the counter and they said they did not have WiFi. 

So they're lying one way or another."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-10-08,1,"Ugh! The worst experience from start to finish. First I called to place an order and the person picked p the phone like they were at home, just saying hello. I had to ask if it was the restaurant. I ordered a chicken Cobb salad to go and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. I went down in 15 minutes and still had to wait another 10 minutes for my salad, which was shockingly overpriced at $18.50. Please note they did not ask if I wanted it tossed. So, after I pay they don't tell me how long it will be so I want another 10 minutes and finally inquire of status, and they bring out to me a tiny salad that looks like a pre-packages Trader Joe's salad that I could get for $4.99. But wait, there's more. They don't offer me bread, I have to ask for it, then they don't give it with any butter. I left and brought my salad back to my office to find the following - the included ""blue cheese"" was one solid hunk of cheese that they apparently thought I either wanted to eat in one piece or could more easily crumble with the chintzy plastic knife and fork they provide to me (wrong!). Broke the fork doing that. Next, the side of dressing that they gave me was barely half full and I had to struggle to make it last through the meal. All in all, one of the most unsatisfying and thoroughly overpriced experiences I have had in a long time."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-09-04,1,"They were out of stock of two menu items I tried to order, and the waitress came back 20 mins after I ordered to let me know this. The water glasses weren't clean, the smoothie bowl I ended up ordering was not cold, and the egg sandwich I ordered was not hot. I won't be coming back here."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-08-18,2,"Went there on Saturday for brunch. The service was really slow. Once our drinks arrived  I asked for half and half for my coffee and had to re-ask. By the time I got it my coffee was already luke warm. It took a long time for the food to come out. The waiter forgot about a side order of bacon. I ordered a toasted croissant with ham, cheese and egg sandwich. The ham was straight out of the refrigerator on toasted bread and a fried egg. Very disappointing."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-08-15,2,Have been here a few times and every time food has taken 25 min+. Food is decent but don't expect speed
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-08-09,2,"$14.14 (tax included) for half a salad bowl (zucchini noodle pad thai). And to add insult to injury, the service was quite slow for a cold salad. No longer interested."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-08-02,1,Service has gotten terrible in the last month.  15 minute wait to get a cup of coffee. They only have 3 people covering the entire restaurant and take out counter. Avoid if possible
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-07-05,4,"It's a nice place to grab and go or sit down for a quick bite. The salads are fresh, there're plenty of healthy options or sweets/pastries, if that's what you like, the coffees and juices are usually great. The service could be spotty at times, it really depends on the location and time. This location gets busy at lunch time so if you need a quick bite, take it to go. The location next to the Lincoln center is absolute traffic jam, especially before evening performances, so get there early or make reservations at other restaurants in the area. 
Tip: the mini pastries are amazingly deliciously and not too guilt ridden, just a tiny bite of haven :)"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-07-01,5,"Love the service and hospitality, Nathan Manager was very helpful, he told me about the ingredients in all the food. Lovely"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-05-28,1,"Oy, worst service I've ever had at a LPQ. Had to get up and track down a server for a menu and then to order. Food okay."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-05-27,2,The service was super slow.  Waiter disappeared often.  Took over 40 minutes to get a cup of coffee.   The food was really average this time.   And it was basically empty.  They need to step it up at this location.
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-02-26,4,Only had coffee but the service was super special.  Asked if we could have coffee in real cups not paper and they accommodated.  Nice touch.
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-02-14,1,"So this place is opened again after a so-called ""renovation"".  The layout is better overall and the take-out area is better, but other than that, this location may be WORSE than before.  The coffee is STILL loop warm at best. How does a café not serve HOT coffee?  I ordered an espresso this morning and it was barely warm.  They apparently didn't upgrade their coffee machines.  Furthermore, there are far less pastry options than before.  Very disappointing.  As convenient as this place is on the way to my office in the morning, I'm not sure I'll be coming back again."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-01-13,1,"This sucked. 
I ordered a tartine to go and asked them to put a piece of bread on top as it's usually an open-faced sandwich type of thing. An employee asked me if I wanted the sandwich cut in half, I agreed as I was sharing it. After a while (too long to cut a sandwich) I got it back and only one side of the loaf of the sandwich was cut and into 2 awkward pieces. The bottom loaf of bread wasn't cut at all. It happens, no biggie, so I went back inside quickly and asked if it could be cut all the way through. They returned it with the top half cut into 3 pieces this time and the bottom piece of bread not cut at all, again. I went back in and explained to the young woman at the register what happened and she handed it to a guy that just walked through the door and told him to take care of it. I asked him if he was the one that cut the sandwich and he said ""No, I was on break."" Very unprofessional. Now what if this guy had just taken a cigarette break? He had just walked through the door and touched the sandwich when I opened it to show him how it had been cut. They took it back and cut the sandwich into 6 pieces. Six pieces.... It was tossed everywhere and there was honey smudged on the side of the take out box when there wasn't any honey in the sandwich itself... That was all handled the wrong way. I'm understanding of human error but this was blatant carelessness and unprofessional. Not coming here again. Don't bother purchasing from this location. Very poor representation of this company."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2018-01-07,1,"In short, my avocado toast was bland and the service was slow and un-attentive. I don't understand why service was so slow when there was a bunch of staff members present and very few customers (there was probably one more small group aside from my group of 3). Also, it was hella cold inside which was really annoying considering that the weather outside was also really cold. Lastly, why are those doors so damn heavy?! If you've visited this location, you know what I mean. At least 3 other visitors, including myself, walked to one door to find it locked and then walked to the other one, strugglingggggg to pull it open. I almost left because I thought they were closed!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2017-12-16,1,Do not go here.  Service is terrible. No one waits on you. Rude. Asked for water and it took fifteen minutes.

182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2017-11-09,5,"Wonderful French bakery.  When I'm in New York, I always stop to pick up a delicious flaky croissant. I've been here for lunch and it was good, but the pastries are the star."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2017-08-11,3,It was ok... food that was served was food that is bought in bulk from Costco and just heated up. Very cramped and do not recommend sitting near the walls as there are many coffee stains splattered along them. Service was not well -- stood around for five minutes (which at this time was not rush hour) and got seated. Some employees just standing around. Not a big fan but prices not bad. Still wouldn't say is worth the money. Would not come back
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2017-06-20,4,"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat. Ordered the mini pancakes and they were delicious. Food was good, service was decent. Would definitely stop back here again."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-12-10,1,Probably the slowest service I have encountered in NYC. You are basically abandoned if you don't sit in the center of the restaurant. Tables aren't cleared and food takes a very very long time to arrive. Simply not good enough for premium breads and salads. LPQ - you used to do better. Sad
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-11-10,5,"I came in with a last minute order for my office meeting, the manager Antonio and the counter lady put together a nice pastry platter for me. They really saved my day!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-10-22,1,"The worst service ever!!! Very bad altitude and not recommended at all. Thru our visit, I saw two other tables complaining as well."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-10-11,5,"We were very happy with our Fall lunch of squash and goat cheese frittata and warm avocado, kale, seed salad.  The food was fresh, warm and very filling.  Large space with high ceilings for dining. Wonderful service. We will be back."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-09-28,3,"I always love the food here, I even got something different today and got the Apple cider. It was scrumptious. 

That being said, the service here sucked. They were averagely busy with about half of the dinning room filled. My server came by the table twice and I ended up waiting for my check for over 20 min.

I finally went to the register at the front to check out because I had been waiting so long and the server seemed to get irritated that I had left my table.

I'd still come back because I love the food and prices.

3/5"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-09-27,3,"Satisfactory. The warm autumn salad, a seasonal special, was a good value and a giant portion, with a satisfying blend of arugula, quinoa, roast brussels sprouts and butternut squash, pecans, and goat cheese. However the greens were quite dry and needed some dressing. It's unclear if they were dressed at all.

Service here is pretty dreadful but the food didn't take a terribly long time to come out."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-09-03,3,"This place is right by my office and seems like the best option for a mid-key sit down when you need to be in and out in one hour. This will work if you come no later than noon. However, if you come in between 12:30 and 1:30 you will wait and wait and wait some more. Believe me, I came here several times during various time slots between 11:30 - 2. The food is fresh, tasty and plentiful. The service is neglectful and very very slow. This week we actually waited 35 min for our food and only got it after I complained to the manager. We got some chocolate ""sorry"" muffins, but it did not do much to compensate for all the agitation. I think, take out might be a better choice here as long as you pre-order online."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-08-25,5,"Healthy Lunch Choice

Went here for lunch after trying two other places ( one was closed, the other was packed). Nice place. There is a long table at this location perfect for a larger party for lunch or dinner. Service was super friendly, but a little slow for lunchtime. Love that you can get low calorie choices for lunch at a reasonable price."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-07-30,1,"The pain quotient involved in visiting this establishment is very high. Avoid it.

Walked over in the am for a quick breakfast to take back to the hotel. The place we were trying to go was closed (rare Yelp fail) and this was nearby and at face value looked similar.

The service was terrible. We ordered three items and they messed up...three items. Bad start? Check! But maybe the food would be delicious anyway...Nope, total crap. The oatmeal was stone cold, the ham and cheese croissant was dry with a side of yesterday's spoiled salad, and the Belgian waffle was an inedible dry little rock hard platter of pain.

At least they are not lying in their establishment naming...

I will never be back. 3 out of 3 wrong by a large margin = avoid at all cost in my book."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-05-06,2,"This place has appalling service.  I stood at the counter to get treats and coffee and the staff pretended, or probably just didn't care, that I was there.  I eventually just said my order out loud, some guy charged me for it, I gave him my card and waited 5 mins for the worst cappuccino that tasted like hot milk mixed with hot water.  I watched  a customer ask for a straw and staff snickered at him and walked away.  Wow.  Should've just gone to Starbucks,  there are like 5 around here."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-05-06,1,"I have a customer in this building and ate here two days in a row. The absolute worst service I have ever experienced, then you couldn't order items advertised on the wall - they were for take out only. Then they ran out of croissants. After this post i will wait 24 hours for a member of the senior management team to reach out to me. If there is no contact, i will post my precise experience on Social media so consumers know what to expect when they come to this establishment."

Coffee ok espresso is good..
4 stars is enough (;"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-03-13,3,"Since I can't get Yelp to combine duplicate address I'm restating my review. In NYC businesses might have a building address and an entrance on one or more sides of the building. This location is the same as the one on Avenue of the Americas. I asked the manager before I checked in. Very confusing.
It's a huge Le Pain! Free WiFi. Very good service with friendly employees! The best macaroon only $2.00. Nice afternoon snack!  
Close to Rockefeller Center. Lots of shopping and fun things to do in the neighborhood. It's in the Time Life Building. Enter on 50th Street. Near Radio City. 
The server said the Le Pain App is very good. You get a lot of free perks. I may have to try it!! Free pastry when you sign up!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-02-18,2,"A beautiful atmosphere and rustic feel with open-pore wood tables and weathered floors, Le Pain Quoditien has a great ambience that is dulled slightly once the food and bill arrive at the table. My croissant arrived cold (rendering it slightly pointless) and when paired with a lemonade cost nearly $10. A tiny bowl of fruit cost $10 as well. Our waiter was very pleasant, but in short, it's a decor shot for Instagram and not a suggested place to stay."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-02-17,2,The food was OK. It is a organic and healthy restaurant. The concept of it was good but the execution was sub-par. I got the warm Belgium waffle which was served on a small stone granite board. It was not easy to eat. The waffle was small and a little over done. I will not return and do not recommend this restaurant.
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-02-14,5,"Great service, fast!  The place is beautiful and very clean, they really take care of details, i went for my breakfast they have great choices, everything was delicious!!! Love it!! Definitely recommend it, and off course I will come back again!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-02-04,3,I am a huge fan and every time I go to NY it's number 1 on my list. This time was disappointing our server was not friendly nor efficient. We ordered a latte and OJ the latte was Luke warm and came 15 min before my meal. I specifically told the server I wanted my coffee with my meal. I had the avocado toast which was good not amazing . Definitely not number 1 on my list anymore.
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-01-27,2,"Everything looked great, so I was very disappointed.  I had a cheddar and scallion scone and a small coffee.  The scone was really tough, although the flavor was OK.  I liked the crunchy outside, but inside was just hard to swallow.  Their coffee cups leak from the seam, which is a pet peeve of mine, but if they're going to give you coffee with coffee all over the side of the cup that's only going to get worse once the seam starts leaking, they can at least give you napkins.   Customer service was sub-par.  My friend had to ask for a spoon when she bought a chia pudding the other day.  So, no utensils or napkins unless you ask.  There aren't any dispensers out that I saw either, so I just didn't get it.  Underwhelmed for sure.  I don't recommend this place.  There are far better options in this area."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-01-12,1,"This place looks ice from the outside; however, the food and the customer service is very disappointing. My friend and I came here for lunch assuming that the food would be okay judging by the appearance of the place and the prices on the menu. I ordered a lunch combo which cost $15 and I was utterly disappointed about the taste and the size of the food. Also, the waiter got our orders wrong. The food being on the mini-size was prepared poorly and lacked taste. The avocado toast was very salty and not edible at all. I'll never come back to this place."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2016-01-12,5,"As a flight attendant I love to discover culinary places! And this one is just amazing. Had a yoguhrt with fresh berries and I really enjoyed it! Also my coffee with soy milk was adorable. So if you re looking for a culinary adventure you should absolutely try it. there's something for everyone! So dont hesitate and stop by at ""le pain quotidien"" parce que c' etait tres bien!"

182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-12-30,2,"I really wish I could like this place, because the food is good. I especially love the kale caesar salad and the tuscan white bean prosciutto salad. But it is SO expensive, and the service is absolutely awful, both in the dining room and for take away. Complete disorganization at the register, long waits for take out, forgotten orders, botched bills, etc. I've been here multiple times over many years because it is close to the office and as I said, I like the food, and the service never improves. I honestly cannot believe how bad it is."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-12-30,1,"If I could give a zero star, I would! And all 5 stars are off for the incredibly rude and uneducated staff. Every time I'm grabbing something here I'm annoying them, but no worries, they continue their private conversations. They're shouting to each other over 5 counters. They don't look at you at any time (even when handing over food). They don't respond to any ""hi"", ""thank you"", ""please"".

Time to fire all those people!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-12-28,2,"Terrible customer service!! Was decent in September and now apparently no one cares here. Get ready to wait in long lines to place an order, cashiers never say thank you, wait another 15 mins in total madness for your order."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-12-26,1,"Terrible cafe...way overpriced for the food and service.  First we came in with a party of 10...our bill was over 100 dollars AFTER a Radio City discount. The waitress also tried to make up for it with a 10% discount but I'm not sure if it was included.  Our orders consisted of lattes, small soups, two sandwiches and a croissant - lastly one parfait, so imagine our surprise at the bill.  

2nd - All the lattes came lukewarm, the croissant came COLD, the soups were lukewarm as well.

3rd - I'm sure this wasn't the waitresses fault, but there was POOR communication on what is in stock.  She had 3/5 people change our choice of soup because they ran out, my party was done eating by the time I got my soup. Waitress kept coming back and forth offering soups.  Omg the salad offered with the sandwich wasn't that great either!

TL;DR Overpriced, cold food, confusing service.
PLUS - Nice environment, near proximity to Radio City Music Hall."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-12-17,1,"Our party was a group of 7 people and they brought 5 of the 7 meals out wrong to then make us wait another 20 minutes for our food, on top of what we initially had to wait. Expensive food for a small quantity, so I don't recommend this specific restaurant whatsoever. Horrible service and half-decent food."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-12-05,4,This is a perfect place to meet a friend or client. The space is big and clean. I really like the avocado on toast. The oversized coffee servings hit the spot.
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-11-21,2,"I did not rate this location 3 or 4 stars because almost every time I come here, they are out of what I want. Today, they were out of the soup of the day and the wine I ordered. Otherwise, the food is pretty good. I like the seasonal changes to the menu. The service is very good. Our server Fabiana was friendly and knowledgeable."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-11-15,3,"The quality of the food here is good, but come on with the ridiculous prices for the portion size. I just bought a $15 Baker's Lunch (1/2 avocado toast, small salad & soup). When I opened it up, the soup was literally HALF full. Pretty infuriating when you spend that much on a mediocre midtown lunch.
Won't be returning."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-10-07,1,"Sit where your comfortable?!! This le pain has very rude staff with no education or respect for families. I popped in on a long walk downtown to have a coffee and sat in a quiet section so I could feed my baby. They said to get up because she ""needed"" the table. The dining area had more than 20 available seats and he huge table in the middle was also vacant. Moreover, the vanilla bean latte had no vanilla in it. It was basically a cup of milk. Ive ordered this drink multiple times in ues and its always on point. We specifically asked to sit in the quiet area and the manager said okay but then she took it back!! Will never go there again."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-09-29,3,"I think this place is ok. I like the atmosphere when I passed by. They have indoor and outdoor seating. I tried their cheese danish and Chocolate Croissant. The cheese danish tasted good. But the Chocolate Croissant isn't better than the one in Au Bon Pain, even though it's a little bigger."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-09-25,2,Went for lunch. Service was nonexistent the server never even came to check on us and they ask for 18% LOL! Food was just okay. I would not go back.
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-07-13,2,"Horrible service and food to match.  Came here just for a quick break just wanting a snack and a drink;  Decided to try the chia seed pudding with berry compote since that seemed unique to this place.  The pudding itself was sour and almost stale, not sure if they were going for a fermented taste or not, but it definitely had some elements of that in it.  Maybe it was a poor compote which was rather sour, I was hoping it'd be somewhat sweet but it was not.  Also had a glass of their mint lemonade which tasted pretty poorly done.  Not sweet enough and a bit bitter as if the rind had been left in.  The service is also really poor here with servers constantly chit chatting and not attending to the tables.  I saw a couple other disgruntled customers while I was here.  I wouldn't come back here."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-07-04,4,This is our go-to spot. Quick service and organic food. The Belgium waffle with the dip is amazing!
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-06-06,3,"Been to Le Pain Quotidien twice. The first time I came service was slow/non existent. Today, I decided to stopped in again w/ a friend of mine since it's near my work. This time around our server was friendly and attentive. She suggested a few specials but we knew exactly what we wanted. We shared their chicken Cobb salad, salmon tartine, and strawberry rhubarb crumb. For the most part, everything was good. I can admit this place is good for a quick bite/beverage.

I'm giving Le Pain Quotidien a 3.5 stars although restrooms definitely needs maintenance!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-05-03,1,"Where do I begin?

1. Expensive for what you get: Ham & Cheese Croissant, scone, yogurt parfait, yogurt and granola, two coffees and a kale drink --$53!

2. Service was slow and very indifferent. In fact, they looked like ""Stepford waiters"".

3. We told the waitress that we had to leave by a certain time. We had 5 mins. left before we had to leave.

4. It took 30 mins. to get mustard and stevia sweetener.

5. All in all we should have gone to Au Bon Pain across the street.

6. Men's Room was a mess and dirty."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-04-19,1,"I typically think Le Pain has excellent food. But dining here with my family was a terrible experience. The server was not knowledgeable of the items on the menu, she stood chatting while my wine sat in front of her for 5 minutes, (restaurant was dead) she dropped part of my dish, she charged my wife $5 for cheese after challenging my wife that she couldn't substitute items (she just wanted cheese on her sandwich), and the floor and bathrooms were dirty. Alain Coumont would be horrified. Not worth the $144 bill. Like I said, I have always like Le Pain, but maybe when you get too large, quality suffers."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-04-05,1,"Worst service! Our order was taken twice and we waited 45 minutes for food which turned out to be mediocre! Cappuccino was bad! Orange juice was good, that's the best I can say. Won't be returning here again"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-03-24,5,"Come by and see server Elaine! She knows her stuff and such a young professional. I came in to do some work on my laptop {free wifi} and to try something new. I was craving  meat chilli and ended up with their vegetarian organic chili to eat in, then she ask me to walk to the bakery area and explained all the popular bakery goods and ended up with 2-organic mini-brownies 1- chi seed muffin to go! Elaine was sooo NICE, she wouldn't let me leave without trying a sample of their Belgium hot chocolate which was so yummy too but I was so full to order it!! I highly recommend coming here if ur in the area touring NYC or working in the midtown area."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-03-15,3,"I am being generous giving this place a 3 star review as I was disappointed with how downhill the chain has gone.  I love the idea of the community tables and the menu is overall very fresh and uses great ingredients.  The bad outweighed the good in todays case.  I went and ordered a small bowl of berries and boy was it small! I also ordered a smoked salmon salad and was not given any bread as it said in the menu.  When I asked the waiter sort of complained saying she had to get it from downstairs.  I understood they were busy on a Sunday at around noon, but I shouldn't have to ask for the bread that accompanied an already overpriced salad ($18 for salmon and a small portion of arugula salad with two slices of beets and cucumbers).  
It is still a good go to place for a quick bite, pastry, or coffee and tea but do not get your hopes up when going for the table service.  Always expect to see kids there so if you are not a fan of kids at the table (especially when sitting at one of the communal tables) steer clear."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-02-22,3,"Stopped in for lunch. Vegetarian three bean chili with avocado. Side of bread. 

The chili was good. Stewed tomatoes had a great texture. Flavor was good. 

Bread was a little dry. 

Overall food was okay. Service was slow. Took 20 minutes from when they cleared my table to bring me a check. 

And the meal itself was a little pricy $12 for a bowl of chili."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-02-11,2,"$5 for below average hot chocolate! I do not like an overwhelming amount of chocolate (i.e. I had to dilute City Bakery hot chocolate with a 1:1 ratio of milk), but this hot chocolate to go had barely any chocolate in it at all! It was just hot milk with the faintest scent of chocolate and no taste.

I brought it back and they made me a new one, which was drinkable but still not chocolatey. It probably had 50% of the normal chocolate flavor one would expect from a standard hot chocolate.

I wish I had asked for a refund and will not be ordering this again. Next time I will put my money to better use at Jacques Torres or Bouchon for good quality hot chocolate."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-02-03,4,"This is one of the most boogie places I find myself in when I am in this area. 

But God is that food good! 

I stopped by Le Pain because I wanted to treat myself to a nice brunch after I mustered the strength to attend an early church service after a full night of partying (go, me). 

When I stepped into the place, it looked like I was stepping into a cafe in DUMBO. It just, at least to me, had a certain air of pretension that I just could not shake. Maybe because I didn't ""look the part."" 

But anyways, I sat down and I ordered a frittata with cauliflower, cheddar, and kale. I also ordered a honey ginger and lemon hot drink. Both of the things I ordered were AMAZING! The frittata came with a side of some really good bread, with some Greek yogurt and a house salad. 

Would I go back? Sure. I'll just make sure that I am wearing my Sunday's best next time."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2015-01-29,5,"This Le Pain is great place to go when you are looking for a quick lunch or afternoon snack. They have excellent sandwiches which they make fresh and also salads. I really appreciate the vegetarian and vegan options, not many chains pay attention to this. This location in particular is quite great. There were a lot of people there (because they know a good thing). Staff was very nice and helpful.  The manager, I think his name was Stew, came over and asked us how our food was. He was so cheery it made our entire experience great, thanks Stew! Also, I ate one of the best muffins I´ve ever had!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2014-12-28,3,"This location has lots of tables, a few booths and a communal table. You seat yourself and wait for staff to address your needs. I feel like this location needs a 3rd wait staff member, but it's cuz I came in when I was already thirsty and hungry. One staff per 10 tables results in slow service and feeling of being invisible. When the staff get to you, they are warm and friendly.

First time eating lunch at this franchise. The food is good. My friend asked for a hard-boiled egg. I told wait staff that she has health concerns. Apparently that wasn't conveyed to the cook. She still got a soft- boiled egg.

Also, we shared a Warm Belgian Waffle. Maybe it was warm when I photographed it. Lol. It was sweet as if caramelized and buttery like a croissant. Whipped cream reminded me of Greek yogurt. Cream balanced sweetness of the waffle. 

I ordered the 3-bean chili with 2 slices of crusty bread. Served hot so that's good to eat on a winter day. The addition of avocado mash and scallions was nice cuz that makes it different."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2014-12-27,1,Looks nice but they had ran out of lots of things both food and drink. Staff did not care or inform us prior to ordering.  Big let down and not worth the money.
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2014-12-23,4,"Came here around 11 on Sat, was quite at first we were seated quickly (Note as we sat started to get busy) . Had the curry chicken which i found delicious (it comes with this peach chutney that was great diff would asks for more next time i go). They offer beer, mimosa, an a apple cider fizz. Everything here is organic, and loved the spaculose (need to go back just for this)
The services I found was attentive. From the hosted who sat us, to our waitress (Stephanie). And even the mangers Chris and Nick (I remember there names cause i was with my nephew who towards the end of our meal decided to have a mild tantrum, they all came over to find out if they could help. And were understanding)"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2014-12-23,2,"Horribly slow service in a largely empty restaurant.  Food was cold.  There are so many good places around, it is impossible to recommend this restaurant."
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2014-10-09,2,"Ok, I'm just a visitor, but this has to be the worst of these restaurants in the entire chain. So loud that you can't hear the waiters. REALLY loud, even when compared to similar busy lunch places. 2 stars only because baked goods are still good, but ....

Be warned. There isn't a real kitchen here. Foods are premade and then heated. (Yuck!) I only found this out when I tried to order an omelette that I get at other locations. No I letters. No custom anything, because premade! 

Ok, so I order oatmeal. Can I have brown sugar with that? Nope. No brown sugar. How weird is that?! (Oatmeal was inedible, btw. Gloppy and tasted like glue. Quaker Instant is better.)

LPQ is SO good elsewhere! No idea why they would open a place that could ruin them for people who don't know them or how good the food is at other locations.

I should add that the host and server couldn't have been nicer. Whatddya bet the waiter wasn't supposed to tell me about their lack of real kitchen? I'm sure if they see this, they will instruct staff to say that the ""chef"" (heat-up person) ""doesn't like"" substitutions or something like that so that they no longer admit that they are serving pre-fab food!"
182,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-136,2014-08-30,5,"I came for coffee and to sit and study.  Host seating customers was so kind!!  And great service, fantastic latte with almond milk :)"
183,reys-deli-new-york,2018-12-31,4,Rey's deli is a great neighborhood bodega. It has moved to a new location on ninth avenue in these past few days. I will miss the convenience of having it across the street from my brother's apartment at 747 10th avenue.
183,reys-deli-new-york,2018-08-19,5,I've been going to rays forever. It's a great neighborhood Bodega. Great sandwiches ice cold beer. Service is quick and courteous. Even the cat that lives there is nice. I can't say enough things nice things about this place.
183,reys-deli-new-york,2014-11-23,5,Might not look like it from the outside but this place makes great sandwiches. I've been going here for over 30 yrs.

This place is great, and has a lot of ""Old New York City"" charm, yet surprisingly all of the products are clean and orderly even though the store itself is more than a little bit run-down (which to me just adds to the overall character/experience).

The beer is dirt-cheap and ice-cold, there's a huge selection of canned foods and cereals and ice-creams, and their sandwiches are always spot-on... I've ordered all three of their combination dinner offerings -- pastrami with lettuce and tomato and cheese (swiss), corned beef with lettuce and tomato and cheese (muenster) , roast turkey with lettuce and tomato and cheese (provolone) -- they're not stingy with ingredients and everything is fresh and flavorful -- they only charge you an extra $50 if you want to upgrade from a regular roll to a ""hero"" -- and, they're very friendly -- all three times, I asked if the 20 Oz Coca-Cola that's supposed to come with my meal could be replaced with a 24 Oz Colt 45, and they said ""Yes, no problem."" HUZZAH!"
184,signature-cafe-bar-new-york,2017-10-05,3,"This little cafe inside the Signature Theatre building is run by Great Performances, which I love for its commitment to service, culture and sustainable local agriculture. I even brought a group of college students to their farm upstate! However, the cafe is far from Great. For starters, given the casual environment and paper plates/cups, prices are a bit high. A sandwich is $9 (with no sides), a cup of drip coffee/tea is $3, and a glass of wine is $11. 

My grandmother and I both ordered crispy eggplant sandwiches. An eggplant, fresh mozzarella, arugula and tomato sandwich could be so delicious. In fact, it's pretty hard to mess up. The bare minimum here is for it to be evenly heated, given that they're not made-to-order. The cheese on both sandwiches was melted, but the eggplant slices were between room temp and still-cold. They were very, very far from crispy. There were some greens, but they were flavorless, with none of the kick of arugula. Maybe they subbed lettuce without telling us?

Service is apathetic at best, often careless. The cashier closed the register without giving us our change, looked at us like we were lost, and then proceeded to take five minutes with a calculator to figure out the amount owed (21 minus 18 isn't hard math). No apology. 

The heavily advertised happy hour is $5 house beer, $6 house wine, and $7 house liquor. It's no better than other happy hours in the area. Cocktails are always full-price ($13), which I suppose is standard in Manhattan, but if I'm going to spend that much on a cocktail I expect a better ambiance. 

The wifi is solid and other than the hour or so before and after showtimes, there is always plenty of seating at four- and two-top tables. There are also a couple of cushy armchairs. It's a neat place to hang, and a super convenient place to grab a bite before a matinee. My grandmother is 93, so the accessibility here (elevator, relative quiet, restrooms, proximity to the theater) is paramount. I know we'll continue to eat here before shows, but I wish the quality was better."
184,signature-cafe-bar-new-york,2016-09-01,3,"This place is stark, hygienic, spacious and has a really great quiet open space right off the Hell's Kitchen bustle. 

It kind of has a college cafeteria vibe. The chairs are not comfortable, the light is unromantic and it has almost no vibe. The food is basic. After a show its pretty good because it's bit cramped but I wouldn't say Signature Cafe and Bar has personality enough to go out of your way."
184,signature-cafe-bar-new-york,2016-03-27,4,"My friend Jeff L. Introduced me to this place. Not only is it a great place to come see a play but also to come relax, recharge, have a drink or snack. Place is well maintained and clean. There are three theaters here to see reasonable productions.  The seating area by the bar and snack area has tables and coaches. There is a stage where live music is performed. Really great place to come and relax before and after a show."
184,signature-cafe-bar-new-york,2016-03-10,5,Great place to grab drinks or some great small bites preshow. I also found out they are open most days in the afternoon. Love stopping by to catch up on some work (free wifi) and have a snack. Midtowns best kept secret !!!
184,signature-cafe-bar-new-york,2015-11-21,2,"I've been coming here before each show (I have a subscription, so several times a season) since the Pershing Square site opened. Great pre-show atmosphere with live music, but the cafe has been getting worse and worse. Most items are bland and stale; they've dropped some of the regular items that were at least reliable if not great; and now they're just being petty and cheap--they filled the soup container only 3/4 full and tried to tell me they've always done it this way (I've ordered it several times in the past and always got a full bowl, with crackers on the side. No more, and the staff are condescending when I tell them it hasn't always been this way. Aargh!).  A month ago I was served wine in a glass; tonight a plastic cup (and it's nowhere near showtime, which is when they usually pull out the plastic so you can take the drink into the theatre). If the staff were just a tad apologetic, or even honest in admitting that they're cutting corners now, I might be more forgiving. Instead, their attitude is insulting."
184,signature-cafe-bar-new-york,2015-05-18,1,"Sorry to say this, but the food here is just awful. How can you ruin a tuna fish sandwich?  Ask the chef.  He knows.  And as for the Trio of Empanadas, bean and cheese indistinguishable  from the beef, and ""spicy chicken,"" don't make me laugh. The most bland item I ever tasted.  There wan't a spice within blocks to that dish.
Apparently the Chicken Caesar Salad is edible, but your best bet is to eat somewhere else before or after the play."
184,signature-cafe-bar-new-york,2015-03-01,5,"A great place to grab a quick, affordable bite and/or drinks before and/or after the show.  Plentiful of seating and outlets.

Late Night Happy Hour is after the show around 9 pm till midnight.  $4 House Beer, $6 House Wine, $6 Specialty Cocktail."
185,wattle-cafe-new-york-2,2019-10-30,2,"I ordered the down under truffle smash - which the description detailed as avocado toast with truffle, feta and smoked salmon with scrambled eggs on the side.
Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find I received the order without any smoked salmon."
185,wattle-cafe-new-york-2,2019-08-23,4,"The breakfast buffet at our hotel was $26 a person so we looked for alternatives. $26 is great if you just did the Ironman and can take in a lot of calories to make it worthwhile. 

Just a couple of doors down was this place. I appreciate the interesting food choices and it all tasted great. I had a chai latte. I didn't know you could get them without sugar as the chains use syrup. Now I prefer the no sugar version.

I had the Aussie waffle which was great. They aren't especially efficient depending on what you order. My wife liked her smoothie. 

We liked it enough to drop in the next day as well."
185,wattle-cafe-new-york-2,2019-07-11,1,"Slow, rude service. Out of avocado at 730am. Took ten minutes to get a coffee poured. Stay away."
185,wattle-cafe-new-york-2,2019-07-08,5,I ordered the expresso it was good. The location is a great spot for tourists as it is by a hotel and by grand central station a lot of foot traffic. The place is clean and organized. People there were nice. In and out very fast.

He listens intently to what you are ordering and suggests other flavors you might like based on that information.  He is current on all specials and offers, and is very patient as he guides you through an enjoyable experience."
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2019-10-12,5,"Thu was extremely helpful, patient, and thorough as we made our decision to purchase a coffee maker, frother, and coffee pods.  We have enjoyed our Nespresso espresso machine for 10 years, and we were now ready to purchase an updated model for coffee and espresso.   Thu helped us with the purchase, and even arranged for a future shipping shipping date to our  home.  She also was very prompt in replying to  follow-up emails regarding pricing and delivery questions and details. We are looking forward to using our new, upgraded coffee maker and frother."
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2019-06-15,1,"I've been shopping at Bloomingdales for a very long time & must say that trying to buy some pods & get some information at the 59th street location was my worst experience ever. 
    The woman who waited on me was unbelievably rude. Without listening to my question, she answered what she thought was my question. I told her again what I needed explaining on the machine I recently purchased...her answer was "" I already told you"". Honestly, I've never experienced such a bad attitude from a sales person ANYWHERE.
     I had a business of my own for over 30 years and if I had ever heard that one of my employees had acted that way to a customer, she'd be let go immediately. 
     With the retail climate as it is...now is the time to be nicer than ever to customers trying to spend money in a store.
     So, I went home & ordered my pods on Amazon...a small minded woman. They called her the ""manager""...it doesn't get worse than that...."

No more being hooked on buying overpriced, environmentally unfriendly coffee from one source.

Done with this game."

186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2018-03-18,1,I've been coming here for many years and never had a problem except this time. I got the wrong guy to help me and it just ruined it for me . I am not posting his name but I'll make sure I don't ever get him again on my next visit .
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2017-12-09,5,"Have had a Nespresso machine since this past summer.  Life changing.  Tucked away on the 8th floor of Bloomingdales is a small boutique with all kinds of pods, accessories, machines, glassware, etc.

Just like the huge stand alone stores, this one allows you to try before you buy.  I was able to try two limited edition pods--licorice and snowball.  The licorice was interesting and indeed tasted like black licorice.  The snowball was fantastic and had a subtle coconut/marshmallow flavor.  I ended up buying some of these.

I would return if I lived in the area.  It is also fun to browse the other sections of the 8th floor where all of the cooking stuff is located.  There's an extensive selection of things (on the floor not in the nespresso boutique) like le creuset cookware, georg jensen serving items, and other high end foodie items, so you can get your sample espresso and browse while you sip."
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2017-02-11,5,Big shout out to Christopher who helped me with how to properly operate my Lattisimma Plus machine; he's the man!
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2016-12-08,5,"Great place and great service! I bought the lattissima pro online and came in to buy coffee. The lady with the British accent (forgot her name) was super patient and nice, explained everything and didn't roll her eyes not even once! even after I tried 5 or 6 different roasts. thanks to her I now know I only like their dark roasts and ordering capsules will be super easy from now on :)
If you're thinking about buying an espresso machine, stop buy for a free drink and explore your options."
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2016-10-21,5,"Great coffee for your nepresso machine . 
If you purchase anything you can get a free coffee for you and your mates. They are always coming up
With new flavor and I like the interesting way they package and display products"
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2016-07-23,5,The service was very fast and most importantly pleasant. I was on and out in 3 minutes. They were very cheerful and friendly. Went over new flavor and specials.

If I'm not getting my cappuchino every morning I'm going to be a disaster! So I'm glad we purchased nespresso machine and lots of different flavors... THANK you  for the store staff, thank you for your patient, recomendations, help,time, great sence of humor and hospitality!!!"
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2016-01-03,5,Great service by Fabio.  Left with original glass collection cups and enough coffee for the year.
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2015-12-26,4,Service was very slow and inconsistent. Multiple staff but only serving two customers. But when served. Service was friendly and knowledgeable. Generally better service at the stand alone Nespresso stores.
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2015-12-24,5,"Best Service.
Fabbio, gave us wonderful Service.
He was courteous, polite and freindly.
He was knowledgeable about his company's products.
He was also quite intuative in his suggestions, after gauging what our preferences were.
We are long term Nespresso lovers and he maintained that appreciation.
We bought a new machine and 8 x sleeves of pods."
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2015-09-23,5,"They are so great! Super friendly and nice! They wanted to register everything right then (when I bought my machine) and loved talked about the product and gave great recommendations when picking out coffee. 

Plus, free espresso while shopping."
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2014-12-26,1,"Worst service ever.

The staff was too lazy to explain the special editions and when I asked to repeat (because she spoke way to fast) she was killing me with her eyes. 
After we paid, she grapped the bag like it was trash and put it in our face.
She didn't even offer us a cup of coffee, while every costumer held one. 

Go to another nespresso boutique."
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2014-08-12,4,"You just can't go wrong with Nespresso and I'm a huge fan of Bloomies...So put the 2 together and I'm in heaven :)

I'm pretty much a regular here for our refill pods as well as pod recycling. Friendly staff, plus you can get yourself an espresso or cappuccino to-go after your purchase.

They are separate from Bloomies but are located within, so just know that if you're paying w. your Bloomies card. Plus, if you're a frequent shopper and Nespresso member, make sure you get the keyfob. Makes life a lot easier!!"
186,nespresso-boutique-at-bloomingdales-new-york,2014-03-07,5,Good staff! Good place to try nespresso for free and check out diff coffee. Cool place to check out! I tried elvazio.

187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2020-03-12,1,"I've always enjoyed each LPQ I've been too,  but for some reason the 55th Street one has a staff that is not the friendliest. I've been in their many times. 

For example, the unfriendly waitress said without ANY welcoming expression that if we are not going to eat anything substantial (besides having drinks and muffins), she'll have to move us for someone who will order such food. I was surprised. 

We ordered our drinks and said that we are not sure yet what to eat and to give us a second. She continued her attitude and literally banged the silverware on the table and brushed us off. We were too nice and didn't want to get into it with her. 

We were there an hour, there were plenty of seats but she handed us the check yet we weren't  finished. 

I don't want to  pull the race card, but it seems like everyone else does.  I'm white and feel she was racist and unprofessional.

Don't go here."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2020-03-08,3,"When I visit NY I always have in mind Le Pain Quotidien as breakfast choice. However, comparing the last time (years ago) to this time, my impression is it is not so good as before, but it is still a good option. You have options of breads basket, sandwiches, slow cooked eggs, quiches, waffles and so on. I really would like to have scrambled eggs as well, but they don't have it. The service is nothing than the ordinary."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2020-03-04,2,"This place has the worst service of any LPQ I've ever been to. The waits are incredibly long for takeout food during lunch, the people behind the counter frequently disappear for extended periods of time, and it's just not run well. I am hesitant to blame the staff, but I think the management here is to blame because everyone seems miserable. The food is just as good as at other locations, hence the two stars."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2020-02-25,1,"Well, if one wants a penultimate experience in rude, impatient, customer unfriendly service, this is the right place. Patrons taking a moment to look over the menu - sorry, you're wasting the precious time of the wait staff. No need to come back - it's ok; my colleagues actually didn't REALLY come here to eat, just experience the milieu of swanky staff that seemingly aren't paid to serve patrons but rather give them an experience in eye rolling. Ah well; it's perhaps a test - an understanding of the first noble truth, that indeed, all life is discontent, or suffering. I'm not sure who is suffering more though, the patrons or the server. It might be good if the latter understand the eightfold path to understand the nature of intentional action. Or maybe not."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2020-02-10,4,"We stopped by for a cup of coffee and desserts. It was on the pricey side but worth it. We had the french cream donut and chocolate mouse. Both were worth the calories. They don't have individual cup of coffee at the table, instead they have it on their menu as a pot of coffee. This can be split between 2 people. Next time we will have to try their food."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2020-01-04,4,"Great place for a work meeting, or lunch with a friend. There are many locations around the city though, so make sure you are aware of which location you are meeting someone so you don't show up at the wrong one (like I did once lol). The coffee is good, the tea is good, and they have a huge selection of treats and meals. Everything I've tried so far has been delicious. Service is ok, can be a bit slow at times. This location is across the street from a super famous Seinfeld episode- making it even more worth it to check out!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-12-05,1,"so basically they were out of the beetroot hummus, so instead of mentioning that they just put some weird other hummus. what if i had an allergy? then i mention it and the lady takes my food and walks away with it, not even sure why because when she returned it was exactly the same. the quinoa cake is half the size as normal. the chickpea ""salad"" was just  12 unseasoned chickpeas. the dressing was some pesto flavored dressing ive never had. so i make a complaint and the manager now picks my food up and walks away with it, bringing it back with no change, so when i mention i was eating it, he goes ""i was only gone for 5 seconds"" as if time mattered. all this while the staff sits behind the counter whispering while working about the situation i guess? 

this was really uncalled for, never had an issue at a le pain quo before, this is one of my favorite places to get lunch. 

instead of fixing the situation with new lunch, a free drink or pastry or like ANYTHING, he rudely kept saying they will refund me. a refund doesnt nourish me. now i am not only late to work, im late and HUNGRY with a bad mood due to this b.s.

the reviews for this particular store are pretty bad, maybe give an updated training here or something. these staff are not it and i normally praise the staff at other locations. really really unhappy."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-12-01,1,"I thought I would like this place because I've been to many of them. But actually we had an incredibly  rise waitress. She couldn't handle the amount of people that came through the doors so when I asked for water (yes more than once) she got annoyed. I had to ask the manager for the water and then miraculously they both brought water over right away. I split a smoked salmon plate with capers, someone else had dragon fruit smoothie and the waffle was by the last person (now that was an incredibly tiny waffle). I am actually going to contact management to discuss this with them. Why did I have to be the brunt of a surly waitress?"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-11-28,1,"The service was really really bad. Today is thanksgiving and thought would have a nice breakfast with my friend in this holiday. One female staff member was really rude to us, not sure why, since she seemed like to be friendly to everyone else. First thing first, it took her 10 mins to take my credit card even she saw us multiple times. Second, she left the credit card machine to our table before the payment was complete. And when later I gave her a friendly reminder that she could take the machine away, she put on a very mean face telling us"" it can be put there, do you need anything else?"" The whole time, she wasn't apologizing at all. Third, when she handed us the plate, she almost make my friend's coffee mug fall...

What an interesting meal. Would never come back and it kinda ruined my holiday vibes.

Bad!"

I love it though. Especially The Baker's Lunch which comes with a little of everything: soup, salad, avocado toast. 
The deserts are yummy too. 
There is a grab and go refrigerator right next to the baked goods/coffee counte
Otherwise you seat yourself and wait for wait staff to take your order. 
This place isn't slow exactly but it succeeds in slowing things down somehow. Something about the type of food and ambiance causes you to slow down your nyc big city pace which can be really lovely and necessary to do."

The brioche was really yummy and the combo of the perfectly cooked slightly runny egg and cheese and avocado and sauce was all great."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-11-15,1,"Terrible service.  Cold Chicken Melt, 1/2 hour wait, at 3:30 PM for a sandwich.  Fyi, the sandwich looked and tasted good, had it reheated."

I actually wanted a waiter to notice when we were seated; to pay attention when I ran out of water; and to be aware when we were done and wanted the check. Our waiter was ghost-like. We had to find him to order after a long wait and then he went AWOL after the food came. Had to go find someone behind the to go counter for our bill. 
Food is tasty. Creative menu. No one seems interested in bussing and cleaning tables--there were dirty ones all around. Crap service."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-09-04,1,Ordered the watermelon& feta salad to go. This must be some kind of joke?! There's literally one small piece of watermelon and a few feta crumbs in my salad. No avocado either. I can't believe I just spent more than $13 for this
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-09-01,1,This Le Pain Quotidien has consistently SLOW customer service. I'm consistently disappointed with how long it takes to be noticed upon arrival and taken care of during my meal experience. There is always a feeling when I'm there that they are understaffed !!! It deters me from going to this location as I know I will have to work to get noticed and served appropriately. It's sad as I adore Le Pain's in other locations.

But something has changed in the last few weeks.  During rush hour between 8-9am, there's only been one cashier. The line is long and there are less employees helping to make the beverages and serve the customers.  It seems like there's a shortage. 

Things were so great..  why change things? LPQ, you need to staff up during rush hour.  This is midtown!"

Lady at counter first refused to believe there was an app called Seamless... that allows you to order food. Hello?!! Next she refused to believe that LPQ allows ordering though Seamless. Hello?!!!

Jeez.

Wake up people, this is 2019. Yes, you can order food through an app. Yes, Seamless exists. And btw - it's a publicly traded company.

Management - please train your employees."

187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-02-28,4,"Stopped in for a cub of tea and a pastry!  Not a great selection, but it was 3:30pm, so understandable.   The atmosphere was pleasant and the service was very good.

I'm probably being generous with my rating, as nothing really stood out.   But a had such a relaxing tea, that generosity is warranted.  

I may come back a provide a more critiqued review...but from what i can see, you probably won't find anything that turns you off 

I would recommend this place"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-02-15,1,Le pain is actual pain. I got yelled at by an old lady. Soap tasted awful. I am sad. Instantly left here and got bacon chicken and waffles. Fuck your organic shit.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-02-02,4,"I like to meet up with my friend at this location because it is quieter than other places to have conversation. More so than the food, I really enjoy the relaxing ambiance and the convenient location of this place. The food, coffee and beverages I tried are all decent, but I didn't find it phenomenal. The service is quick and friendly, and I didn't feel rushed to move out even when it was approaching closing hours."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-01-19,5,"Phenomenal food! Excellent food combinations. Wow I'm blown away. I tried their Breakfast Sandwich which has organic egg, avocado and cheddar on a brioche roll with chipotle aioli, served with a seasonal salad. Was SO SO good. Avocado toast was on point. For the hipsters out there, it's both aesthetically pleasing food and tastebud pleasing food. Would recommend!!!!!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-01-05,1,"Go to this location Friday mornings. Over past year have found they open late at times even though it was 720AM, and opening is at 7a.
Lattes are not made with sufficient amount of foam. Slow service and yesterday was served with watered down oatmeal and hardly any bananas.  When being charged so much for oatmeal, I find this unacceptable. I will not be returning in the mornings to this location. Managers please check control of service at this location."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2019-01-04,5,"This chain restaurant has fresh, healthy food in a clean tranquil setting. We ordered soup and a sandwich. The bread is really delicious. Great place to grab a healthy breakfast or lunch!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-11-07,3,Service was slow and poor. Though friendly and warm environment. Menu is healthy and fancy. Bakery is good. The coffee was ok. I would skip it and find something else.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-08-26,5,"One of the nicest Le Pain Quotidien locations in the city.  Good atmosphere, easy to stay a while and work without being bothered. Ordered an almond milk latte and it was great"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-07-28,4,"Stopped by mid afternoon for a bit of a pick me up while walking around the city. 

Right off the bat, I loved the rustic yet clean decor that vibed both inside and outside (they have outside seating!). I thought the selections they had were typical of a ""health-conscious"" place, however I do wish that they kept the sit-down menus by the front door instead of the register- i think it would've been more tempted to go into the shut down area if I could see the menu first. 

I grabbed an açaí bowl from the grab-n-go section and  was pretty pleased with the amount of food in the bowl. The toppings were great and the price was also typical like other smoothie bowl places too."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-05-30,1,"The service is so bad and they turns out to be racial discrimination, the man on the counter is unfriendly to our family and the manager in charge would not do anything about it while they cheated me for spending over 300 dollars for the breakfast and do not even apologize for their attitude and told us it is against the law to deal with it ! I highly suggest people should not come to the restaurant anymore."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-05-25,3,"We stopped here based on other yelp reviews.  Place was clean but man, they were slammed.  Waiter brought the wrong iced tea and was slow to replenish. I understand, they were slammed, and the place was small, but this was a little frustrating. I ordered the smoked mozzarella chicken melt and it was good.  We also ordered the spicy tomato soup and that too was yummy.  Waiter was great in suggesting we split a large instead of ordering two smalls.  Good on him.  Not sure I'd come back but the food was good.  $55 tab, two sandwiches, two drinks and a bowl of soup is a touch much."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-04-29,1,"Horrible service! I ordered delivery and they sent the wrong order. Then wouldn't pick up the phone so I had to go in person to get it fixed. My order was for yogurt + berries, and they gave me a cup filled only 1/3rd with barely any yougurt and only 2-3 berries in it, all for $8!! Never going there ever again!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-04-24,3,"I came here on a Thursday around noon before the lucnh rush hit. Our waitress was very slow with getting back to us after our initial greeting and kept on being slow the rest of our time there. I understood once it picked up, which it did when we had been there for a while, but she only had one other table when we first sat down.

The food was good, but the portions were really small. Me and my friend both ordered a breakfast bowl and were both underwhelmed. We both left the place still hungry, which should not be the case after spending $15 dollars on just the food. 

The coffee was all right, but not great. Overall the experience left both me and my friend wanting something else."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-04-21,4,"Nice casual spot for breakfast.
The ricotta prosciutto and fig Sammie was okay - I would have preferred warm.
His croissant sandwich looked great.
Clean restrooms.

Recommended."

The service is lacking. I walked out yesterday as no one greeted me after I had been seated. Staff were not busy just walked by. 
I went back today at a different time.  I was served but it took forever to get the check."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-04-16,5,"Very very fresh ingredients and such a welcoming environment! An open space with great soft music and relaxing tunes. Love the choices they offer here. Overall, a great place to visit for a quick breakfast or coffee!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-04-03,2,Overall: meh. My ham and cheese croissant and chai latte were cold and the salad was underdressed. My friend's Belgian waffle was tiny (and really expensive for the portion size). The only high point to this experience was the service.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-04-01,5,"Our best find so far near Central Park! Just the type of food we love. I had steel cut oats with fresh berries with hot water, lemon , honey and ginger. It felt good on my sore throat. My husband had the turmeric hot drink with butternut squash frittata. Both were excellent!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-03-22,5,"Cozy and comfortable place.  The staff are friendly, I love a avocado toast. It
 Is testy and fresh."

The service was good, not exceptional but we would come back because the server was so kind and the food was fantastic!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-02-18,1,Very poor service on a Sunday afternoon. The server left us alone for almost an hour without checking in or offering us anything. Not friendly and very slow poor service. Very disappointing! I don't recommend this place.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-02-15,2,"One of my first days at my new job, I stopped into this location and had a yeasted donut filled with whipped cream. It was delicious! I try not to have bread and sugar for breakfast, so I didn't have it again until today. I was just in the mood for something sweet and stopped in to get another. It was GROSS. I opened the bag to find a burned donut that squeezed out oil with every bite. DISGUSTING. It cost nearly $5 and I have had better donuts at Dunkin. Never going to crave this donut again!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-02-04,3,"The atmosphere is lovely, the server was observant and efficient. The English Breakfast tea and coffee were right on point, and I highly recommend this location for a clean-eating breakfast or a quick baked good from their grab-and-go section.

The Belgian waffle is excellent, but small if you are expecting it to be plate-sized. The oatmeal is perfect, although they added flax seeds which were not on the menu description, and while that was a delightful surprise for my dining companion, it may be concerning to those with allergies. 

I had the Salmon and soft boiled egg dish; it was adequate, but not worth $15. The menu described capers, but instead there were scallions. I asked for the ricotta to be held and it was, but there was unexpected bread instead. I appreciate the attempt to fill my plate...? But I don't eat bread, so this was a waste. 

Just make sure you check that your expectations match what is being served today."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-01-13,2,"Terrible costumer service. Avocado toast are burned to death. My latte looked like has floating clouds on it.  
For a chain like LPQ I would expect much more!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2018-01-02,5,Perfect little spot for a warm breakfast on a cold day. I snuggled into a table this morning and had the Sunny Side Breakfast Bowl and coffee. Coffee cups without handles = warm hands. The flavor of the dish and the coffee were spot-on. Definitely recommend if you have time to sit for a moment.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-12-09,1,"I ordered from seamless from this location and they 
A. Forgot one of my items 
B. Sent me the wrong quiche 
C. The person that answered called the seamless driver an idiot and told me they were too busy to bother trying to make me a new order 

I love Le Pain and always buy their food from different locations but this was the worst posible encounter I've had with them. It took me about 5 calls to finally get some sort of answer and to get a refund. They said they would give me one but I guess I'll wait and see if I get it. 

Horrible, horrible!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-11-16,4,"Croissants, butter, jam, strong coffee.  Does it get any better?  Well it does at this busy, but welcoming branch of the PQD chain.  Interesting egg dishes, seasonal specialties, and granola-laced fresh yogurt.  Credit waitresses like Aissatou for bringing a warm smile to every customer she greets and making this a very special place to say 'good morning.'"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-10-14,2,"The restaurant distinguishes itself by its poor service. Takes too long for someone to take your order. Takes equally as long for them to give you the check. I've eaten here a few times (mainly because it's just about the only restaurant which is fine with a vegan friend of mine), and only once was the service good. The other issue from a service standpoint, is that the waitresses are about as apathetic as you can get. The menu is too limited to my tastes. Speaking of which, the food is fair, nothing great, nothing horrible. It's a surprise to me they get as much business as they do."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-09-15,5,"I was here today and i come here a lot in between classes i always get good service and i tip well. i mean you get what u pay after all this is not fine dinning its more of a casual dinning, however the prices for simple stuff are a bit too over priced i gotta admit to that but hey its nyc i guess.. reason why im giving 5 stars is because of the waitress today her names is Jonnita she was very attentive and was lovely i don't usually expect this kind of service in casual dinning thats why i appreciate her service def will be coming back as usual.."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-09-12,4,"The coconut macaroon and apple tart are consistently great.  

The cream donut looked promising, but unfortunately was a  tasteless miss.

Not sure anything else is worth buying, but the macaroon and apple tart will keep me coming back."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-09-03,2,"The atmosphere is adorable. We love how quaint it is. But we had to wait a while to be served and helped. The waiter and waitress also were not very personable. They seem almost angry and never smile. 

I had the croissant sandwiches and hot cocoa. It tasted great, but the sandwich wasn't very warm. My hubs had the skillet eggs with salmon. It was not good. The eggs were plasticky and overlooked. Very sad. 

I'd stick with a drink and bread if I came again. 

We are still waiting to pay our bill...they just aren't a faced paced place at all. We've had our card out waiting for 10 minutes. I finally had to ask the waiter."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-08-26,1,"So I've been to LPQ before and always found it expensive for what you get but I like going there sometimes because of the ambiance. This time, however, the food was horrible and almost inedible - no amount of ambiance could justify the price now. Ordered a salmon tartine, it was like chewing gum. All sinew - you couldn't even cut through any of it. The avocado tasted like slimy lemon and that's it. The croquet Monsieur had one piece of ham and some cheese that covered less than half of the bread. All this for more than $15 each. 

Go here for pastries that are pre made but good god don't go here for the food. It's NYC, if you can't find food that is better than this, you deserve chewing on your food for minutes on end."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-08-17,2,"Go to the Central Park south location, not this one. Terrible service - the staff do not care at all and you will wait 10minutes to order a coffee even if it's empty. I went on a summer day and the inside of the restaurant was hotter than outside and they wouldn't turn up the AC. I won't be going back to this location."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-07-28,4,Service is good but a bit slow.  Very healthy options and nice decor. Outside sitting was nice.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-07-27,3,I ordered breakfast to go and they took 15 minutes to make the oatmeal. It wasn't made correctly. The service is really slow and they couldn't get the order right. Try pret if you're looking for a quick bite.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-07-21,2,Terrible service... it appears that the waitresses are a few to the size of the restaurant and number of tables.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-07-15,3,"Came in here for a quick iced tea while walking around the city. It literally took 20 minutes to get an iced. tea. to. go. 

The place was very cute and had people in eating lunch at the time. But the gentlemen that served us at the to go counter was clearly not interested in getting us our drinks anytime soon. 

I would come back, but I think this is important to take note."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-06-24,5,Consistent every time. It's so good. Service is fast and good. Love this chain. The menu might need a little updating but he pastries are solid and the coffee offerings are as well.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-06-04,5,"Service is great, love this place. I stop in here often. French cream donut is the best.  Great for a catch up with friends."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-05-06,1,Worst service ever. The hostess Marcia in the front is rude for no reason and walks away when your talking to her. Next time taking my money elsewhere.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-04-26,5,"Do NOT understand the strange ratings. I've eaten coast to coast in all the trendy restaurants with celebrity chefs etc etc etc. Great place for a quick bite and just to relax.  Don't disregard the fresh components. Le Pain Quotidien has multiple locations and so helpful when going to the theatre before or after. :)  Hit this place in the middle of the last big snow storm. Just a nice warm welcoming place with great service. Shout out to avocado toast with salmon...but the bread...wow, the texture and flavor are amazing. Came back the next day as well. And then, 4 days later came and purchased tons of bakery and take home for the hotel. Family goes  here every year. Also frequented Maison Kayser of the same vein, but prefer this."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-04-23,3,"Things are reinvented for the worst at this place. 
Seasonal frittata was eggs with peas: quiche consistency and tasteless. Belgium waffle tasted like scone batter: doughy, cake feel inside. Both dishes were not bad but far from what they should be. Maybe the should have different names. 
The waffle was served on a flat cheese board, making difficult to eat, blueberry simply rolled out of the plate. Bowls for coffee, not a good idea. The coffee was cold right away. 
Service was poor. The servers ran back and forth, looking overwhelmed and our server never stopped by after she brought the food. I had to ask someone else to please get me the ticket after a long wait."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-04-14,5,"So last time I was here, I was completely frustrated. I've worked in the service industry on and off for about 14 years and, needless to say, I was disappointed in the service at this location.

I wrote my review and spoke with a manager, who's name escapes me, but she was amazing. She said if I was willing to give them another chance, lunch was on her and she handed me a sticky note with her signature and of course I lost it.

Fast forward to this afternoon, I walked in and immediately spoke with the manager at the front, a very helpful gentleman. I explained I was offered a lunch but didn't have the paper with me and he immediately checked in the back. A few minutes later I was seated and already enjoying my espresso.

I work up the street from here as a barber, I have clients asking where to grab a bite and meetings of my own with colleagues that I'd love to bring here. I was always hesitant because of the super slow service but today changed my mind completely. Everyone was attentive, and I'm sure some of it had to do with the fact that I was returning for a lunch on them, but it wasn't strained and they were kind/helpful. 

Glad I came back and gave this location another chance, it shows great customer service to invite a client back and impress them the way I was today."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-04-14,5,"I can't tell you how confused I am by the negative comments regarding the service at this location. Out of all the LPQ's I've dined at, I find this one to be the most warm, friendly and attentive. The team at LPQ on 55th is tight knit, run by a gracious manager who always has a smile on her face, and will do anything to support her staff. The food is always on point, and the atmosphere is relaxed... where as other locations feel like a cafeteria where you are being rushed out. 

I would like to give a big thank you to the staff and Lakisha at LPQ on 55th. You truly made my grandmother's and my time in Manhattan brighter, and helped us start our days on the right foot. I can't wait to come back. 

5 stars across the board."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-04-13,2,"Always good food - fresh, healthy, decent portions.

My review is in regards to the service here, which is consistently lacking. From prior reviews, although management seems to acknowledge this as an issue, it clearly isn't being addressed.

I've been here multiple times as its close to my office, and each time the servers have been oblivious to their patrons, myself included. Every service item takes longer than it should: menus are not provided in a timely manner, food and drink is not delivered on time (I've had to ask more than once, and I've noticed others do the same), and once you are served, there's little to no follow up. 

What I have noticed is the servers congregating around the server stand, where orders are entered into the system and checks calculated.

To LPQ management - please just be aware that your servers seem to be more interested in socializing among themselves than they are to their patrons waiting patiently around them. Everyone was nice, just no attention paid."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-04-09,1,"I have always enjoyed going Le pain Quotidien all the times in NYC.But today(April 9th 2017) I had such a bad experience from Le pain Quotidien (55th Street & 8th ave)When we get there in the breakfast, I noticed there were lots of customers in the morning.I am sure they must be busy to serve all the customers in the early morning.
But, We've been waited to be seated, but no one came to us for 5mins. we felt really awkard.
Even one waitress saw us, and just passed us. They didn't even say hi or say something to be 
waited! So we decided to seat one of their table where all left over dishes on.They didn't clean those dishes until we literally called waitress.
after that still, No waitress has been showed to get order for 30mins. We def felt people work there giving us silence treatment intentionally,  Me, my baby and my wife decided to leave, after no one asked us to get order. I looked back in anger but then they still didn't even come to us apologies and anything. This really made me mad. 2 ladies who worked there saw us we were leaving but they didn't even care! I have been gone to Le Pain Quotidien other location for many times, They always have been friendly but the location I went today, they never been friendly. Just want youguys know those waitress need to get trained better there for quality assurance, I hope I am the only one complained about that location! But i guess i am not the only one. Thanks."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-03-26,2,Horrible service!  Our food came out with our drinks.  Waited 20 mins for a waitress to acknowledge us.  Food was great.  Service was horrible!!!

187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-01-20,1,"Service is very bad: waiters even dont say hi.
I ordered salmon breakfast for 17$ and had 4 huge pieces of not fresh bread and salmon with one boiled egg. Asked to add some greens or even something...no suggestions! I add avocado for 3,5$ and had 1/4 of it on the side....
So my breakfast with coffee cost me 26$ which should be max 12!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2017-01-04,4,"As the Duke of Le Pain Quotidien I feel it is my duty to represent it with utmost dignity and honesty.

France recently announced a new law related to emails which has plastered headlines as: France bans work email after work (http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/04/heres-another-reason-move-france-no-after-work-emails/96148338/). Le Pain Quotidien gives off a similar vibe. You walk into the restaurant and people are just lounging. They're sipping on small little cups of coffee. The waitresses and waiters are smiling at you and awaiting you to beckon them over. If you looked closely, I bet you'd notice that even the bread rises slower.

I've order two things here that were delicious:

1 - The Baked Eggs. This was perfectly baked into a small metal pot. The eggs came out in a perfect consistency and almost congealed to the sides of the dish. When you break into it with a spoon, sauces swirl into the indentation that your utensil has just left.

2 - The warm goat cheese salad. This seems like a pretty standard goat cheese salad with vinaigrette, walnuts, and goat cheese but the twist is that the goat cheese is baked onto 4 pieces of bread in the salad. This makes the cheese slightly harder on the outside with a warm gushy center - almost like a toasted marshmallow if you will.

Anyways so far I've hit 2 / 2 for good foods at LPQ. As I probably should've known though, the wait to get my check afterwards has always been a little bit slower than I hoped, and the food just slightly pricier than one would expect. So if you're looking for a kind of a French pain - LPQ is the place for you."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-12-22,2,"I've been to a number of different Pain Quotidien locations (Washington D.C., Sydney ,Australia).    We went to this particular location twice because it was near our hotel.  The food at PQ is generally very good.  We were disappointed on the second visit when they were out of oatmeal (which is usually really good.)  Also unlike the other locations they only had soft-boiled eggs, no scrambled which seems weird. The bread was hard and seemed stale.  Both times the service was very slow (and they weren't particularly crowded) and just bad.  We had to go find a waiter to take our order after sitting a long time.  

Is this the norm now for all PQs or is it just New York?"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-11-18,1,"I work next door in the same building as this place.  The customer service here is a disgrace, today I walk in to buy a croissant, so I pick it up and walk 2 feet to the cash register, there are 4 people behind the counter chatting up and/or doing other work not paying me any mind or attention so I wait a few more minutes and no one is even stepping into ring me up so then I leave.  This is the 3rd time this has happened to me at this location so it is evident that management either doesn't care or is doing a lousy job training people to have basic customer service skills.  Not only did they lose a sale today but I will just go across the street from now on to get my sandwiches.  I'm sure my loss of business is not hurting them but this place needs to step up its game."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-10-22,2,"The service was ""le pain"" in my ass. Had to wait like 15 minutes for anyone to take out order. Waited for 20 minutes for a Greek yoghurt. It was brought to the table in a tall glass which made it quite hard to eat it.

Other plates came to the table pretty fast and food in general was ok. Waited for another 15 for someone to bring the check. Ended up just leaving the money on the table since no one came with the bill. Really poor service."

The latest issue with this cafe is the sign that clearly states ""seat yourself"" on the patio. Seeing others outside I do as the sign invites. After 10 minutes of no service I go inside and let them know I'm outside. The employee looks at me and says ""no service outside today""

Seriously!?!?!  I'm done, won't be back to any locations. The food is ok but very limited in selection but this continued lack of service is not ok!!!!"

(Being a French cafe you think they would have some) The only egg options offered were soft boiled eggs. That being said, coffee was great, ricotta cheese and smoked salmon were delicious. Service was also great. 8/10. Would recommend."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-08-08,4,I love this place! The ambience is pretty chill. Food is good however the portions are pretty small. I ordered the waffle and got one that was half of the size of my hand.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-08-04,1,I have been going to this place since it opened. No more! The service is very bad-rude attitudes and totally inefficient.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-07-27,1,"It looks great from outside but I am trying to erase this experience from my mind. We came here for breakfast and the warm interiors invited us in. The menu contains a selection of french and american offerings. The smashed avocado on toast was very small for the price and the toast was hard as a rock, not great. The muesli was awfully stodgy and no amount of milk could fix it. Coffee was pretty bad. I've since discovered this is a chain, and it shows no love."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-07-25,2,"Disappointed by this location, the salad had a lot of bad leaves, the bread was terribly dry and only one waitress outside (doing her best but would definitely need more staff). I had to leave before I could hope for a water refill too, really not ideal with this weather and being 8 months pregnant! I will definitely pick Kayser nearby next time!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-07-25,2,"Meh indeed.  Have you ever gone to a Panera bread for lunch but thought to yourself: ""This is nice, but I wish the portions were smaller, the food had less flavor, and it cost about three times as much.""  VOILA.  Your dreams have become reality.  Welcome to Le Pain Quotidien.  Now I know we are talking about Midtown Manhattan here, but I've been to locations elsewhere, and I foolishly forgot how overpriced this chain of cafes is and how it is not even remotely worth it in terms of quality.  The people working here are nice enough and it's clean and all of that, but yeah, incredibly over-priced and really bland and really not that special.  At least for lunch.  Maybe it's better for breakfast, but those open-faced sandwiches are a joke.  The bread isn't very good, and there are a hundred of better spots for similar food around.  Hell, go to Pret a Manger and you'll be a lot happier for a fraction of the price."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-06-08,4,"Glad they have one close to me now! They even have out door seating w/h would be great for breakfast/brunch. Food and pastries are pretty good.

Today, I went in to grab a loaf of my favorite multigrain bread- they slice it in the machine if you ask. I complimented a pretty young girl named Lucy on her pair of eyeglasses, w/h I really liked the style. She was so sweet and pleasant at the register."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-05-01,2,"Honestly I've never liked this chain that much and this location doesn't help.

Sat down on Sunday afternoon. There place wasn't busy, there were about 4 staff members. I waited 20 minutes for a latte and a butter brioche, which requires NO preparation. The bread was very mediocre - I could get something similar or better for much cheaper at a grocery store. Lol. The latte isn't great either, not necessarily strong but very bitter."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-04-13,5,"I visited New York and was told I had to eat here,this place is amazing. First of all its very clean and the staff was amazing. The menu had a wide variety of great food,we chose just a simple chicken soup it was delicious.  Overall our dining experience was great and plan on eating here while im in town more often."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-03-17,3,"Super delish, like all Le Pain Quotidiens, but seriously terrible service."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-03-13,4,"Food was delish! Service was meh/not attentive. We had to flag them down several times for forgotten items. We had the chicken soup, oatmeal and waffles (came at brunch). Nice decor/clean. On the pricier side for lunch but higher quality ingredients."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-03-03,5,"Seldom do we stop at a restaurant without checking with Yelp. After our happy hour I was famished,  so popped in with the hopes of finding something that would agree with my fussy digestive tract. We were greeted by Denise , a warm and lovely young lady with a terrific smile. She recommended the gluten free sandwich with avocado. To be quite honest, it was one of the best I have had anywhere! I am actually salivating as I am writing this and may go back for another . My husband had a sandwich with chicken but before I could find out about it , he had already inhaled it. A few minutes later we were greeted by Danka and her staff,  friendly as can be! First day in New York City was just terrific ! Thank you"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-01-31,5,"What a beautiful location! Since the opening, I've been to this location a dozen times and each experience is better than the previous. I'm in love with the seasonal changes to the menu this go around and the staff(!) are some of the most gracious and competent staff in any NYC restaurant. The last time I was there, my server noticed my salad was a little dry and offered to bring by a side of dressing. Actually, the salad was perfect for my tastes...but talk about attention to detail! 

I was bothered to see another reviewer on here make claims that the servers couldn't speak English (when her own review was composed in broken English and used very poor grammar!) and express disappointment that the menu wasn't the same as California's. Frankly, that is one of the things I really appreciate about LPQ: regionally and seasonally specific menus! And each server there is nothing short of model professionalism and competency. 

Keep up the good work LPQ 55th Street! You've won me over!!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-01-31,1,"The service was really bad , the staff are not trained hardly speak english , not nice not pleasant, the salad was cold and not fresh , they don't serve half of the order , give breakfast ( bread basket etc) with no plate , we approached the manager she tried to help but never offered any gesture . Ruined my morning !! 
Plus they don't serve the same menus like in California 
Huge disappointment!"
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2016-01-28,5,"Charming, delicious, and cozy.  Hits all the marks.  The Belgium waffle was excellent."
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2015-12-19,2,Maybe because is new but the experience wasn't like all the other location in town! Sorry but need a training.
187,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-141,2015-12-11,5,Excellent food and excellent service. I had the Quiche Lorraine and it was absolutely scrumptious. Highly recommend.
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2020-02-20,1,"I frequent this location because it's convenient to where I need to be. I have never been to any other Dunkin that tries so hard to upsell. It's actually pushy, and so off-putting. They try to get me to buy something more than what I order every single visit, without fail. When I politely decline, they'll often try to suggest something different. Honestly, I'd rather walk a little farther to a different location that doesn't so obviously look at me like a walking dollar bill."
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2019-09-26,4,"Excellent customer service from a friendly counter employee. Only trouble I had was I needed to buy five munchkins. Uptown they will sell me one! Maybe things changed. I went ahead and got an old fashioned for $1.43. Must have been a Senior Discount because at first she said $1.59. 

There's easy access to free WiFi and an electric plug under the seat. I'm resting and having an unhealthy snack. 

This place is busy with people on their way to work. They handled the line quickly. People entered and exited with ease. I was the only one sitting at the counter to eat. I'm recommending this DD if you're nearby. The Queensborough Bridge is above you, Roosevelt Island Tram too. Most importantly across the street is TJ Maxx!"
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2019-04-10,1,"I love Dunkin but this LOCATION is horrible. Really REALLY bad service. Cashier didn't seem like he has any clue what he was doing. 

And after I ordered my iced latte. He just stood there. And the other employee was busy stacking slices of cheese on the counter .."
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2017-03-26,1,Vile thin coffee. Also they insist on adding cream and sugar themselves. They put cream in both coffees I ordered without asking and both were loaded with sugar even though I told them I wanted one black. Didn't realize until back in our hotel. Dumped both coffees.
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2017-02-03,3,"Heard a radio commercial this morning (2.2.17) for the chocolate cherry donut for Valentine's Day. After a long work day, I was walking by this D&D, & thought I'd just SEE what this donut looked like, after all, we are talking chocolate & cherry. Ok, so I caved in about a minute, when the guy told me there was ""jelly"" filling, but it is not ""jelly"", it is ""cherry"" filling inside the donut. And there is chocolate icing on the top of this HEART-SHAPED DONUT, with thin pink icing squiggled across. Cost: about $1.30.  Yes, folks, a donut in the less than $3-range!  See my photos.  

This is a regular donut dough, heart-shaped donut, w/cherry filling inside, & chocolate icing on top & thin pink icing squiggled across the top of that chocolate icing.  It is NOT A CHOCOLATE DONUT. Would look nice for Valentine's Day, or just an impromptu celebration. 

***Note: cherry filling is NOT the same as ""jelly donut"" filling. I would describe cherry filling as, cherry-flavored, red, almost pourable filling, smooth, with no pulp, or cherry pieces.  So, if you heated up cherry preserves, so they were just a little bit thick, filtered out any cherry pieces, that is how I would describe this filling. I might have tasted something that made me think there were chemical-type preservatives in it, though. And, to be very clear--""chemical-type preservatives"" are not the same as fresh, fruit preserves.  LOL.  This is probably the reason I'm satisfied with my one-time purchase. Hey, remember, Upon entry to this Dunkin' Donuts to just 'SEE' the donut, I did cave! And I bought one. So, for me, it's not the best donut I ever had, but I'm glad I tried it, it was fun.  

Some of the Dunkin Donuts just don't taste like the FRESH, Dunkin' Donuts I remember as a kid, a gazillion years ago. 

**If you know of a Dunkin Donuts who makes them FRESH, please message me & tell me where it is. Thanks! 

My favorite part was the chocolate icing! 
I'm glad I tried this donut; I satisfied a craving, and now I don't need to have this again for a while. For me, I'll spend my calories elsewhere. 

Regarding service at the store--I think they try to be helpful, but, as one Yelp reviewer wrote/said-- & I agree, I do not feel the folks in this store know anything much about donuts, vs French Crullers, vs proper types of fillings. I feel like everyone here should have a review, with photos, of what they are selling.

A few months ago, I wanted a corn muffin. It was my Work /Job busy, hectic season, and my co-workers and I were all feeling fatigued. I just wanted a comforting cup of camomile tea at home, with a warm corn muffin, with butter & jelly. Several stores were out of them, my last attempt was this Dunkin Donuts shop. Be still my heart! They had 2!!! I was paying for them, the young woman put them in one small brown bag, and did not fold the top of the bag down a few times. The bag was open at the top. She did not look at the counter carefully enough. Oooh, the importance of having an unobstructed counter!!! Darnnnnnnn!!!!!! The bag rolled off the counter and fell on the floor! One of the two corn muffins rolled out!! It was now in the floor!  She said she was sorry. I couldn't say anything. I was so tired, so exhausted, I almost felt like crying, yeah, I said that...all I wanted, after a 10.5 hour work day, was that corn muffin...I had thought, oh, goody, one for breakfast! But, I told myself, at least you still have one. We said goodnight, she & I, but, I wondered if she was going to toss that muffin, or put it back on the shelf. It should have been tossed immediately. That did not happen. I think everyone in this store could use some training. It is the reason I don't go in here much."
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2016-10-26,5,"Simple, efficient DD location.

THERE IS WIFI & USB Outlets to charge your phone, as well as a wall plug.

Very Friendly owner/manager at this location, more so than many DD's. 

Food quality is solid for this type of establishment. 

You can get a variety of breakfast sandwhiches here (made with real food) that's cheaper than starbucks (also a solid choice) yet still good. And of course the donuts, coffee, juice, tea, and ""coolatta"" smoothies.

DD has improved their menu selection on the whole.

Come here and order some food. There's some seating if need be. Only one outlet with some usb charging, but an adapter would expand this."
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2016-02-29,3,"Small DD shop, but it does the job. Stopped by to get a chocolate glazed donut and hot coffee. I must say, they do keep their donuts fresh."
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2015-10-05,1,"Disgusting!!!

I came here on Friday, 10/2/15, and saw two workers outside throwing out the garbage from the basement. I stood inside with no one else working except for the two handling garbage. 

After standing there for about 3 minutes, I decided to leave and go elsewhere but as I was about to open the door, the female worker stopped me and asked me if she could help me?

I walked back to the counter and she ran behind the counter. I stared at her as she was handling things behind the register without washing her hands. She eventually realized why I was just staring without saying a word and ran to the sink to wash her hands - she asked me again how can she help me?

I ordered a medium hazelnut coffee with milk and sugar and continued watching her as she didn't use soap and then went to dry her hands on paper towels and then on her apron. 

I was disgusted and wanted to complain as I saw the other worker come in, head to the sink and wash his hands thoroughly with soap and water. I asked if he could make my drink instead and they didn't understand why I wouldn't take the already made drink so I just left. 

I've seen some gross things before but how do you handle garbage and not wash your hands thoroughly for the sake of your own hygiene??"
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2015-08-29,3,"It's a small store with minimal seating, but it does the trick. I'm a huge fan of DD's iced coffee. I often stop in just for the coffee. They also make really good breakfast sandwiches. This one was nice because they offered me the option of the amount of milk and sugar in the iced coffee. I prefer less milk, standard sugar. Tastes the best. 

In addition, I got the French cruller. I feel like it should be a bigger donut, but alas, it was gone in 2 bites."
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2015-07-09,3,"This is a decent little DD nestled in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge and it's not awful.  Service was fast and friendly, they got my order right and the place was clean.

They don't have as many donuts as my usual DD but for an iced coffee and a choco cake donut, this place performs well."
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2015-06-17,4,"This is one of the cleanest and friendliest DDs I've ever seen in the city. The seating area wasn't covered in filth and the employees actually smiled and said ""you're welcome"" to my ""thank you""! It's true that the selection isn't quite as robust as the larger locations, but if I'm just stopping in for a quick (chips ahoy, omfg) iced coffee on the way to wherever, it's perfect."
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2015-06-02,2,"a typical dd that serves a purpose in the morning time and for folks on the go to and from work. the place is tiny but some side counter seating if you want to stay inside. not the best selection of donuts and bagels, but the basic should be good enough. they have egg sandwiches, flatbreads and other sandwiches for lunch time but its mostly donuts wi
 hot and cold coffee beverages. its all the same decor inside and out as any dd around and its located on 60th st and 1st ave. was in  the area waiting for buddy who was  walking across the 59 th st bridge( cheap bastard will not even spend on train fare). the place is clean enough, not much to keep clean place is tiny, i decided on a large lemonade which is not bad at all, very underrated in my book but it go's downhill from there, the jelly donut had so much powdered sugar flying all over the place ( mostly on me ( and a little bit of  untasty jelly in the middle , and the old fashion donut was so dry it belong in the sahara. when back in the day when  double d made all the donuts on premises , you would hardly get a bad donut. oh how i long for the good old donut days, skip this spot and dont disturb the workers while they are texting away."
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2014-11-10,2,"For a limited time, Dunkin Donut has introduced their very own ""cronut"" - Croissant Donut. I had high hopes because this small donut cost me 2.69$!

Flaky exterior but totally ruined by the sweet glaze coating. The inside tastes nothing different from a donut. As a donut, it is quite good, but as a ""cronut"" it still needs work.

It is limited edition, so when they sell out for the day, they won't remake. It is worth the try, but don't be surprised, it is at most just a good donut."
188,dunkin-new-york-69,2013-08-31,1,"Stopped by this outpost while in the neighborhood (it just opened) and had the most frustrating experience.

First off, a VERY small selection of offerings as they do not bake on the premises.
Second, the staff knows a smattering of English and is unfamiliar with the product and can't read the labels.
I asked for a French Cruller and she reaches for a Vanilla Glazed with Sprinkles. Took me 5 minutes for play navigator (up, down, to the left, to the right) with the sales woman and she stood bewildered starring at the small selection of stale (yes, they do not throw out old donuts at outposts now) baked good in front of her.
Lastly, although I commend these people for purchasing and opening a franchise, please learn your product well and offer the BEST customer service. You opened a well known doughnut/coffee outpost RIGHT ACROSS the street of a well established Starbuck's.  Don't think that just because you own a well known franchise, that you can rest on it's name. Dunkin' Donuts are starting to pop up all over the place like Subway did.

You're probably better off purchasing a doughnut maker at Bed Bath and Beyond also across the street and make fresh at home for less."
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2020-05-08,5,"They're always so nice! I love how they give me options if they're out of an ingredient, so sometimes I'll leave with a unique drink :)
(I dunno why it says I'm in CA, I definitely live in NY lol)"
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2020-01-13,2,"Easily the slowest Starbucks I've ever been to. Anytime I order ahead through the app, the drinks take 12-15 minutes to be prepared (including iced chai, black coffee), and the employees are annoyed when I ask if they've received it. It's a large space, so it's got that going for it I guess."
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2019-10-26,2,Consistently the slowest and least professional Starbucks I've ever been to. No idea why they can't get it together...
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2019-10-18,2,"Generally the employees here are nice, positive mood and helpful. However I have had continuous problems with the order ahead feature and the fact that they usually never open on time! This is literally the closest starbucks to me and I always look forward to getting a morning cup. We all know how time is of essence here in NYC so any minute counts. When the order ahead is ""down"" and the store not open yet after taking time and walking there.. it's very disappointing. I saw about 3 other people attempt their morning coffee only to be greeted by locked doors and employees setting up."
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2019-09-10,1,Correct me if I am wrong but don't think it's a standard procedure for Starbucks to turn the lights off 30 min before the closing time when customers are still in the shop
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2019-09-05,3,"The largest Starbucks close to John Jay College, but with its smattering of AC plugs and ridiculously loud music, not a place to linger. The loud music is pervasive company-wide and purposeful. Starbucks simply doesn't want anyone to stay and drink coffee in peace. 

Full of grade school kids but since most of them are just there to hang with the few actually ordering, the line looks worse than it actually is. 

Also no restroom. Serve a diuretic and then not offer facilities. It's not like they didn't have the space. 

All three stars are for the staff's good customer service skills. Everything else reinforces why I have come to dislike Starbucks."
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2019-09-05,1,I waited for an hour for my drink they were rude to me and when I politely asked when it would be ready I was told to act my age they've forgotten my stuff multiple times
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2019-09-05,1,I have waited here for an hour for my drink and it still hasn't come. The  are workers are rude and useless. DO NOT COME HERE
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2019-07-10,5,6:30pm I've had too much coffee and wasn't in the mood of buying anything to eat or drink. But I've been out since 6am. I asked if I had to buy anything to use their restroom and they said no. That was such a wonderful relief and I appreciate the wonderful courtesy.
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2019-07-01,5,Perfect Starbucks for grabbing a quick coffee or chilling for several hours. There's plenty of natural light and a handful of plugs scattered throughout. I live a few blocks away and this isn't the closest Starbucks to my apartment - but I'll usually make the trek here because - as Starbucks go - this is one of their better NYC locations.
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2019-03-23,5,"For a surreal people-watching experience come to this Starbucks. Birkin bag moms, Soul Cycle devotees, Airbnb transients, and wealthy foreign real estate buyers of the surrounding glass monoliths all congregate here. It resembles a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Well, at least a Where's Waldo. To say nothing of the spillover of children from the neighboring schools. At times you'd think it was a makeshift daycare. The staff deserves a round of applause. I don't know how they keep their patience. With the calamity than can ensue, I'm amazed that they've consistently gotten my order correct. If you're looking for a nice, quiet Starbucks I hear there's one up in Tarrytown you'd love. If you want to watch humanity brew show up to this spot for a cup of joe."
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2019-03-22,2,"Honestly, not my favorite Starbucks but the one closest to me... I've been here a couple of times and regardless of the personal, their drinks don't seem to be as good as other Starbucks locations.

They have improved the service, the amount of baristas they have in store also proved but I wasn't satisfied and my boyfriend wasn't either when we came to get two caramel macchiatos and they didn't have any flavor. It had no caramel and didn't seem to have expresso either.

I have to say that I've been satisfied with what I ordered and received once, twice would be too much, out of 5 times or more that we have visited this store.

I am definitely not a hard customer, but they are definitely not a good Starbucks store, at least not yet."
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2019-02-06,1,"The store lets dogs (not service dogs) sit on the floors, chairs tables and benches. They block the path and often lick the tables and counter where milk is located. I was told that dogs have urinated on the floor
I have complained and . Other customers have complained as well but nothing has been done. It's a simple solution: Post a sign in the door and then ENFORCE the policy."
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2018-12-10,5,Great spacious area! Good for study and hanging out. It's not overly crowded as well. Staff are nice and get you coffee in a jiffy!
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2018-11-20,3,"When I first noticed this Starbucks popping up on the Upper West Side I was super excited! My normal location of choice is the spacious location at 57th &10th ave. This location would be much more convenient for me!

Obviously, everyone else in this neck of the woods thought the same thing. This location, on the occasions I have visited, is always packed and crowded. It is a fairly compact location, but still equipped with all the starbucks swag, mugs, items you could want to purchase. Seating is average, but outlets are scarce. More of a place to sit and read the newspaper than to sit and do work. Pretty high traffic area easily visible from West End and across from a M57 bus stop.

There are many times that I have decided just to order a basic coffee as opposed to an expresso drink because I was not confident in the speed/accuracy of the drink-making process. It is not necessarily the baristas' fault, but they get inundated with mobile orders which have times(deadlines) associated with them. I am going to start (if I remember) to order ahead for pickup which may be better for this location.

Overall a solid Starbucks in a location of need for a quick caffeine fix, but for relaxation and working I would still prefer a different starbucks location"
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2018-09-12,4,"This Starbucks is a hit or miss depending on who makes your drink. Majority of the time my order comes out to perfection and other times I wonder if they even read the order, which is kind of dangerous bc what if someone orders a specific milk bc of an allergy and a new barista (or sometimes one that has been there awhile) screws it up? Otherwise it's a decent Starbucks with a majority lovely staff."
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2018-08-20,5,Pre ordered online and everything was ready & correct. My muffin was still warm and my drink was great. Staff was really nice as I picked up my order. The establishment was also super clean. This is my usual neighborhood starbucks and it never disappoints.
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2018-08-14,5,Not sure why this location doesn't have more stars. but I've frequented it and service has been nothing but friendly and drinks have been tasty. There are plenty of seats and tables which is nice since most NYC ones are much smaller.
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2018-07-31,1,The absolute worst Starbucks in all of Manhattan.  They get every online order wrong even when it's written and printed for them.  Not to mention the loooooong time it takes to get a drink.
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2018-06-24,1,Beware of the panhandlers at this store. None of the employees kick them out because of political correctness
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2018-04-22,1,Horrible experience at this location.  After ordering a large ice coffee (simple enough) and waiting over 20 mins to receive order we left.  The workers behind the counter were slow and extremely disorganized.   The work stations were filthy and no one was getting the correct order.   I don't recommend this location.
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2018-02-22,1,"This location has the worst baristas ever!!!. This is my second time here and the last until they change the staff or get some training in customer service. They are rude, ignore customers while they talk amongst themselves, and treat their customers like garbage. 


Seriously the worst customer service"
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2018-02-22,1,"If I could give this location zero stars I would. The customer service is awful (there's only one barista that isn't rude ) they argue , and disrespect the customers, This is my second time here and my last until they change staff. It is unacceptable behavior and customers should not be treated the way these baristas are treating them. Really disgusted with service."
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2017-12-31,2,"From the very start, this establishment had very unfriendly and uncaring staff who does not care for their customers, let people wait at the register while they are continuing private conversations very loudly, and play offensive and very loud music from their own phone. 
The manager seems absolutely not in control of his employees. The place is also not clean. 
Not clean, bad service, loud and unpleasant music... 
if, like me, you are not happy about this place, please call Corporate Starbucks so they do something about it."
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2017-12-29,1,"Beware, that although this is a very nice and new Starbucks but the manager must not care about service.  Every time I have been there (now about 5 times) the service has been soooooooo darn slow that I want to scream.  Today for example...There are three people behind the counter and only one making the coffee drinks.  They are all nice people chatting to each other. The ""barrister"" and I use that term lightly with a name that starts with an M and rhymes with Ike, is just chatting.  Just chatting with customers, giving directions, telling them places to visit (none of this would be bad except...) except all the drinks are backing up on the line!    The other two guys are not concerned.  There is clearly no manager present.  I hope this is not the norm but I am telling you.  It happens every time to me. 

Common guys, pleeeeaaaasssseee get your act together.  Take some on site lessons from the high speed SBucks at Penn Sta. and get us out.  Get some more training.  Something!!  This is  NYC!! 

PS: Store was mostly empty last three times there and wait was still 7- 10 minutes."
189,starbucks-new-york-529,2017-11-20,4,"This brand spankin' new Starbucks location is located at the 21 West End building next to SoulCycle and a welcome, welcome sight to those who live on the far west side of the Columbus Circle/Lincoln Square area.  It's perfect for a stop after working out in the mornings after spin class at Soul, working out at NYSC, or boxing/HIIT at FitRxN.

Since it's a newer store, the decor and feel of the place is much more open than some of the crazy busy Starbucks in the city.  The ceilings are high and there is plenty of open seating around the place.  

At this location, you order on the right and pick up on the left, which is a bit strange for me since most of the Starbucks I go to are the opposite.  There are also two entry ways so I just assumed that ordering would be at the right.  

Baristas were fresh and friendly and the service was quick - no crazy lines here yet.  Condiment center and tables were clean.

This will be my new go-to Starbucks on the weekends after a work out.  I'm also sure this place will get crazy foot traffic once all of the buildings surrounding it are finished being built and occupied."
190,bistro-new-york-international-new-york,2009-03-02,4,"This place is a chain and I usually go to another branch. It is much closer. However, I still come here quite often. 

The set up is pretty standard for a midtown lunch place. They have a hot and cold buffet ($6-7/per pound), deli section ($6-8/per sandwich), soup section ($6 for Udon soup), salad bar ($8 unlimited toppings), sushi ($5+) and drinks, yogurts, and other small snacks. 

The salad is by far the best and most delicious deal as it's made right in front of you and you get to put in as many toppings into it as you like. There is also a selection of 10-15 different dressings (including 5+ low fat/ low carb options). 

I also am a fan of the deli section as all cold cuts are boars head and they have some nice bread options. This particular location also has a good selection of pre-made gourmet sandwiches. The sushi is generally not extremely impressive in variety but always fresh. They usually have at least the Rainbow or the Dragon roll for those seeking a special rolls. 

The hot / cold buffet looks pretty fresh with an extensive selection."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2020-01-03,5,"For bakeries, hard to top this one.  The ham sandwich was a delicious chew with smokiness.  The veggie cheese and sun-dried tomato croissant sandwich was finger licking good.

But the apple tart was the show stealer.  Thinly baked and just cannot stop eating."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2020-01-01,5,"The second time I was there, and still excellent. It was around Christmas and really busy but Kesiya. (I hope I spelled her name right) was very patient and nice. I had my favorite cranberry pecan roll. This time, it was a sandwich I'm with butter and cheddar cheese. It was so good! Excellent service! Really good bread and butter. I saw they had Russ and Daughters lox sandwiches! Next time."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2019-06-03,5,Cafe D'Avignon is located in the food court under the Plaza Hotel. You enter from 58th St.  We were staying in the area and grabbed breakfast here every day. All the baked goods were delicious. We could have just kept eating. The coffee was also good and the service was fast.  The food court is a great place for a quick bite anytime of day.  There are over a dozen quick serve eateries that all seemed to do a good business and cover a wide variety of foods - something for everyone!
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2018-11-10,5,"Love this place !!
Cappuccino was perfect !!
Omg .
Dreaming of another .
They move u thru the line quickly & w a welcoming efficiency,
it does bottle neck at the register & the espresso machine , but the Cap was legit & artisan , made w care & they do make sure u get it , by calling ur name often to hand it to you warm & delicious.
Had a open faced Ham and egg , just out of the oven , wow , really amazing , bread was crunchy .
They have Russ and daughters sandwiches , lots of people love them .
Have not tried the pastries , but I want to !!
Ha ha 
Plaza Food hall is crowded ... and pretty hot .
But , it's the basement , of the FABULOUS PLAZA ,
Got to love it !"
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2018-10-31,2,"Looks better then it is. Service is slowww. They'd rather chat with each other then serve, and sandwiches are below average. Whatever you get usually has one slice of cheese or turkey on it. So for $10 a sandwich your better off going somewhere else for a more quality lunch."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2018-01-01,4,"Very good capuccino here.. Very fresh morning chocolate croissant was very good - buttery, perfectly flaky, but had too little chocolate filling.  
Probably an overall safe bet for the food hall."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2017-11-12,3,"Stale croissants never please anyone.

And needless to say, we weren't pleased. We stopped by for a quick snack while walking through the park, but we should've kept moving. The croissant we got was crusty and old, making it a chore to eat. The redeeming pastry was the spinach quiche, which we both agreed was well made. However, we asked for it warmed, and the inside was still cold. Pass next time."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2017-06-09,4,"YUM!!!!! My favourite is the smoked salmon brioche. $5 and not has massive / heavy as a bagel, when you want just a small taste instead of a meal. It means you have room for some of the awesome pastries. Nice place to stock up for a morning picnic in Central Park."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2017-03-20,3,"Their breads are very good and made daily, good coffee too. But their staff members were not very nice..."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2017-03-15,4,"I love this place. The breads are made daily and are delicious. My favorite is the smoked salmon on brioche but all the breakfast sandwiches are good. The food hall gets crowded and seating can be hard, but the staff is courteous and friendly. Was very surprised to see the one-star review by Melissa S. below, but a quick look at her profile shows that that's the only rating she gives."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2017-03-15,1,"I chose this place to purchase a coffee and a breakfast sandwich. While I was ordering my food, I noticed that the staff members were eating while working. I'm pretty sure this is against health codes. My coffee and my sandwich  were both cold. I took my sandwich back and told her the eggs were cold. She took it from me and reheated it without washing her hands after eating. The staff here are extremely rude and unprofessional. They talk amongst themselves and act like you're not even there."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2017-01-26,4,"My mom & I have shared quite a few sandwiches from Pain D'Avignon.  Although a bit on the pricier side, they have a nice selection and ingredients are quality.  We recently split the tuna Nicoise (crunchy baguette) and the tomato mozzarella pesto (seeded roll) - both were great and filling.  All of their breakfast pastries look delicious too."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2016-10-17,5,Oh. My. Goodness. I am not a fan of quiche but the Lorraine quiche here is AMAZING. Everything about it is tasty.. from the bacon to the shallots to the puff pastry crust. Worth every penny. I could eat here every morning for breakfast.
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2016-06-15,3,"Scored an OK but overly crispy kougin amann far inferior to the DKA, so maybe stick with their breads."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2016-03-28,4,"I dropped by the Plaza Food Hall to grab a quick coffee, and I must say this place makes a mean mocha. Is it worth $5? Well, that's about the price of a cup of Starbucks, and this place certainly makes better coffee than Starbucks. On top of that, they add some nice latte art for you to gaze at.

I haven't tried any of their other menu items, but I'll be back."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2015-09-08,3,"The baker good look delicious however they were not the best I have had. Good location, good service but need to improve on the taste of the quiche and croissant."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2015-08-12,4,"Located in the Plaza food hall, Pain D'Avignon is one of the only cafes within walking distance from my office serving Stumptown coffee. With the exception of one particular experience where my latte tasted slightly burnt, the espresso drinks are always on point - smooth, strong, with the perfect amount of foam. Their pastries are also quite good, the kouign amman, walnut croissant were perfectly flaky and buttery."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2015-06-24,4,"Mornings in New York are my favorite.  The city just sounds different in the morning, and it's not as packed everywhere you try to go (except coffee shops).

En route to my morning appointment, I stopped by Pain D'Avignon in the Plaza Food Hall to grab a croissant (ham and cheese) for a quick bite.  The bread and pastries looked really good and fresh, and it was hard to choose just one.  With a few minutes left to spare, I was able to sit by myself in peace next to the escalator and munch on my breakfast.

If I find myself in this area again, I'd definitely love to try some of their sweeter fare."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2015-06-08,4,"About the last thing I expected to find in the basement-level Plaza Food Hall was a French bakery, but I'm always open to sampling surprises.  I'm very happy I did, as even on a Sunday afternoon they had a very diverse selection of extremely fresh breads available.  I walked away with one large baguette, one large ciabatta, and a small pain francaise.  All were well-baked, and the staff were fast and cheerful.  A great find, and a place I'm looking forward to coming back to, as there is no life without bread."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2014-10-01,3,"The Kouign Amann here was lackluster compared to Dominique Ansel's. It was dense and sticky, not at all fluffy/flaky. And the guys working the kiosk were pretty inattentive. I also got 12oz. of Stumptown drip coffee here. If you want cream for your joe, they leave room and top it off with (too much) whole milk for you. Only sugar, which I don't take with my coffee, is self-served.

Their breads and pastries are so... pretty... though. And that logo with a bread-peddling road bike, so enticing to my inner hipster (argh... so easy), will give Pain D'Avignon many more tries, I'm sure; looking forward to checking out their retail store in LES' Essex Market."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2014-01-03,3,"Stumptown coffee boom ...whats not to like ..

Oh they serve it in a crap cup and you can't find a seat but its still good coffee.

My suggestion is one of you grab a seat the other grab the coffee then a second mission out to grab a cake from one of the many dessert stands here in the plaza."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2013-08-12,3,"LOCATED IN THE PLAZA FOOD HALL

the breads here looked OH so tasty but alas after ordering we weren't too impressed
---Ham gruyere croissant: NOT flaky but i enjoyed the sesame seeds on top

not much available seating since this place gets crowded with all the other bakeries & food vendors in this food hall"
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2013-01-17,4,"If a place makes bomb ass fresh bread, they probably make a bomb ass bread pudding. [Chinese proverb]

I can vouch for this, especially when said bread pudding is lemon apple flavored."
191,cafe-d-avignon-the-plaza-new-york,2012-10-14,4,"Excellent breads. Everything looks really good, but all I tried this time was the Chocolate Pistachio Escargot. This is a very generously sized piece of rich, buttery, and extremely chocolatey bread.

They have several other awesome looking choices, like Chocolate Brioche, Croissants, and even the plain loaves of bread.

There are so many other good choices in the Food Hall, like Three Tarts, YoArt, Billy's and Lady M, but you shouldn't overlook this one."

192,kofi-coffee-and-bakery-new-york,2020-02-23,4,"New coffee shop on the corner of 61st and 2nd- if you're an illy coffee fan they've got plenty of beverage options for you! I opted for a cup of coffee, a nutella croissant, and a chocolate madeline. You can get your croissants warmed up, which makes the croissant extra ooey gooey and  delicious. Coffee was on point and the pastries were amazing and definitely fresh, will definitely be back especially since it's right next to the Equinox on 61st street. 

There is a super market that is attached to the coffee shop in case you need to load up on some grocery basics (potatoes/onions/milk/canned goods). They sell plenty of Indian spices/ grains as well."
193,starbucks-new-york-568,2017-10-15,2,"One of the baristas was incredibly rude. Asked for a cup of water and he said to give him one minute. I stood there for 10 minutes waiting for a cup of water! How hard is it to put water in a cup?? He obviously had some down time as he was taking his sweet time making the other drinks. 

Secondly, a kid comes back with a heavy accent, trying to communicate that his drink is watery. The barista doesn't even look at the kid and says ""I don't understand what you're saying"". 

PLEASE WORK ON YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. YOUR BARISTA IS INCREDIBLY UNFRIENDLY AND INEFFICIENT. 

NOTE: the only reason why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the cashier was incredibly nice and friendly."

There were two workers and they were hustling to try and keep up with the line.  They could have used a third worker.  

My complaint is I had grinds at the bottom
Of my cup.   Totally unacceptable for Starbucks. I have to only give it two stars because grinds just shouldn't be in there.  

The guys working were friendly and working hard."
193,starbucks-new-york-568,2017-07-31,2,"This is the weirdest Starbucks. First of all, it's like a maze to get to it - located in an odd spot within the Uniqlo store. Annoying, if all you want is a cup of coffee. 

Seating = One star. I really dislike those tiny round tables with edge of your butt seats around the columns. No space to spread out & relax.  Worst of all = a separate charging station where you leave your device - did not see any outlets near the seating area. Even if there were outlets, it'd be tough to use your laptop & enjoy a cup of coffee at the same time.  On the plus side, very upscale crowd & clean. 

It's such a rigamarole getting in & out of this place. Feels like too much work. Pass."
193,starbucks-new-york-568,2016-06-19,1,"Forgot to make my order, got an ice-cold poker fave when I ask for my drink. Very NYC-style, not gonna come back again."

Overall, I liked the concept, everything is new and the staff was very friendly."

Had a coconut donut and some munkins that were fresh and hit the spot.  Also, the cashiers were very nice and attentive.  Hope they can maintain that consistently."

I used to buy my coffee other locations where it's located at 7th Ave and I guess I will keep my loyal on that place. The only reason I like this Dunkin' which it was located on 1721 Broadway, has a order ahead which is really nice you don't have to wait too long.  Only thing that I could tell about this place they should hired more nicer people instead of sullen people who is serving the coffee I don't mean the people who is working  at register. 

Hope it gets better happy to have that Dunkin'"
195,paris-baguette-new-york-31,2020-07-21,4,"Before covid19, we'd take a very long walk and stop for coffee and a pastry in our travels.
These days, we take a long walk and come home. 
Today we stopped along our walk, not too far from home, for the first time! Iced americano for me, decaf for hubby, shared a pain aux raisins - perfect!  Sat outside, which worked well for most of the time (until someone was smoking on the corner and we left).
Tables nicely spaced, coffee good, pastry yummy, service inside masked and clean and accurate.
Great place to stop!"
195,paris-baguette-new-york-31,2020-07-02,3,I live just 1 block away and go to this place every day to buy food and drinks which I like! But stuff are awful !!! Every day they missed something or mixed up. And they are so slowly! You have to tell them 10 times what do you want and remind and after it's very important to check what they put into the bag ! It's so annoying and takes a lot of times !
195,paris-baguette-new-york-31,2020-06-18,3,This place needs to improve the untrained staffs. It was 3 staffs with only 4 people in the store. All chaotic with the orders. Would be nice to have your staff who can really pay attention. Otherwise simply take people's name and write it on the coffee cups and sandwich orders. So we all don't get wrong lunches. Paying a lot for my orders and getting such basic sandwich ‍
195,paris-baguette-new-york-31,2020-04-19,5,"Working across the street in the hospital it is an honor to have Paris Baguette's support during this pandemic. They have welcomed the community along with the healthcare community with open arms. They have been offering Health care staff free small coffes every day and I could not be more grateful to know that they have our back during this crises. I love and appreciate it....and cant wait to try all the pastries. 

The place is very clean and spacious, the pastries look delicious and I highly recommend checking this new addition to the community. THANK YOU PARIS BAGUETTE!! Welcome to the midtwon west family!!"

My last interaction here, there was five workers behind the bar. They were all talking with each other as if they werent at work. I stood behind the counter for 3 mins before even getting recognized. when I got to Starbucks there was no one in line in front of me and I noticed two people that were together waiting at the end for their drinks. from the time I ordered until the time I got my chai tea latte and egg bites ( i requested double baked) it took 12 minutes. And I received my eggbites cooked once only."
197,starbucks-new-york-590,2020-01-22,1,There is no bathroom at this location. Should really be a sin not to have a restroom In a coffee shop. Makes literally no sense.
197,starbucks-new-york-590,2019-12-12,1,"This place needs new management. They play loud hip hop at 6am. They must be playing the music while they set the shop up before the store opens, but they never turn it off once the store is open. The staff is really ghetto and aggressive. I feel like I'm in a bodega in the hood instead of a Starbucks in Murray hill. Such a sad shame too. I hope Starbucks isn't the cause of the neighborhood dropping in class or value."
197,starbucks-new-york-590,2019-11-25,1,"Starbucks on 1st Avenue right opposite NYU Tisch seemed to just do everything wrong compared to usual Starbucks standards - from both poor and slow service to lacking a decent amount of seating (especially considering this could be a good place to grab a drink and a snack after spending a long amount of time at hospital as I had), to even playing loud music again (Come on NYC, why do you do this at most Starbucks locations? I'm all for playing music quietly in the background but not this loud monstrosity!)

Even the selection of merchandise and snacks / bottled beverages in the fridge seemed to lack again compared to other stores (which I must add there are a lot of nearby, with many just around the block on 2nd and 3rd). One of the worst stores in the area sadly, and one I would neither return to nor recommend which is a real shame too considering Starbucks is my regular coffee haunt and one of my favourite brands in general.

197,starbucks-new-york-590,2019-11-21,3,I agree with Sandy's review the music at 6 AM is too much and too loud- Ariana Grande and hip hop. Not how I want to start my morning. The barista was friendly but did not hear my order. I asked for a tall  coffee in a grande cup.
197,starbucks-new-york-590,2019-10-23,1,"Not enough staff to accommodate the orders. The music is very inappropriate for a coffee shop; there's really no need for loud rap music at 6AM. when mobile orders are placed 15 mins in advance, orders are still not ready; the sticker is not even on the cup. I'd rather walk the extra block to the Starbucks on 2nd ave; the staff there are friendlier and faster in general."
198,kafi-new-york,2020-02-25,1,"I would think this would be a nice coffee spot since it's in Saks and wanted to give it a shot. I went to buy a hot matcha latte and it was the worst I've ever had in my life. There was no matcha flavor, probably just hot milk that tasted horrible. Not worth the price as well. Heard the service is not great also. The barista needs better training. Rather go to Starbucks instead."
198,kafi-new-york,2020-01-12,5,"Kafi is located on the fifth floor of Saks fifth avenue. You can see it at the other of the end of the store just getting out of the elevators. They offer standard expresso drinks plus some seasonal specials along with light sandwiches and cookies. 

My kids really enjoyed their hot chocolate. It had a richer and deeper chocolate flavor when compared to the ones we normally order at Starbucks. The egg salad sandwich was well-made and fresh. It was a welcome snack before our 10-15 block walk to dinner afterwards. 

The service was professional and  friendly. There were some people in training so drinks took slightly longer. The manager working that day was gently coaching the new employees in a positive manner. 

With only enough tables for approximately 8-10 small parties, it can be tough to find a seat. 
 
It you want to bring back coffee beans, they have bags of them for sale near the napkin/creamer/sugar area on the left."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2020-05-13,1,I stopped in yesterday morning for an ice coffee and was told to come back in 15 minutes. Today at 8:10am I placed a mobile order and when I arrived the store is closed.
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2020-03-09,1,"Bad coffee. I always have to go back to get my drink corrected. I order a caramel iced latte, and some how it always slips their mind to add caramel. And today I return my drink to add caramel as they did not add before giving me my drink (I know this because they didn't even bother to mix the milk and espresso and I did not see any caramel) and of course it tasted like a plain latte, and they passed back the drink with no correction done. Which if I wanted a plain latte I'll pay the cheaper price rather than paying extra for caramel. And there are other times I'm passed back a overly sweet latte as in to spite me for asking for a correction of my drink. Definitely there's a Lack of consistency in their coffee."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2020-01-12,1,"I have never experienced such incompetence, attitude and poor customer service. They did not have all the flavors on the menu, and we're rude about it. The lazy worker didn't want to scoop our chocolate chip ice cream because ""it's hard"" and tried to change our flavor. They also fought with me about accepting cash at the register. Overall horrible experience."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2019-12-16,5,Always really good. The guys there after 5pm really make my night. So polite & friendly! It's refreshing.
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2019-11-13,1,"Very rarely write reviews unless I truly feel the need to voice my opinion on an establishment. Today, an instance occurred where I strongly feel that need. I wish I was exaggerating when I say that I go to DD every single morning. I've been to many different locations in various states over the years, and this one is by far the worst I've ever visited in terms of customer service. Today was my third time there, other two experiences were equally disappointing. Unfortunately, and unbeknownst to the employees there, I understand and speak their native tongue. So you can imagine my anger and annoyance when I hear them speaking to eachother and accusing me of lying about what I first ordered and changing my mind the second time. They laugh, make fun of customers and still manage to mess up everyone's orders. I had no issues correcting them and making it known that I understood they were bad-mouthing me. After she realized I was one of them, the woman at the front suddenly became much nicer and quiet. Absolutely ridiculous!! The disrespect. What sucks even more is that they still made my drink wrong after she confirmed it with me 3 times. I rather deprive myself of caffeine than go back there ever again. Save yourself and walk over a couple blocks to the one on 1st ave, trust me."

i usually get the beyond sausage without eggs or cheese and an order of hash browns with it. when i ordered it today, i said the hash browns after i said beyond sausage. i then said without the egg or cheese. i get that the cashier had to change my order from that but i didn't need to see her eye roll. food is good but attitude is not friendly."

The Iced Tea Lemonade isn't necessarily bad, but it just doesn't taste like what I expected it to taste like. I thought it would be somewhat similar to a lemon black tea, but it just tasted like someone dumped a cup full of ice into a glass of Minute Maid lemonade. There was no hint of tea whatsoever and left my throat feeling really parched. Ended up drinking only half and throwing the rest away. Really disappointed."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2019-04-05,1,"I usually don't leave reviews but this Dunkin' Donuts is the worst location I've ever been to.

One time I went 3 times in a row, one day it was 25 cents for almond milk, then it was 50 then down to 25 and I just went back in and now it's 75 cents. Stop ripping people off when you can get a carton of almond milk for a dollar. No other location changes their prices DAILY. Cashiers are also rude. Told the lady why are there price differences and she just said that was the price and started laughing. Horrible service."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2019-03-15,1,"Gave me the wrong drink and my donut was squashed, jelly oozing out, wasn't even appetizing, didn't even taste good. But best believe I still ate it."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2018-05-11,2,"I don't think the cashiers are as rude as everyone says as I haven't had any issues with them. My main issues lie in that they don't make orders on a first come, first serve basis."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2018-05-01,1,"Today as I was drinking my coffee, I found a HAIR. I went back to get a replacement and they literally rinsed the cup that I had just given them (with the hair) and they just added coffee to it. I saw with my own eyes that they just rinsed my cup and when I asked them, they claimed that they gave me a new cup. I do understand that it is a busy franchise especially since it's near a school, but I'm utmost disgusted by the service that I received today. Disgusted by the service, disgusted by the coffee. This is not my first time I had a problem with Dunkin' Donuts. Not fair especially since coffee the coffee is overpriced."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2018-04-10,1,"Cashier was rude AF. Had to leave this review because I was steaming with the way me and my friend were treated. It was the past Friday, April 6th, around 7:40PM. There was only one person working and no line, so we decided to get ice cream. He got the cup and scoop and asked what flavor I wanted. I told him rainbow, and he proceeded to talk to the delivery guy for a whole minute while I waited for him to do a simple scoop, but he just kept talking to the guy. )We had to catch a show before 8PM.) During that time, two more customers came in and lined up behind us when we went to check out, we were at the counter for 30 seconds and he had the nerve to say ""HURRY UP"". When he wasted our time talking to other people on the shift and kept us waiting earlier. I used to go to this Dunkin a few times per school year. Now I don't want to go back unless it's my only choice... I worked in food retail and customer service for five years, and even without that experience, anyone should know it's no okay to tell a customer to ""HURRY UP"". If the customer was taking a long time, they would know and they would feel awkward. We were only there for a couple seconds and he said that to us. Seemed like he didn't want to work. Shouldn't be there if he can't handle a few minutes of work."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2017-09-25,1,Horrible horrible horrible. They do not accept the survey code for free donuts. Additionally they charge you more for something you never ordered.
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2017-02-10,1,"They're quick to get your order but they completely got my order wrong! I paid more because I ordered a sausage, egg, and cheese on a croissant and got a bagel with cream cheese which is cold and very hard. I couldn't even go back because it wasn't till I got back in school to eat and took my sandwich out. The previous time I went there, I got a coffee and it didn't even taste like hazelnut and I could taste sugary chunks."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2017-01-24,3,"I sometimes stop by here in between classes to grab a bagel with cream cheese and hash browns. 

The food tastes like how it does at every other Dunkin' Donuts - there isn't much to write about.

In regards to the store itself, the lines here are usually pretty long and it can take quite some time to order, wait for them to make your food, and actually get your order. I usually get my food within 10 minutes of ordering, but there have been times where I have waited longer. I suggest you don't come here if you're in a rush."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2016-10-22,3,"I usually stop in here for a quick breakfast in between classes and my only complaint would be the ridiculous long line. Then again, it is located in an extremely crowded area. You have to check your bags every time you receive your orders because sometimes it may be the wrong one."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2015-10-01,1,"If I could leave 0 stars I would. This has to be the worst Dunkin Donuts experience. Ordered a sandwich on croissant which they waited until I paid to tell me they did not have. Then I waited 23 mins, literally, for a sandwich & an order of hashbrowns. Ugh. Never coming here again."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2015-09-17,1,"This is the worst dunkin donuts, i have walked out of this place three times after paying because then the manager decides to inform me that he does not have either the ice cream ( vanilla) or the cappuccino mix for the cappuccino blast.  They always inform me after they take my money. The staff never knows how to make it right always try to put vanilla yogurt instead of vanilla. no one is trained right.  This is a brand new location and its in a busy place we understand that but at the same time if you do not take care of customers you will have none left. CHANGE MANAGEMENT!!!! FInd a person who knows how to run this place, and order the right supplies needed."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2015-06-29,1,"The only positive thing about this store is their free WiFi. Other than that, it's embarrassing. My friend and I came in craving our favorite flavors, Oreo and mint chocolate chip, and the store didn't have either, including several other flavors like Reece's and cookie dough. They make sure to stock random ""signature"" flavors, but don't bother to have the staples of ice cream.
That wouldn't be too much of a problem, if they didn't advertise that they have those flavors, and more. It's so frustrating to say ""can I get that sundae on your poster"" and for them to respond with ""sorry, we don't have any of those ice cream flavors"".
Additionally, their menu advertised different kinds of cones and drink sizes that didn't exist. The workers were all scatterbrained and very disconnected from each other. I honestly could have paid for a kid's single scoop and told the other employee I ordered a sundae with this and that topping.
If you want to cheat a store out of some ice cream, this is the place to do it. I'm surprised it's still in business.
With several great places to eat surrounding it, including an authentic New York ice cream shop three blocks down, all you do at this Baskin Robbins is pay for disappointment."
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2015-06-04,1,I hope someone from the store or company reads this because I've been there several times over several months and the coffee is always very weak/watery/bland.
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2015-05-21,4,"I've started trying this Dunkin on the way to the Subway and haven't been disappointed yet.

The staff is quick during morning rush hour and remembers my order which is super convenient! 

This Dunkin is a combo with Baskin Robbins as well.

It's clean, there's a small amount of seating along the wall in the front, and the the staff understands the need for speed during the morning craziness.

Will make this my new stop over the one in Rock Center!"
199,dunkin-new-york-12,2015-04-01,2,"This is a Baskin Robbins, too, but I doubt Yelp will reflect that requested change any time soon. Ordered a $3.31 sundae (from 3 separate people) and they tried just handing me two scoops, so I asked for the appropriate toppings and it turned out they had no hot fudge and apparently the last person to order it was in 2011, as the staffer was as disgusted as we were by the sight of the container. Snickers was gross but First Class Camouflage was actually quite tasty, by BR standards at least."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2020-03-07,4,"Across the street from the Broadway theater, a good place to stuff the face before West Side Story and quick.   As with all stores, it's quick and easy service with a reliable product.  They bathrooms are a bit choatic: they have codes, it's hard to tell which ones are open, lot of people trying to use them, very gas-station feeling: more of a NYC problem I would guess."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2019-10-14,4,"Staff is friendly and the food is standard overpriced NYC sandwiches and such. Always tastes good, though. Do wish they would hire more cashier's, especially for the morning hours. Sometimes there's a huge line and one person is trying to make drinks and ring everything in."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2019-09-24,4,"Just like all locations, convent  and quick.   Good place to grab and go or sit for a while - if you can find available seat.  Nothing special - but reliable."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2019-06-06,1,This is the second time I have received a bunch of nickels as change for my purchases. The fact that their are two banks on either side of this location make no sense at all. I spoke to the manager and he got nasty with me. Poor customer service.
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2019-06-03,4,Exactly what you'd expect from a Prêt. Products tasted fine. Wasn't particularly well stocked though I went an obscure time. Guy they had serving was laid back but helpful.
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2019-04-03,5,Love this place! great coffee and great food. Lots of variety of breakfast and lunch foods. Wish I had one of these closer to my home town!
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2019-03-17,1,Really slow service. But also really baddd service. Ran out of everything and they don't tell you until after you've paid. I ordered an iced almond milk latte with vanilla and they asked me SIX times what the order was...6 times. And still couldn't make it. Only had soy milk. Only had caramel syrup. This was 1pm. How are you out of stock at 1pm? Lol. Didn't tell me until after i had paid. I ended up just walking out. I would've taken the drink with me but after 15 min it still wasn't ready. Figured it wasn't worth the trouble and said never mind.
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2019-01-10,4,"Giving this spot a 4 because I always receive top quality service from the staff that works there. There usually friendly and don't mind doing little extra things. 
I went there a few times for breakfast and wanted a cinnamon roll, my typical, except all the rolls looked sad; over cooked with very little icing, which we all know is the best part. So I asked if they could put some more icing and they politely obliged. In fact we had a pretty good laugh, and were in complete agreement that the cinnamon rolls did look underwhelming and sad. Now a days it's rare that customer service is good so when it is, it should be mentioned. 
Otherwise, I normally only purchase a Tomato and Feta soup, coffee, or cinnamon roll. 
The tomato and feta soup is good, although occasionally too salty. Or not enough provided in the cup. I purchase to go so I don't think of returning to the location to tell them soup is missing. Cinnamon rolls usually very good and filling. Coffee mostly great, however a few time there were ground in my coffee. I guess they can't be perfect at everything, They have Almond milk at the coffee bar station! 
It's a great quick lunch if you're not trying to pay an arm AND leg especially in this area. Or if you don't require too much. 
There are 2 other Prets in the area that I know of and they have the absolute worst service it's disgusting. So now I only go to this one... 
The eating area is large, food is normally always stocked, easy to grab and go. Lines don't take long... so I'm happy! 

Stay true to your great service +++"
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2019-01-06,1,The lady who was on the cash register today Sunday 12/6/2019 at 11:45am has such a nasty attitude. I can't fathom how Pret A Manger hired her. Such a terrible nasty attitude. I will never come back here again. The next customer she helped just asked for a green tea drink but was also given such a nasty attitude that she ended up walking out the store. Terrible.
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2018-12-30,2,"Location itself is great! But the last 3 consecutive times I've been here, they've been out of milk! Today, it's ALL milk, including soy. This is a major disappointment as I was looking forward to my last night in the City and enjoyed the coffee here. Now we have to walk through the crowds in the cold to find another location and pray they have milk. 

The employees were friendly, though, and let us sit inside to keep warm for a bit."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2018-10-21,5,"Stopped in here on a whim while walking around NYC theater district (right across from Late Show with Stephen Colbert studio) and was so pleasantly surprised!

All organic food, coffee, tea, juices, etc!  Loved the vibe - Open, clean, tall-ceilings, wood, rustic.  Super appealing!!

Ordered some really Delicious fennel mint tea and an AMAZING (crispy, flakey outside and soft, doughy inside) almond croissant! 

Cool wood stool and table seating with seating variations throughout.  Very nice vibe!  Quick and kind service and nice clientele!

We will definitely be back!!  Yay NYC ;)"
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2018-07-27,1,"This location is dirty, and the workers were very loud and obnoxious. Joking and playing with one another and taking over the entire restaurant with their joking. Will not come back here."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2018-06-14,3,"Pret is a decent place to grab lunch. Soups are good, sandwiches are okay, salads are decent. Nice ambiance."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2018-05-17,5,"I come in here at least 3 times a week. Place is clean, staff is friendly, and there is always some new tasty thing to try. They have a great breakfast selection; I usually get the savory pastry with mozzarella, tomato, and ham but their frittatas are delicious too.

My two favorite things there: the raspberry lemonade and brownies! omg delicious!"
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2018-05-05,3,"Nice decor, but why can't staff clean up all the good on the chairs, tables and floors. Chor cleanliness thumbs down"
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2018-04-19,5,"What's great place.  The staff and manager are so friendly. I know there are many Pret A Manger in NYC, but definitely visit this one. Great food, great service and incredible people."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2018-03-26,5,"The teamwork and passion i experience from the staff here are amazing.  It is so rare that a franchise/chain store like place exhibits anything near to what I experience when I come here.
This is my second time here, and I was hesitating to come again since there are so many other places in the area, but when I thought about how great the service was last time, I knew I had to come back.  And i am glad I did.

Whatever the manager is doing here, keep it up!  Shianna and Chelsea are super customer support people and I cant imagine it getting any better.

If you are going to the David Letterman theater, Rocktopia, or anything here in the area, definitely stop in!"
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2018-01-21,5,"Travis was a life saver! I lost my wallet at this location. He was kind, patient and helpful when I showed up after closing in a panic as he was cleaning up and trying to close (and go home).
He asked me a couple times to make sure nothing was taken (it wasn't! YEAH for NYC!) and wished me a good trip back home.
Travis needs a raise/promotion/bonus/lunch on the house!"
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-12-12,1,"First of all, this location is not closed YET, but they should. The meat portions in the sandwiches are laughably tiny. Soup was bland, cookie stale.

Cashiers don't seem to be in a hurry and when I had a problem with my credit card chip, the manager basically told me to buzz off. Nice service training folks."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-11-07,5,"This Pret a Manger on Broadway at W53rd is Not closed. It is open. Yelp has wrong information.

I like it for coffee and a quick lunch."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-09-29,2,Service is not great.  They don't have lines set up at the cash registers so it's a total free for all.  Had two people cut me this morning and when I get to the front the cashier shut her station and walked away without saying a word.  I won't be heading back anytime soon.
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-08-07,5,"Great place to chill and grab breakfast, especially for people with dietary restrictions. I'm on Pescetarian and had a multigrain chicken wrap with cilantro, cucumbers, and sesame dressing, and a mango and chia seed ""yoghurt"" that's almond milk-based. Absolutely no dairy or peanuts and everything still hits the spot! The staff also happily confirmed for me the ingredients of my food. My mom had a chocolate croissant that came with coffee of her choice size, and on a rainy day, it was just right. No regrets!"
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-07-21,3,"I came in at 10:30am for a breakfast sandwich. The store is exactly as you'd expect in any other Pret. It's actually quite clean and tidy at this location. I like it. This is a sit-in store and there was a lineup of about 6 people. 

I picked up a sausage and egg sandwhich, one of the pre made ones. The good thing about this chain is that the sandwiches are kept warm in the shelves. The sandwhich it self was a 7/10,  but the price is fair at about $4.60 per sandwhich. I'd come back, but normally just out of convenience, not because of food quality."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-06-27,1,"Literally love Pam & all of their locations but this one happens to be the worst one. Sadly it's the closest one to my school so convenient to get food. So I'm waiting in line to get my iced latte & I guess the manager or whoever was helping make the drinks, & then yelled out something to the customers, which I did not hear because I was on the phone. so then the lady calls me to get my order, I tell her I want an iced latte so she yells out to him a large iced latte, he then comes over with the most attitude & says ""didn't I just ask them who needed drinks made"" & literally just gave me the dirtiest look, me appalled I just stayed there stunned, who talks to customers like that, even tho that happened I still paid & got my drink, not to mention he made it in 2 seconds it being a iced coffee & not a latte . at that point I just wanted to get out of there so I just left with my drink & while I'm leaving the manager basically just stared me down. As if it was my fault I hadn't heard him? Even if I didn't hear him how can you treat a customer like that? I spend tons of money here & that's how you treat people, especially a manager ?!?! I complained to the gm who prolly won't do anything but yea guys just watch out for a nasty small Asian assistant manager who is rude as hell. The staff is also pretty unprofessional themselves so not the first time. Definitely not going back to this location ever again."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-05-30,5,"Oh how I wish Pret a manger was in my city.  What's not to love about this place.  The food is fresh, they have delicious healthy options and whatever they don't sell by the end of the day they donate to those in need.  The service is hit and miss depending on the location but the food is always good and fresh.  My favourite so far was the mac and cheese with butternut squash, so good!!"
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-05-04,5,"I love Pret anyway, for its heathy, super-fresh food. I just want to give props to this particular branch. Went in for a quick lunch and the staff was so extra engaged and fun and nice. Just wanted to say. Good people to go with the good food!"
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-04-09,4,Giving it a 4 star rating because it's the closest to healthy fast food. Everything is fresh and healthy on the go delicious!! Love all the options from wraps to salads pressed juices to lattes and pastries. The reason I'm giving it a 4 is that they did not have soap in the bathroom. Not sure if staff use that bathroom but I think bathrooms with a place as busy as it is should be checked every couple hours. It was concerning that there wasn't even a dispenser to refill. Other than that great place to grab a quick healthy bite of already prepared food.
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-03-27,4,"I have been back a few times and have to up my rating to four stars.   I stop in regularly and get cookies and today the ladies working the counter were so delightful that in addition to my delicious cookies, I received a smile for the day.   That's worth four stars.  It's nice to see people who genuinely enjoy what they are doing.  Such engagement is rare and noteworthy."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-03-06,1,"I have the same salad everyday and I usually put olive oil because I prefer a very light dressing.
Well...the manager in this location today wanted to charge me for the olive oil. I told him that it never happens in any other locations in Manhattan but
honestly his interaction wasn't very nice at all and that's why I'm taking some time to write this review.
I always support PaM but I think a manager should act like a gentleman, understand customers, apologies and ...smile."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-03-04,5,"Within two blocks from my apartment you can find a Paris Baguette, a La Pain Quotidien, and a Pret a Manger. If I lived anywhere else in the world, it would be imprudent for me to post this for fear of revealing my location through some triangulation. Good thing for me, I live in Manahattan which really means I could be pretty much anywhere on the friggin' island. But Pret a Manger may just become my favorite breakfast spot, the biggest thing about this location is it's extremely spacious, which is nice.

I got a breakfast wrap which for the pret is in a crispy whole wheat tortilla and has some eggs and a some veggies in it. Perfect for a light early-morning meal. Highly recommend."
200,pret-a-manger-new-york-78,2017-02-13,1,I got a large chicken noodle soup. It had 1 noodle and 1 piece of chicken in it and nothing else. They are very literal about Chicken(singular) Noodle(singular) Soup.
201,starbucks-new-york-539,2020-02-20,1,"Tons of ppl and tourists. Plus some workers have attitudes. Get over urself. U work at Starbucks. The bar is not very high to work there. Stop power tripping. Messed up my order plenty of times. Take forvwer to do basic tasks. I know it's a tough location to work at, but u chose to work these. So care a little bit about doing your job well. Mr sbux would appreciate it. I for sure don't appreciate coming here. Made thst mistake one too many times."
201,starbucks-new-york-539,2019-11-27,1,I realize they're busy on a holiday week but the poor service and the orgotten order and then the refusal to make up when the order is forgotten makes the customer service that much worse. And the owner of this company is wanting to be president of the United State? Get your  house in order sir before tinking mistakenly you could try to order anything else! Rude employees!
201,starbucks-new-york-539,2019-04-21,1,"They ran out of cream and by their own decided to switch to another base of sugar which didn't taste the same. They didn't offer me any solution!

How can the closest Starbucks from Times Square run out the cream? Awful!"
201,starbucks-new-york-539,2019-03-30,4,"Your average Starbucks. Located right behind Times Square. Clean location with plenty of table seating to rest your feet. Baristas are friendly.

The hubs ordered a regular half-cafe Americano, and found it too watered down. Baristas were happy to make a new one for him.

Bathroom is clean as well."
201,starbucks-new-york-539,2019-03-26,2,My friend ans I visited this Starbucks today and saw a little fly walking on the chocolate cake. Then decided not to get one of those.
201,starbucks-new-york-539,2018-12-14,1,The WORST service ever. Waited about 10 min with 4 people behind the counter totally ignoring us. Walked out without getting coffee or snacks and went to different coffee shop.
201,starbucks-new-york-539,2018-07-15,5,"This was one of the many Starbucks locations we stopped by to take a breather. This one was located near Times Square, and fortunately the line was not too long. We were also able to find seating here, even though most tables were taken.
I ordered a blonde iced cappuccino, which was smooth but with a punch of caffeine. I also got a cup of water to stay hydrated in this summer heat.
The place was nicely decorated. They had an interesting painting on the wall toward the front of the store. The rest of the store was pretty clean, and the staff ran this place efficiently.
We sat down to relax for a bit, and took in the ambient of this busy section of town. After some time, we went along our way. 
Thankfully, this SB location provided a nice and convenient place to rest on our busy day of sightseeing."
202,carb-cart-new-york,2008-06-13,4,"Great Coffee here at the Carb Cart!!
If you can manage to purchase just a coffeee-you are in good shape, because the donuts scream your name, but then reason strikes and you imagine yourself three times the size you already are and just take your steaming hot coffee and say thank you.
He takes pride in his coffee and will tell you his secret, if you ask nicely and there is not a long line."
203,table-866-new-york,2018-09-16,2,Horrible online ordering service. I never received a confirmation email and they said they never received my order. Ending up throwing away $51. Smh money dosent grow in trees. Gave it 2 stars cause honestly the burrata pizza is not bad. But being from brooklyn i can get better pizza elsewhere.
203,table-866-new-york,2018-09-01,5,"This is by far the best in-hotel coffee shop I have ever been to and there are several reasons for that.  

First, they actually have everything listed on their menu in stock and the baristas know how to make the full Starbucks menu. Second, it's only accessible to hotel guests which is very smart of Marriott and makes you feel like you are appreciated by the brand. Finally, the three women who work here each morning actually seem to enjoy it. They create a warm and friendly dynamic in the restaurant. They serve up breakfast and lattes quickly and consistently delicious. Each day I ordered coffee or a latte and something for breakfast. The first day I had the breakfast croissant. It had egg, cheese, and two sausage patties on a fresh croissant.  It was delicious and freshly made, but honestly big enough for two to share. The other days I had a fresh muffin and each one was delicious. After two days, they remembered me and my order. What a great way to start the day!

I will stay at this hotel in the future simply for the benefit of not having to hunt down breakfast and coffee every morning! If you are reading this review, cancel your hotel now and rebook at the Courtyard on 3rd Avenue in Midtown. You will be glad you did!"
204,dunkin-manhattan-2,2019-10-31,5,When by on the way home tonight from dinner and the staff were so nice! Doughnuts were excellent!
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2019-06-14,1,Extremely poor service. No one is willing to help and most associates usually have an attitude when requesting changes. Every time I visit this location I am extremely disappointed.
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2018-07-11,2,This place is a very busy spot because it's in a train station. The 2 stars are for the staff.... they aren't friendly at all and have little patience. I'm not returning to this location but if you want to get a coffee before work ... good luck.
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2017-09-26,3,this double d is on 5th ave between 52nd and 53rd st and i am on my way to work and i remember i have a free 6 donut deal from the peel off the coffee cup promo and i am fairly sure that the folks at work will appreciate free food. it's a typical dd will some seating inside not much space but the folks who work in the area can get their caffeine fix before hitting the many office buildings in the area. i would suggest they hire an extra person cause the lines move a bit slow during morning rush but otherwise your average bland vanilla dunkin donuts which is fine by me.
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2017-08-16,1,Worst DD's to get an order wrong. I went for a quick run. I ordered a medium green iced tea and got regular. Do not stop by here  Service is apalling and the staff is clueless.
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2017-08-11,1,Been coming here for about 3 years and found a roach floating on top of my blueberry ice tea on 08/10/2017. I returned for a full refund. Do not eat or drink from this place! Beyond disgusted!
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2017-05-12,1,"Have to update to drop this down to one star.  For the third time in as many weeks, they are unable to use your DD app.  I know it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of humanity, but that means you don't get any points for buying your coffee.  And today, as I had a free coffee on my app, I could not get my free coffee.  Instead I had to pay for it and this DD is 20 cents more expensive than another DD I walk by in the morning, so I not only lost my free coffee but it cost me an extra 20 cents.    I think they are just trying to scam regular DD users out of using the app.  

They are a lot faster than the other DD I visit, but at least they are honest there and the DD app reader has never been down in the 500+ times I have been in the other DD place (yes, I am the Duke of that other place so I know how many times I've been there).

One star for the scammers here who hate loyal customers."
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2016-12-28,1,"Worst Dunkin' Donuts I've ever been to. 
Not only are they unorganized they are extremely rude. I was in line and due to the small labeling of the donuts I couldn't read what type of donut holes they had. I asked what type they had and she said 'Are you all together?' Pointing to the two other people that were with me. I said 'Yes, but I'm the only one ordering.' She then proceeds to wave me to the side so she could help the people behind me. 
Her name is Beauty and she shouldn't not be working in customer service. 
Her attitude sure isn't beautiful."
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2016-12-06,1,This place ruin my morning. I order two sugar donuts and when I'm at work ready to eat them i got two jelly donuts how can someone mess that up.
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2015-12-28,1,"Possibly the slowest NYC Dunkin Donuts I have ever been to. The city is way too busy for slow service. Once in a while I stop by this Dunkin because it is in the train station for the E/M train, very convenient location. But the convenience is defeated by slow service. The cashiers are rude, with barely a greeting."
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2015-01-05,2,"3 stars for coffee, 2 stars for the cronut. 

Came for a quick coffee run - It's your average coffee (way better than starbucks though, hands down). 
Tried a cronut - not impressed. Don't get it."
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2014-06-15,5,"Got a crazy donut craving in this middle of the night this past weekend. I ordered one donut, and the manager was super nice and gave me a bunch for free. Admittedly, it was after midnight, and they had a lot of donuts left that obviously weren't going to sell. But it was still nice of him! The donuts tasted pretty fresh actually."
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2013-12-12,1,"I had the absolute worst customer service experience yesterday at this dunkin donuts. I use to stop here every morning as it is conveniently located on my way out of the subway. 
I ordered my regular large hot tea, black extra sugar. The girl made me a black coffee. First time in a couple months I had the wrong thing made. I said, sorry but I wanted a tea not a coffee. She told me in these exact words ""then you should have ordered a tea"" I told her that I did order a tea and she must not have heard me over all of the noise. The manager came running over and starting screaming at me that I have to order clearly. I told her that it isn't a big deal, just make me a tea and I will be on my way. She insisted on telling how I need to order and that it isn't their fault that they made a coffee. I had to remind her that I was the customer and tell her to calm down and stop yelling at me. 
This went back and forth for some time until I got so frustrated that I left without anything that I had already paid for. 
I will never return to this dunkin donuts. There is a much better one that I stopped at this morning on 55th st between 5th and 6th. A little out of my way, but at least I won't be screamed at...
Please do not go here."
205,dunkin-new-york-13,2012-09-08,3,"This is an average dunkin donuts. I just like that it's in a convenient location right in the E/M subway station so you can grab a coffee or breakfast on your way out of the station. The store is tiny, so when it's rush hour, there is usually a line out the door. The coffee is nothing special. The bagels and donuts are your average. Good for a quick coffee run."
206,msnbc-com-digital-cafe-manhattan,2013-02-26,1,"UGH - total rip off  I work a few blocks down and was craving froyo but it is too cold to do the walk to Pinkberry in Columbus Circle.  So, I thought that I would give Red Mango a try.  A TINY size small yogurt is was $5 and toppings are an additional DOLLAR.  The fruit looked terrible so I didn't bother. There were only two flavors of yogurt.  If I'm ever wanting frozen yogurt again I will just suck up the walk to Pinkberry and enjoy better yogurt for a better price and as many toppings as I want. It's my own damn fault for going into 30 Rock in the first place - should have known better."
206,msnbc-com-digital-cafe-manhattan,2013-02-06,4,"Ssssssh.
This place is a wonderful secret.  Instead of being downstairs with the crowds; you could be upstairs in the quiet cafe with outlets galore.

I think we shared a large (overpriced) cookie, but for the plug, the peace and quiet, it was beyond worth it.  If you enter Rockerfeller building, head up the stairs and look for this cafe."
206,msnbc-com-digital-cafe-manhattan,2012-02-05,2,"I was very disappointed by the Red Mango location at the MSNCB Digital Cafe. On the Red Mango website, it is listed as a self-serve location, which is the reason my friends and I decided to go there. We walked 8-ish blocks there, only to find extreme disappointment. It was not up to par at all with other Red Mango locations, and the fruit did not seem fresh at all. I normally like pineapple on my yogurt, but it was sitting in liquid and was clearly canned. I don't really know anything else about the cafe, I just know that a group of 7 people were very disappointed by the incorrect promise made by the site as well as the food's quality."
206,msnbc-com-digital-cafe-manhattan,2010-04-08,4,"As a cafe / experience store, this place is amazing! So many things to visually please you from the view of Rockefeller Center to the touch screen games the adorn the floor. The coffee here is Seattle's Best so it's decent by default. The main selling point here is that they serve RED MANGO...yum!!"
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2019-05-09,2,"only go to this rip off as a last resort. Not only does Eli Zabar overcharge for EVERYTHING, he WATERS DOWN the coffee, which is 3.27$ for a SMALL CUP, outrageous!! The only good thing about this place is the help is warm and friendly and helpful. 
Better to go to Marche Madison across the street, expensive but not a blatant ripoff"
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2018-11-15,4,"Why not accentuate the positives? And (maybe) eliminate the negatives? Why knock stars when prices are outrageously high? Maybe prices aren't for you. I mean... listen- prices are in fact expensive- but this is Eli's! Can't fault them for that!

For a Monday afternoon, we were lucky to get a hold of a Baguette which was very good! Theirs have that typical crunchy exterior with the light and airy inside. Also bought 2 Sourdough mini buns, 2 Pretzel minis, 2 Brioche mini loaves and a 1/4lb of mild, Coeur du Berry Goat Cheese. Damage? 26 bucks. Service? Helpful. But listen- I didn't expect to be entertained. As long as you give me good service and don't manhandle my food- I'll return!"
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2018-11-13,1,"Do NOT come here.
Unless you want to pay $10.00 for a one day old Burnt chicken ""provencal"" sandwich.
With NO SEATING provided.
Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!
This place has no business being here.

I cannot overemphasize how much this food sucks!!

It knows it has to close... but will SCREW CUSTOMERS while it's still open!
Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!"
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2018-09-13,2,"Apologies!  This is the wrong location. I was reviewing the one on Madison and 91st/  Obscene prices but we pay them so he's smart.   Attractive and tasty-enough  morning displays of baked  goods etc  and nice early am people watching- School kids  /  Hectic.     

 They have poorly trained staff ranging from indifferent to  inappropriate flirtacious with  the many school aged girls that run in  on their way to class before before 9 am.  This morning I was behind what must have been a girl not older than 13 and the man behind register creepily whispered -but loud enough so I heard  "" Mmm Youre' beautiful""  as he handed her the   change.  I looked for Eli who is often there in the morning, but didn't see him today. This isn't ok.  We need this to be a neighborhood spot where students can safely enjoy some independence while paying for their muffin in the morning."
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2018-07-24,3,"Cute little shop with a decent assortment of baked goods and food. 

Friendly service as well! 

It's hard for me to judge since I popped in for some chopped fruits to go. You can't really mess up fruits, so there's that. 

The prices are very high however. My perhaps 3 handfuls of berries was about $7-8. 

They also have some premade sandwiches available such as prosciutto and mozzarella."
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2018-02-22,3,"This place is expensive!  $4 for a small hot chocolate, but at least it was really good and they used almond milk :)"
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2017-11-19,3,"I'm laughing at some of these reviews. Yeah, the prices are definitely on the high side here, but I just figured they were on par for the location. I stopped in for an iced green tea and a small jambon et beurre sandwich before heading over to the Cooper Hewitt museum around the corner. I like the open layout and the outdoor seating. The fare on display here reminded me a LOT of my time in Europe, so combined with the fact that it was a pleasant day, I rather enjoyed the ambience. The sandwich was tasty, but the mini baguette was immensely chewy. I actually had to take a break from eating it even though it was small and I was hungry in order to give my jaw muscles a rest. Seriously."
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2017-09-17,4,"Don't understand the low star rating. We had a pleasant experience and visit grabbing some breakfast on the go. Had a sweet interaction with our cashier. Lots of options. The pastries are so satisfying. Thank you, Eli Zabar!"
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2017-08-22,2,"The iced coffee is one size only (16oz) with no flavor variety at $4.  Compared to surrounding vendors, namely Marche across the street ($3 with flavoring) the establishment is vastly overpriced.  Taken into consideration rent / proximity to the park, the average coffee price is $3. Unfortunately, the quality of coffee was also poor.  The beans had been burned during the process leaving an overly acidic flavor.  The staff of the location was very friendly.  One star for location, and one star for staff- that's all."
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2017-07-19,3,very convenient and nice place to get some bread and classic New York bakery
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2017-07-09,1,"Worst macaroon I have ever had. $4.50 for a big macaroon but it was not fresh, taste was not good."
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2016-07-13,1,"Insanely overpriced, with rude service, which is better than obsequious, but not much.  A small dish of cherries, carry-out, is $10, while at Whole Foods, not far from her,e you get a pound for $2.99.  A ""health"" roll is $2.00...  A bowl of soup (Borscht or Gazpacho) is $12.00.  And the minute you swallow whatever you succumbed to eating here because the next eatery is too far to walk to in the oppressive weather, they throw (yes, throw) the bill unasked for, on the table.

Enough said..."
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2016-05-12,4,"You meet nice people when you're sitting on the bench out front! I often stop here when I'm walking up or down Madison. It's a neighborhood hangout. They don't appear to mind if I grab a snack and have a seat. That is if the bench is free. It is a popular spot when the weather is nice. 
The Eli's pastries and breads are always delicious."
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2016-03-16,1,"Walked in to get a cappuccino. Walked out with one 3 minutes later and over $10 poorer. I know we pay a lot for coffee in this city but $10 is ridiculous. I will never go back, complete ripoff."
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2016-02-12,1,"Place is a total rip off, it's a hipsters paradise though.  It cost nearly 15 bucks to walk out with a muffin and a coffee that's ridiculous I mean come on I know it's New York but there's so many other better options. The other part I didn't like was the place it is very cramped and customer service was eh at best. Do yourself a favor and find a Starbucks instead."
207,elis-essentials-new-york-7,2015-12-25,1,"I came here the evening of Christmas Eve to purchase some holiday themed desserts for a movie night at a friends. Two mini chocolate santas and two ginger bread cookies for.... EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  

This isn't Sant Ambroeus or Laduree. Crappy factory made sweets for $18?! I can't say exactly what they tasted like because I just walked out. Cookies felt hard as a rock, and Santa probably tasted like milk chocolate in aluminum wrapping."
208,dunkin-new-york-65,2020-07-09,1,"This is the only dunkin near my job accessible during the pandemic. This being said, i have extremely early morning (4:30/5:00 am). I have never experienced such poor customer service. As someone who is a former waitress , i can't believe management hasn't done a clean up of staff. Yesterday @ 6:30 am I ordered my usual- a large iced coffee with almond milk and caramel swirl. As soon as i ordered it, the girl handed me a random drink with whipped cream on top. I asked her how she can hand me a coffee when i literally ordered it two seconds before, and i also asked her to clarify it had almond milk. she started yelling at me and asking me why i didn't believe her. It was dairy. I cannot have dairy by any means- so two sips of the coffee had me sick at work all day!! The employees are extremely rude, and I understand it's new york but they definitely are very hard with their english. Once she yelled at me for being skeptical she proceeded to talk about me to her coworker in her language and it's confirmed because she was saying my order in english. I walked out very upset. The next time this happens Im just going to have to go back to starbucks and deli coffees. so upsetting"
208,dunkin-new-york-65,2018-12-13,1,"I really don't write yelp reviews often and don't really care that much but good god this Dunkin location is horrible. Aside from the extremely rude behavior of the entire staff, they put a single sliver of bacon on my bacon egg and cheese. At first I didn't think they put any bacon on it at all but I took apart the whole sandwich to find the tiniest amount. I didn't listen to the other reviews on here thinking that it couldn't be that bad but trust me it can. If you can go to another location, definitely do and if anyone here works for Dunkin Donuts, for the love of god retrain or hire new staff that doesn't make me feel guilty for buying myself breakfast."
208,dunkin-new-york-65,2018-06-26,3,"It's a Double D. Donuts and coffee. 

Friendly and efficient staff.

And the cashier must have liked my smile, because she gave me a free donut with my coffee even though I didn't ask for one, nor did I complete a survey link found on every receipt for one.

Thank you, kind cashier,  for your generosity."
208,dunkin-new-york-65,2017-05-12,1,I had ordered two toasted croissant and one English muffin all three toasted on the app and the result was gross.
208,dunkin-new-york-65,2017-04-10,1,"Tried to scam me for $4 by adding donuts to my order (that they didn't give me). When i pointed out their mistake, instead of apologizing they yelled at me. WTF. Avoid."
208,dunkin-new-york-65,2016-05-13,3,"this double d on 1st ave between 56th and 57th st is small and it's just like all the other dunkin donuts in the area . a few tables with the usual stuff of donuts, drinks and other breakfast and lunch bites. about a year ago it was renovated but looks the same to me. i was taking my morning  walk before i headed to work and decided to pick up a dozen donuts for my coworkers . i had a coupon from the sunday paper so for less then 9 bucks my coworkers will be happy until it's lunch time. i can not really complain about this location cause it's kept clean and well stocked with donuts and bagels , etc. it's dunkin donuts folks ."
208,dunkin-new-york-65,2016-02-07,4,They renovated recently and may have new management. It's a small location with only a couple of seats but good for a quick stop-in and takeaway.
208,dunkin-new-york-65,2015-03-12,1,Horrible location!they constantly give you old coffee and stale donuts. The service is also disgusting. They constantly joke amongst themselves and make fun of customers in their own language until one time I saw them get called out on it by a customer that understood them. They recently renovated this location so it's clean for now but they have two doors where the original doors can't be used for some reason.
208,dunkin-new-york-65,2014-10-07,1,Coffee tasted horrible.  Service was terribly slow.  No one in the store and it took 10 min for a bagel and a small coffee. Maybe they had an off day.
208,dunkin-new-york-65,2013-07-24,1,"The worst Dunkin Donuts I have ever been to. The middle aged man behind the register (owner/manager) is always so rude. The coffee is always cold, and whenever I tell them that the coffee is cold, they add hot water. Not worth paying for watery coffee. This man always comes of somewhat of a woman hater. I noticed that he is always rude to women, young and older. All I want to do is to get in, get my coffee, and get out. But this rude man manages to ruin your mood by giving unnecessary attitude, and bad coffee. I will not go to this location anymore."

209,coffee-cart-on-58th-and-3rd-new-york,2007-09-06,5,"Dear Coffee Cart Guy:

Today I cheated on you with another, but I regret it more than words can say-- As I sit here in my cubicle at 9am, regretting my mistake with every sip of this atrocious coffee, I am now sure that you are ""the One"".  You're coffee is by far more superior than any coffee establishment/retailer in the near vicinity.  I hate myself for ever doubting you for a minute and allowing  my wandering taste buds to cloud my better judgment. I now miss every drop of your savory, bold yet sweet taste, and I am reeling from the thought that I ever traded you in for a one-block tryst.  Sure, his cart was accessible, his location perfectly sandwiched between work & Bloomies, and yes-- I was seduced by numerous coffee cups that returned each day to the cube farm from his cart.. but they got it wrong. No one knows me better than you do, and he couldn't give me the coffee I craved. Now, I've come to truly appreciate each perfectly blended cup you've presented to me in our rather recent, but blissful courtship.

Sorry for my philandering ways. I will never take you for granted again.

--Your forever devoted caffeine fiend"
210,cafe-patoro-new-york-2,2020-01-25,3,Good. Expensive for Brazilian street food. Triple check your orders is you ask for the heart of Palm. You will end end with something else
210,cafe-patoro-new-york-2,2020-01-08,4,"Primarily my review is focusing on Brigadeiro Cake and various Pao de Queijo.
 
The Brigadeiro Cake is Brazilian chocolate specialty , more of a fudge chocolate like cake the sign says it has chocolate truffle filling along with the chocolate sprinkles. It was a good tasting dark chocolate cake, I think I paid $6 for a slice and I can say it is one of the better cakes I had in midtown.

Pao de Queijo  or PDQ for short is Brazilian Cheese Bread but shaped like balls. These are more cheesy and heavier than the cheese bread I got from Beach Bistro 96 at The Deco recently.

Well it was opening day at the Urbanspace W52 and it had a pretty big mob here so I could not sample more from Cafe Patoro and I definitely want to try the Shrimp Pot Pie so expect an update.
 
I also got a can Of Guarana Antarctica, it a soda with a hard to describe taste and I would say it was like mild ginger and apple."
211,kafi-new-york-2,2019-11-18,5,Relatively new coffee shop totally european and especially Italian style. I had a double espresso and a small apple danish swirl. Both were excellent. Tiny place. You will most likely not find seating but it is totally okay. Great for a short stop to get refreshed and energized. Highly recommended!
212,nordstrom-coffee-bar-temporarily-closed-new-york,2019-04-20,5,"Great coffee shop that also serves beer, pastries, cocktails and tea.

Prices are standard for Toby's Estate ($3 espresso, $5 coffee). Very tasty espresso and cold brew.

Pastries include croissants, cookies, muffins and savory items like ham/cheese croissant and bagels.

They also offer the same menu of cocktails ($15-$20) as the bar upstairs, which is fun. 

It's next to the restrooms in the basement with men's clothing and order pick ups.

Highly recommend to grab a coffee while you shop. Also can get the coffee in a ceramic mug if staying."

There was a younger woman at the register that was nice and gave us some recommendations but the other two behind the counter treated us like second class citizens.

Maybe my husband got there a bit early, the lady by register said there's no order from us. It's ok, my husband called customer service right away, and asked her please check it again. 

She threw an attitude. Then she brought our order in mistake, my husband told her the amount is wrong. She grabbed our order back and changed it, of course no apology or anything. Staring at my husband, like "" what you want?!""

The worst service ever from Nespresso! We have been purchasing from nespresso for years, no matter online order or in local stores, they all have great customer services, today what she did was really unprofessional!"
213,nespresso-boutique-at-sur-la-table-new-york,2017-01-21,5,"I just recently ordered a nespresso machines and had no idea which capsules I wanted so I decided to walk by and ask about them. 

Not only were the people behind the counter helpful but they offered to let me taste as many of the types of espresso that I would like and gave me their thoughts in how each variety should be served (i.e. Vanilla tastes better with milk) 

Trying out a couple of these capsules in person was definitely very helpful since the capsules I originally thought I would like were too dark for my tastes. Will be back again when I need more capsules!"
213,nespresso-boutique-at-sur-la-table-new-york,2015-10-10,5,"I bought a Nespresso machine from these folks about a month ago.  I hadn't a clue which model I wanted and they were so patient with my hundred questions.  I got a Vertuo machine and I LOVE it!

Since then, I've stopped in here to purchase coffee a few times.  The sales people are always super friendly and I can get a sample of a type of capsule that I express interest in.

A big thumbs up all around for products and sales people!"
213,nespresso-boutique-at-sur-la-table-new-york,2015-03-02,5,"Uber helpful staff! A+ customer service. And, what an efficient and proactive business model. I needed assistance selecting coffee pods (they've got like 27 varieties!) and the staff was very informative and friendly. I hesitated to use these pods at all as it seems so wasteful (environmentally speaking) but I was informed that they recycle all used pods! They even gave me a pre-paid shipping envelope to mail in my used pods for recycling. With my coffee purchase, I also received a little book/catalog to keep track of/take notes on which coffees I like and also a key fob that stores my purchases and coffee maker model information/registration. They even offered to make me an espresso at the end of my visit!"

 I came there with my fiancee and we tried about...10 samples of espresso, ha, and the staff was happy to serve me.  The person Digdem explained to me that there are variations that come and go, and even demonstrated the cappucino machine for me.  I left knowing way more and with my belly full of espresso!

They also recycle the pods, that is really neat.  I will be coming here to buy my pods from now on!!  Thanks guys!!!"

216,49-st-deli-and-coffee-house-new-york,2018-07-14,3,I've come here a few times now because it is close to work and the food has always been great. The service however is so slow. Our waiter stood by or around our table for about 30 minutes after we were seated without taking even our drink order. I didn't even know he was our server until he did finally come over and then I was just annoyed that it took him that long. Anyway if you have a couple hours (no joke and there were only 3 of us) and want a good grilled cheese sandwich I'd give it a try but just be prepared for the wait.
216,49-st-deli-and-coffee-house-new-york,2017-12-30,5,We loved this place the egg sandwich was so good... very friendly and fast. We will be back before we leave to go home.
216,49-st-deli-and-coffee-house-new-york,2016-12-23,5,"Lovely clean corner deli. Good for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Plenty of snacks, drinks and whatnot to choose from. Prices are reasonable considering it's location in Hell's Kitchen, ~$7 for a sandwich with chips and pickle, ~$2 for a drink or snack. The staff are friendly and the store itself is clean. They recently rebuilt the front entrance and it looks sharp! They have 3 tables with some chairs, but it's more of a carry-out focused place. Compared to Skyline this place is gold: cheaper and way better customer service. Great for a quick bite and fast becoming one of my favorites for lunch when I'm working in the area"
217,evantinas-coffee-cart-new-york,2013-02-28,4,"No need to go into one of the tourist traps Midtown West for overpriced coffee. Evantina's little cart has the least expensive coffee for blocks around and it's damned good (she's Greek, after all) , plus orange juice and muffins. She always has a good morning for customers and braves even the cruelest weather to be out there.  You have to admire, and reward, that kind of work ethic."
218,lil-jays-new-york,2016-11-22,3,"Nice small place, mainly to serve the college of criminal justice. 9.45am in the morning and croissants were cold and rather stale. Looked like they had been sitting there for may be a day or two (I hope not!). The cinnamon bagel and cream cheese was much better. Go there if you want to have a coffee and bagel but don't expect anything from poor croissants."
218,lil-jays-new-york,2015-11-11,5,"Really cute place at John Jay College. Super friendly baristas. They serve Starbucks coffee, hale & hearty soup. And pretty decent oatmeal. Nice, comfy indoor seating as well as outdoor seating."
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2020-07-10,1,Horrible. They open at 7 but the person is late it's 7:30 and already paid through the app for my order now gotta wait like 20 more mins for them to set everything up and have my order ready. that's something else
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2019-12-26,1,"Screw up all your orders even when they are not busy! Soy milk please no problem I'll do it again! Wheres my pastry!? Don't worry here it is. Now go to work and enjoy your drink without the correct ingredients and cold pastry! Smh!!! Wow 
Now should I walk all the way back and waste another 20 minutes of my day! No how about I take my business elsewhere! Jeez place sucks!"
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2019-10-27,1,"If I could give this place NO stars I would.
Everyone had a bad attitude here besides the select few individuals.
I ordered a breakfast sandwich minus the meat. The guy making the order forgot to take it off then procedes using no gloves because this place doesnt belive in gloves, takes the meat off the sandwich puts in a bag then gives it to one of the workers standing on other side of counter who then starts eating it. Who does that?
Again they do not wear gloves when prepping food or drinks. Theyll be scrathing there head then put lids on drinks etc Its so gross!
Even had the girl who over poured the whip cream on my drink use her finger to wile excess off the top. Then hand it to me like nothing. It was tossed out and I immediately walked out.
Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2019-10-20,1,"Reviews are right. I ordered a dark roast and got a Lukewarm pour over with coffee grind still floating around , after waiting 5 minutes. Barista refused to make me another drink and insisted i would have to wait another 5 minutes for another pourover. Giving someone a lukewarm cup of coffee is pathetic in itself"
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2019-09-08,1,"It's obvious that management doesn't give a damn about customer experience. It was so ______ loud with such horrible music playing. The employee that took my order literally seemed angry at me. The whole experience was bad and I will try and avoid this  location in the future. 
I don't care about the musical sensibilities of teenage kids working behind the counter. When I come in and to spend money somewhere I want to feel comfortable and wanted. I felt like I had to walk on egg shells not to upset the staff and meanwhile I couldn't concentrate on anything because the horrible music was playing so loud. Starbucks needs to step their game up. In general, I usually love this place. And tonight I felt like my business wasn't wanted and no me has any integrity anymore, so I wouldn't be surprised if the employees reading this right now would be saying how right I was. Well that's great. You win, I won't come back anymore."
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2019-03-28,1,"They have theeeee worst service ever!!! The supervisor stands on the side of the ovens and just watching the staff while she stuffs her face and eats! Long line and not a sense of urgency at all!!!! I hate this one however it's closest to my job ! The female employees there today, right now is this moment at sooo nasty!!!!"
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2018-11-23,1,"Worst Starbucks, they got the order wrong and the barista was rude! Go to some other Starbucks"
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2017-12-31,1,"First I'll say, I was a barista for Starbucks for over 5 years so I know how hard this job can be. And there's no excuse for attitude. 

When I saw the line at the bar to get drinks, I was told that only one bar was working. I ordered anyway knowing I had a few extra minutes. I waited at least 10 minutes but when I saw people being served who had come in at least 5 minutes after me, I asked about my order. I got attitude (eye rolling and shaking her head) from one of the baristas, the other said they were served first because there was only one bar working'. ??? (without looking for my drink order). 

A while later, I asked again, he finally realized they didn't have my order at the bar. He went to the register, found my receipt and finally made my drink.  
The whole time, the woman next to him was giving me the stink eye and shaking her head at me. How dare I ask to actually have a drink made after paying for it.

I have a disability and use a cane. It was a big deal for me to get out in this cold weather. Standing is challenging for me on a good day and there were no options to sit.  I told the guy (David?) I didn't appreciate the attitude. He told me he was a supervisor and would 'take care of it'. Whatever that means.  No attempt to make up for their mistake. 

When I tasted the drink, it didn't taste like my drink. He offered to add a shot (not sure how that would fix it). I didn't have time so I left."
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2017-01-30,1,"Prick ass service, couldn't make my friends drink properly and was not paying attention to customers needs."
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2015-11-05,2,"I'm just wondering how in the hell it takes 15-20 minutes to warm up a coffee cake. This has happened at least 3 times that I've been here! Meanwhile, everything else that requires heating takes about 4-5 minutes. Ridiculous."
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2014-08-10,2,"This place is one of the slower starbucks and they often forget, or discard your order. Many times they will just be dancing or singing or talking amongst themselves without having any order being made.. I am not a fan of this Starbucks"
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2014-01-20,2,"Honestly, Starbucks has almost been Dead. To. Me. so many times. I've been to so many different locations around Manhattan, and my biggest pet peeve is that their product just isn't consistent. Because of that, I just don't frequent their establishment as much anymore. 

I went to this location for the first time today and like most of the Starbucks around the city, the service was genuinely lacking. While it was a minor miracle that the line wasn't wrapped outside the front door, it didn't make my experience much better. Staff at this location barely engages the customer and in the end, my Mocha Frap Lite didn't taste good at all. A lot of socializing between employees and the place looked pretty filthy. I can never understand why someone from the staff isn't on hand to keep the dining area clean at all times. This location isn't even that big. 

In addition, the barista station appeared to be in shambles. Not sure why spills, overflow and machines weren't cleaned up immediately. The lack of training throughout the company is apparent. 

Overall, between the wait time, my beverage not tasting right, lack of cleanliness and the most unfriendly cashier I've encountered at a Starbucks, I just wasn't that impressed with this location. I didn't even want to wait around to have my drink replaced. Too much of a nightmare."
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2012-01-02,1,"Goodness gracious, never waited so long for a coffee in my life. Came here yesterday afernoon and will not go back. The place was crazy hot, I thought I was going to suffocate in my parka waiting for about 20 mins. Finally the order came thru, hubby and I ordered 2 drinks, a pumpkin spice latte and a caramel frapp, instead we got 3 drinks, none of which were correct. Ugh...more waiting."
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2011-03-14,3,"They seem to be really really really slow here. At one point, the barista even admitted the drinks got mixed up in order and that annoyed everyone. Oh well."
219,starbucks-new-york-161,2010-06-01,2,This Starbucks surprisingly houses a large seating space and a separate counter detached from the ordering station.  This location resides in New York's Columbus Circle vincity.
220,bay-market-kitchen-new-york,2020-01-04,5,"Great little coffee shop inside Bed Bath and Beyond. They have oat milk and locally roasted Brooklyn coffee (Panther, I think). Lots of little pastries too. No seating, but there's never a line bc it is so new so I go here over Birch sometimes. Also open late!"
221,crepes-and-waffles-new-york-2,2017-09-13,4,"Not bad at all. In fact, our egg and cheese crepe was pretty good; the crepe was fresh made and nice and thin, three eggs were scrambled right on top, with American cheese added. If it'd had bacon or sausage on it (our fault it didn't) it would have been great. 

They should probably just call this place ""Crepes."""
221,crepes-and-waffles-new-york-2,2017-04-05,2,"Terrible waffle. The crepes are made on the spot, but not the waffles, the waffles are re heated and get flimsy. Not good since it's not freshly made."
222,inès-new-york-4,2020-02-19,4,"Ines serves strong coffee and delectable pastries in this bright, standing room only cafe. This is the second location (the first on 74th St and York) and the staff were really excited on their first day.

Ines is accessible on 56th Street, across from Souvlaki GR, but the signage is not too obvious. You can also enter from the lobby of Carnegie Tower, look for a glass door with the bright white tile work behind it.

Joseph and Bex were happy to greet my afternoon group excursion. Currently coffee, espresso, and pastries are on the menu, with the idea to offer breakfast sandwiches in a few weeks. Coffee is sourced from Devocion, they also have tea. I tried the chai bundt cake (excellent, cardamom bliss) and Joseph said the apple and citrus bundt cakes are Ines favorites. They also had danishes, donuts, croissants, and muffins.

There are no chairs, but there's a standing ledge for eating on the go. Prices are normal for Midtown, but going to be expensive for the out of towners going to Carnegie Hall. Location is bright and cheerful, staff are awesome, and I wish them well!"
223,dunkin-new-york-86,2020-07-12,5,"I go to this Dunkin' everyday and there are a few reasons why I go here instead of Starbucks now. They have my mobile order ready 99% of the time when I arrive just a few mins after placing it. Today, they even gave me a large iced coffee instead of the medium I ordered. The workers are very nice and they keep this store clean. 
I'm surprised than I have now converted to being a Dunkin' customer everyday when I used to be a Starbucks guy. I do order my coffee black through the app and add my own milk since every Dunkin' I've been to (including this one) tends to add too much. They have been getting busier at this location in recent weeks and I hope they continue to do well here."
223,dunkin-new-york-86,2019-12-14,2,Never enough staff. Never saw more than 1 person behind counter. Walked out several times bc they are sooooo slow.
223,dunkin-new-york-86,2019-09-24,3,"This place has a ton of potential. It's probably one of the largest, cleanest, most modern Dunkins in the city but it's definitely experiencing growing pains.

Everytime I go in there is a customer experiencing a different problem at the register and the staff seems unsure how to handle these issues. Often it'll require 2-3 street members to solve one problem and the line piles up as a result. 

Give it a couple of months and I'm sure these problems will dissipate but for now allow for extra time if this is a stop on your commute."
223,dunkin-new-york-86,2019-09-15,4,a new double d has opened on the corner of 48th st and second ave and its about time as this corner space has gone thru many different type of shops over the years with none lasting long so maybe dunkin donuts turtle bay will finally change that . good wide spacious room inside with plenty of seating all around . the front counter area is wide and menu board has the full gamut of whats available .better selection of donuts and bagels and service is quick as this location has full staff each with its own task. good fast wifi and place is clean which it should be as its brand new . personally i am glad they decided not to be open 24/7 yet cause the after midnight drunks from the area bars can be trouble at times . glad they open shop here and now i can rotate from this location and the first ave dd when i crave a jelly donut and coolata.
224,robusta-espresso-bar-new-york-3,2019-06-28,4,"smoked salmon sandwich was delightful, for sure the best ive had in a long time. love the fact that the coffee is only one dollar. will be back for more."
225,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york-2,2019-07-21,5,"This is the best gelato in town. I visited their store in Little Italy at the beginning of the year and the gelato was stunning!!! Today I had gelato at their cart in Basley Park, and it was so good!! The texture and the flavor of the gelato is amazing!! I had a medium cup with strawberry sorbet and the milk chocolate and it was really refreshing with this hot weather. The staff was really friendly and helped me with the fancy Italian names!!! Nothing else to say if you ever find your self in mid town you have to stop at Polo Sud it's a must!!!!"
225,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york-2,2019-05-11,5,"Best gelato in NY City: it's a cute little cart located in a corner park in Midtown. They make the gelato in their main location downtown and deliver it here fresh every morning. Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
226,orens-daily-roast-new-york-15,2017-06-20,5,"The coffee here is the best I've had in this area. Service was wonderful and coffee tasted great. Don't listen to the other reviewer - they evidently favor coffee at the sweeter end of the spectrum, which is of no fault of the establishment."
226,orens-daily-roast-new-york-15,2016-02-06,1,Service seems nice. Had an Americano. Coffee was hot. Wife had a latte. We both found  each of our drinks overly bitter. Hers was sweet and bitter. I drink my coffees black. The cashier rang me up quickly but didn't wait for my wife to take out her Oren's card. I threw mine out after 1 sip.
227,gypsy-tea-kettle-new-york,2006-08-28,2,"I've seen bigger and better, but it's a fun thing to bring out of town guests to experience and enjoy."
228,herb-nkitchen-new-york,2016-08-29,1,"We ate at the buffet in the hotel thinking it was complimentary because it was just a small spread of food and we paid a decent amount for our rooms. After we had gotten food and sat down the waiter asked us if we were gold or diamond members. We said no and he said he would bring over the check. This was not a 5 star breakfast with mimosas and the likes. This was a typical small hotel buffet, without an omelette bar no less. I was expecting maybe $10-15 a person. Maybe that was a little high, but it's New York right? $140 FOR 4 PEOPLE. That's $35 per person. I was blown away. That was high way robbery, not breakfast. I better be getting a lit cigar and a personal massage for that price. The waiters didn't even clear the plates. Unbelievable. Absolutely do not go to the Herb n' Kitchen unless you bring along plenty of lube."
229,caffettino-new-york-2,2014-08-22,2,"I discovered this coffee shop because my aunt lives down the street.  The original location was farther east and have since relocated.  

The latte I had was pretty good but overpriced.  I noticed they use one of those overpriced automated espresso machines.  I prefer my coffee drinks hand-crafted.  Anyone can push a button.  duh

None of the sandwiches seem to be made there and I saw delivery boxes for the pastry.  You can get this sort of thing anywhere, so why bother?

I'll go elsewhere next time."
230,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-26,2020-02-29,4,"Blue Bottle is a classic coffee shop especially if you're from the Bay Area! This location is pretty new and does seem catered towards the business people working in Midtown (especially in the 1345 Ave of the Americas building since it's connected to the building but you still gotta walk outside to get into this shop). Don't come here expecting to be able to sit and chat, it's more of a grab and go! 

Came with a friend a couple hours after lunchtime on Friday since she was too busy to meet me for lunch but suggested coffee nearby! We were headed towards Starbucks, but saw Blue Bottle and decided to try it instead. It was actually pretty empty inside the store! There was one other customer there when we came. I enjoyed my iced coffee, but Blue Bottle does truly have great beans / pour over / iced coffee. My friend liked her matcha latte too! We were both confused a bit by the menu because both oat and almond milk are available but only almond milk is listed as costing an extra $1. We didn't bother asking about it, but I am still thinking about it now and wish I had asked. 

The hours are reasonable aka open until 7pm most days, but be aware that this place isn't open on weekends according to a sign on their door!"
230,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-26,2020-02-10,5,"I was honestly shocked when I saw that Blue Bottle was hovering on the brink of one star. I guess in the  few short weeks this location has been open, we got some angrily specific people ticked off. Sorry Mr. Sweet and Low, how about you just don't add sugar? (Do you even know how bad the fake stuff is for you?) And to the decaf interrogator - like what? Your story doesn't even make sense. To our acocado toast carrier - duh, if you put avocado toast in a box and toss it around of COURSE it's gonna get messy. 

All this is to say, yes I spent $9 on an egg sandwich today (not saying this place is cheap), but it was the warm delicious perfect start to a Monday that was worth every penny. And the coffee is great! 

Keep doing your thing, BB. I'm routing for you."
230,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-26,2020-01-14,2,"I just can't recommend this chain for one reason - they don't offer any zero calorie sweetener options. Organic sugar only. For those who need to reduce their sugar intake, it's a no-go, assuming you don't like unsweetened coffee. If they want to stick with the frou-frou natural theme, then they should provide stevia. They get 2 stars because the staff was gracious about processing my refund when I learned there was no zero calorie option."
230,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-26,2020-01-08,1,"Everything I said about this place in my original review -- I was the first to review this place -- I take back. Today I was treated unbelievably rudely by a guy behind the counter after asking a very innocent question in a very mild-mannered away. Question was: why don't you serve decaf pour overs when you have decaf beans? His answer, delivered in the nastiest, most dismissive voice you can imagine, was ""We just don't. That's the simple answer, okay? We just don't."" I was shocked and embarrassed that someone would speak to a customer that way. Because of that, I will never return to this location again."
230,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-26,2019-12-30,2,I bought a $9 avocado toast that subsequently exploded all over my shirt and desk when I opened the box it was packaged in.  It was small and tasted ok but for $9 they should be able to package it properly.
231,dunkin-new-york-100,2019-04-25,1,"Everything is usually great here but I went in last week to grab coffee for my coworker and I and an employee here was extremely rude and embarrassed me for no reason. I can only guess he was having a bad day. He refused to take my coupon for a free donut. I filled out an online survey for this donut and gave their location a great rating. He said they do not except the coupon which is not true, I have used the same coupon at this same location at least 8 times in the past few months. I explained this to him and he asked why I was ""making a big deal about a donut""?. Excuse me? I am a customer you should appreciate. Embarrassed and angry I eventually gave up which did not take long because I had to get back to work. This man heckled me and tried to make me look stupid and cheap over an offer this company gives to customers. I will NEVER go back or recommend this location (which I did regularly) all because this employee I can only guess didn't like my appearance? I can not even fathom why I was treated like this."
232,starbucks-new-york-549,2019-01-13,1,"Specifically ordered through the app to make sure the order was made with ALMOND milk. Even asked the barista if the order was prepared with almond milk (even mentioned the dairy allergy) I was assured the drink was made according to the ticket printed.... all of us are ill. All three people in our party are sick because our order was prepared with cow milk.  READING IS FUNDAMENTAL, this place obviously breezed over our order and then brush off our allergy. I'm losing faith In this company."
233,coffee-place-new-york,2015-09-16,2,"It's close... they (he) opens early (6AM), and I can ALWAYS count on quick service.  Aside from that, honestly, it's hard to really screw-up BLACK COFFEE (nothing in it)."

Come in any morning.  There is like on person at the cash register with a line of people.  I've often arrived in the afternoons and no one is up front.  Or, if someone orders a complicated coffee, that person goes a way and there is no one to service you.  Yesterday I heard a staff women swearing as she walked into her job.

I like Pret.  So clean up your mess."

They also have incredible blueberry muffins and breads, like the banana chocolate chip and the sour cream coffee cake! When in NYC, visiting Levain Bakery is a must. You won't regret it! 
FAVORITE BAKERY OUT THERE!!!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-07-14,5,"Best cookies ever by far!! Love every single cookie from the double chocolate to the chocolate chip to the walnut or oatmeal raisin... all are worth tasting. I typically ask which cookies are still warm and the staff is very honest and provide the freshest option available. The cookies are super rich and gooey at the center. I've held onto a batch for a few days and they hold well.. still chewy and delicious 3 days later. 

Levain bakery cookies live up to the expectation. They are so insanely good and theres a reason they had to move to a larger location!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-07-12,5,"I finally got the cookie! Indulgent is not even the word...I don't think there is a word  to describe this yumminess. It's slightly crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. I got the walnut chip chocolate cookie, and boy was it good. The walnut cuts into the sweetness of chocolate, but the cookie is actually not too sweet to begin with. The cookie weighs a ton,.and honestly I think half is enough. I regretted eating the whole thing as after a half I was definitely full. The service was great, and that is much appreciated during the COVID19 scare."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-07-01,5,"The hype is real. You WILL wait on a long line. Is it worth it? Hell yes.

The cookies are ridiculously good- they taste like good quality homemade. Crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside. 

Don't let the long line discourage you. Plan your visit with the wait time in mind, and you'll be rewarded with a mouthful of bliss."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-06-14,5,"COVID 19 situation: Walked 2 miles to try this bakery and I can definitely say I won't mind doing that again!!

There was a line outside the store but it was moving quickly and the delivery was completely contactless. I got a dark chocolate chip cookie and a chocolate chip brioche.

The cookie was so goey, it melted in my mouth and the brioche was very fresh and delicious!

Would love to stop by the bakery again and try other cookies and breads!"

Even with the pandemic I couldn't stay away. They have a great set up for people who order ahead or stop by the bakery. I visited ""before the apex"" when Cuomo was begging for 40,000 ventilators. I commend them for being so ahead of the curve with their Covid friendly set up. It meant so much to me to venture out in my car, run inside the bakery and have my order sitting there ready to go. That small treat meant so much after constant shelter in place eating food that you cooked yourself for weeks on end. I could return to my home knowing I was still safe and responsible and I'm happy to report I've never tested positive.  Thank you for being a bright spot and keeping us safe during these challenging times."

I reached out to customer service to see how what could be done and the response I received instructed me to bake the cookies again to make them gooey and they hope I order more in the future. I am so disappointed and dissatisfied. I doubt I will ever patronize Levain again and will encourage my friends and family to do the same."

I got the four assorted cookies- Chocolate Chip walnut, Dark Chocolate peanut butter, oatmeal raisin and Dark Chocolate Chip. If you are a peanut butter fan like me, you will LOVE the dark chocolate peanut butter- it was my favorite! My least favorite was Oatmeal raisin just because I am not a big oatmeal raisin fan!

235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-04-20,5,"Why wait at the original location (almost literally around the corner) when you can your cookies faster here and not feel as cluttered! Don't get me wrong, still a line, but from experience, much faster. (I had taken my friends to the original bakery on 74th and those who didn't want to wait, I walked them to this location. Even after the walk and waiting in line, still got out faster than my friends who waited at 74th.) 

Disclaimer: I have not tried the other baked goods at this location, but the cookies are definitely the thing to get here.

Cookie selection includes:
-Oatmeal Raisin (my favorite)
-Chocolate chip walnut 
-Dark Chocolate Chocolate chip
-Dark Chocolate peanut butter ship (2nd go to, but it can get a little much, so I usually save the rest for later)

The cookies at this location still taste amazing and consistent to the other location. Although my favorite go to is the oatmeal raisin, all their cookies are amazing! I love the hard outside, but gooey soft inside. 

Although these cookies do have a hefty price point, the cookie is very massive and well worth it!

Tips:
-If you are a visitor and want to bring cookies back, here are some helpful tips:
1) Bring parchment paper and ziplock bags (you can ask for extra individual bags, but since it is packed with butter, you may not want to risk it seeping through into your luggage, but you can still wrap 1 cookie per bag then place it in your ziplock). Wrap the cookies individually tight!
**this tip was actually recommended by one of the workers**
2) If you did not wrap the cookies tight, you may experience the cookie getting too hard. I tend to recommend to my friends to microwave it for a little (15-30 sec) to get it soft again in the inside and get the chocolate to melt like it would if you had it fresh."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-04-19,4,"I've been to Levain's smaller, now closed location but not this one. In the Age of the Rona I probably won't get to see this location any time soon. But don't let that stop you! Even though Levain's listing says no deliveries, Caviar is providing the service at no additional cost. 

The cookies are massive. Not like a big, flat, wide cookie. Those are always disappointing and dry. These are compact mounds. They're like a hybrid between a cookie and a muffin top. Crunchy on the outside, soft and moist in the middle. I could only manage half a cookie at a time, so my four cookies lasted a whole week. 

The oatmeal raisin was my absolute favorite. It's a whole breakfast with a cup of coffee. It's also the one most like a muffin top. Hearty and delicious. Also the least sweet of the four. Still plenty sweet though. Next came the Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip and the Chocolate Chocolate Chip. These were the two I had to go halfsies on. They are DENSE. Don't be a hero. Go half and live another day. Lastly was the regular Chocolate Chip. There's nothing wrong with it but the other three showed it up. 

I know part of the Levain experience is standing in line but the free delivery is going to spoil a lot of people for it in the future.

235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-04-12,1,"This business was discriminatory toward me on 04-12-20.  I was treated differently than other customers of a different race.  This was on my bucket list of eats when I was on the Upper West Side.  Unfortunately, it is not a place of business that does not believe in equal and fair treatment to customers.  After I made my purchase I left; never to turn.  I will also file a complaint with the City of New York regarding the treatment I received.  Shameful!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-04-10,5,Heaven on cookie earth.  Never in my life have I had better cookies.  They're thick warm gooey and full of flavor.  This place is a gift from above.
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-04-01,5,"*My experience was similar to my original experience in the UES location:

Get the walnut chocolate chip cookie.

Gooey. Chocolately. And a piping hot mess. You're welcome"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-03-21,4,Levain is amazing and you have to get some cookies at least once. I know the line can be daunting but honestly i would kill for a treat during this covid time. Not open sadly but totally understandable! Can't wait til they open back up so I can buy these huge expensive cookies haha! I need to try their bread and coffee as well. The gluten free chocolate chip cookie is pretty good but the original is so good. Hard to beat it!
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-03-16,5,"Last stop before the Coronavirus kept us all inside. For $4, you get the chocolate chip cookie pictured here. It's heavy. You could probably knock someone out if you threw it at them. But that's not the point of this cookie. You eat this cookie -- and it's the best best chocolate chip cookie on earth. How does it taste like it came straight from the oven even though I brought it home 45 minutes ago? IDK MAN!! Magic, I guess. Every ingredient is noticed. Firm outside, gooey inside, with a nice progression along the way. One cookie is enough for two people, but you'll want more later, so I recommend getting like 15."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-03-15,1,"We came here Sunday, March 15, 2020 around 5:45pm. We waited on line, bought our cookies and went to the side to eat it. We were more than 2 bites in and this employee says ""we're practicing social distancing so you need to get out!"" 

WOW, if the location was practicing this, they should have a sign about everything being ""to go"" only. Besides the fact telling customers AFTER they've paid to ""Get out"" is beyond rude. The choice of words ""get out"" was beyond me. My BF & I did not say a word and simply left. But we were bothered by the choice of words spoken to us when we did not see the other people before us being told this AT ALL..... 

There was a better way to go about having us leave instead of being rude. I will not support this location ever again. The girl who was there was rude and belittling. I don't know what times she thinks this is, or WHO she thinks she is, but ""get out"" is a very belittling command. Show some respect. 

Trust me I never give poor reviews but this had me upset. To the manager of this location please go back and look at camera footage and show disciplinary action to the girl in the store by the ledge. She was RUDE. 

FYI: I should also add I requested no bag at time of purchase because I would be eating inside & I am very conscious on paper waste.... and at no point did they say I could not eat inside. It was the employee near the ledge out of no where who told us to ""get out."" 

So disappointed to be turned off by a company I've supported when they only had one small location from many years ago. Shame."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-03-10,4,"If you are looking for a decadent, warm, soft cookie, Levain is the place to go. The menu is very simple, but the taste is amazing. I noticed some people mentioning the price but the cookies are huge, something that you could easily split with someone and still be satisfied. My favorite was the oatmeal raisin, although I their famous chocolate chip cookie wasn't far behind. Also, of note, there was a line but it moved very quickly and there were 3-4 stations to order, so the wait was minimal (less than 5 minutes)."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-03-01,5,Got a cookie here. Lives up to the hype. Must go if you're in the area. The cookie was warm and gooey. Baked perfectly and delicious (:
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-02-25,5,"Levain has my whole heart. These cookies are ICONIC and cooked perfectly every. single. time. 

$4 sounds like a lot but they're honestly so big it's the size of multiple cookies. 

Get them for yourself and you'll be happy, or get them for your friends and they'll love you forever."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-02-25,5,"Yes, it's $4 for a cookie but it's so worth it! 

Made my first visit last week. We got 2 dark chocolate chip cookies and a coffee. The coffee was average and I wish they let me pour my own cream. The cookies were amazing! It was warm and so satisfying to break apart, seeing the gooey center. Ended up getting in line again and buying an additional two cookies. 

Tip:
Buy your cookies and go walk Central Park while eating your baked goods. The Best!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-02-22,5,"Best cookies you'll have in your life. Yes you'll probably have to wait in a long line, do it. It's worth it. The cookies are huge and amazing. These cookies will change your life."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-02-21,5,Who can say no to these amazing cookies just don't eat anything prior to and expect long lines especially on the weekend. I live nearby and the line never gets shorter. Perfect place to splurge but doubt you'll be able to eat more than one (in a good way!)
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-02-14,5,"I always come to Levain to bring cookies to my
Offices for work because they all love how amazing the cookies taste.  Today being Valentine's Day and how busy it was, I have to write a review of how amazing this place is. Malak packed over 50 cookies for me in 5 different packages. Meticulously picking out the best cookies on the sheet in a speedy time.  Everyone that works here is awesome but I just had to take a moment and say how great my experience was today!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-02-10,5,so happy they opened more locations.  that line for the original store was cray-cray!
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-02-09,5,"You can't possibly walk in here without trying a cookie. The dark chocolate peanut butter cookie is ridiculous. These cookies are a full meal pretty much! So good! You will have to add 30 minutes to your workout if you have one of these. Trust me it is worth it. 

They also have muffins and coffee. I don't think you can go wrong with anything. Just close your eyes and pick!  This stuff isn't cheap so beware of that but who cares it is so good. They are worth every penny. 
5 stars all the way!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-02-06,3,"The alleged ""cookie"" is a scone. It's a decent scone. Not the best scone. Not the best cookie. Not bad, but certainly not worth waiting in line for. I get that the overly large size is adorable, a novelty and photo-worthy. That's really mainly what you're paying for."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-01-25,5,"Soooo good. Every time I come to New York, I buy their cookies, and some other paastries. I've tried their sticky buns. They're good but I prefer the cookies.  My favorite is the original chocolate chip walnut. There's a gluten free version too but it's not as good. It's less gewy, and perhaps a bit more sweet. It's the only gluten free version they make and it's made and baked in the same kitchen as gluten cookies and bread (just fyi). The staff is really nice. When there's a huge line at the other location, I come here cause it's usually quicker. Too bad they're so expensive, although it's probably for the best given how rich they are. I couldn't eat them everyday. I recommend the chocolate chocolate cookie too which is gewy too. They are a bit too sweet for me, but from time to time, they are delicious. The lemon bread is also great. Oatmeal raisin is gewy too."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-01-18,5,Their cookies are absolutely divine! A friend of ours recommended this place because she's a local to NYC. We got the chocolate chip walnut cookie and it was heavenly. Crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. The perfect cookie!
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-01-16,5,"I like Aunt Mary's super thin super crispy chocolate chip cookies. I like Alison Roman's chocolate chunk salt cookies. I like traditional Tollhouse chocolate chip cookies.

What is this big mound thing? Doing the UWS treat thing for my daughter in law who just had gorgeous twins. Spoiling them all by going to Levain. Bringing bag back for nursing mom. 

Me oh my. The big huge chunk thing is so good. Is this a cookie or a dough mound? Whatever. $4 a mound. One cannot eat the whole thing. 

Keep the bag. Break it in bag so scrumptious bits stay in bag for later consumption. I only had two bits. Gave some to great grandmother. The rest for new Mama. Hey I bought 3 cookie. Oatmeal raisin. Chocolate peanut butter cup. Chocolate chip walnut. All divinity. Not a typical cookie.

But very good for nursing mothers of twins. Hope I scored some grandmother points! Will return for sure. But will still be baking on my own."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-01-12,4,"Amazing cookies and hot chocolate but the staff was not very friendly ..

It's without a doubt worth going just to get their cookies :-)

It's New York so I guess it's hit or miss with peoples personalities but I would recommend going and giving it a try."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-01-11,5,I've been wanting to go to this place for awhile and I regret not trying thier cookies sooner! I had the chocolate chip walnut and it was crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. You could tell that the cookies were fresh out of the oven. I would eat these more.often if I could lol
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-01-09,5,"If you're in search of the perfect chocolate chip cookie, look no further.  2nd trip to NYC in less than 6 months.  Literally took the subway up here for another trip to Levain.  The only thing I would change about this place is the fact that they haven't started franchising rights.  Lol!  When you guys decide to...  Come to Cincinnati!  I'll open it up."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-01-07,3,Levain Bakery is know for their large oversized cookies. While in NY visiting in the summer we visited Levain and I had a great experience the staff was friendly and answered all of the questions I had about particular cookies. But this time a 4 months later I did not have the same experience. The staff was very rude and unprofessional most of them on their phones not attending to customers. I was with my friend who is allergic to nuts so I asked them which cookie they recommended and they did not answer my question. The cookies were cold and not up to par I was very discouraged during my visit at Levain.
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2020-01-01,5,"Seriously, one of the best cookies I've ever had! I would highly recommend. Worth the wait!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-12-30,5,"I went to the other location one day and this one two days after. The cookies are just as good :) crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The other place just feels more ""authentic"" because it's smaller and this one is more like a Starbucks, but there's usually a shorter line here vs in the other."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-12-27,5,"They have the best cookie you'll probably have in your life. There was no line at this location at around 8 pm, and our cookie was still nice and warm. 

We got the chocolate chip walnut cookie. They did a good job on making sure the outside is nice and crispy, the inside is nice and soft, and plenty of chocolate chips in each bite (the best part)."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-12-27,5,"Levain bakery has 3 locations but this location is very pretty. Their menu is extensive to include cookies, bread, muffins, pizza, and drinks, but the best thing on their menu is the chocolate and oatmeal raisins cookies. They are thick, warm, buttery, and not too sweet. Would highly recommend."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-12-23,5,"Pretty darn good cookies. Low key tip, if they are out of the chocolate chip and walnuts just ask for gluten free, almost identical to the originals. Super good though and definitely worth the hype."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-12-22,4,"I will preface this review by saying I absolutely adore Levain cookies and pastries. What I am less a fan of is, for those of my friends who are allergic to nuts, there is a wide dearth of pastries they can consume without dying. 

I ordered the peanut butter dark chocolate cookie because I was feeling like I wanted a heart attack that day, big exam coming up in grad school. The cookie itself, was consumed about 30 minutes later when I arrived at the apartment. It was still warm and paired exceptionally well with a bottle of milk I had been saving -- fancy milk. 

The cookie was not overwhelming sweet or too overpowering in the chocolate sense. I am not a fan of chocolate, but I adore peanut butter. Overall, a delectable cookie and well worth the hype. The line moved very quickly and the cookie-tenders were very helpful in helping me suss out what I really wanted to eat.

One star off because as mentioned earlier, there are few to no nut-free options, much to the dismay and sadness of my boyfriend."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-12-21,3,"It was a good chocolate chip walnut cookie but maybe just too much gooey chocolate for my morning. Their cappuccino nicely contrasted the cookie. So together it made for a nice bite. Later that evening, however, I ate an entire cookie and wanted another. We also got the double chocolate chip and was told it was too rich as well.

I guess we just didn't like the half baked texture as much as we thought we would. It's good forsure, but my tastebuds take me elsewhere."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-12-12,5,"We've actually just moved right next to this bakery! We do love the accessibility, and the various bakes. The flatbreads are heavy, and cheese dense - make sure you are sharing or super hungry! The artichoke and classic are their most popular. The cookies are their speciality, the walnut and chocolate is large, gooey, and generous. The chocolate choc chip is super rich and sweet! Both are delicious and worth a try. Having observed, it seems like the line moves fast."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-12-06,5,Line goes fast. Honestly thought the double chocolate chip was better than the chocolate chip walnut but both were great. They also have a gluten free option.
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-12-06,5,"All time favorite cookie place ever! I used to work at a bakery and am quite a baker myself so when I say best cookies, best cookies! 

I first heard about this place via Food Network. Thought the cookies were interesting because the founders were triathletes and wanted a delicious, energy-dense snack that would help them through their triathlon. Then, I heard about the place again when I went on a really bad date. Long story short (I know... who am I?), the guy was some scrub that was trying to find a sugar mama. Sorry bud, but I don't qualify...by... a lot a lot. The guy mentioned how he lived around the bakery so I walked him home because I am terrible with directions. Thank you stupid dude, all the best, but NEXT!

The chubby cookie's center is oh so slightly undercooked. chocolate chips are melty and get all over your hands and it is the most decadently messy moment. I personally do not care looking like the street's slob eating this walking down Amsterdam, but for those neat and delicate ones, take it home, close the drapes, turn the lights off, and have a moment of sensuality with your cookie(s). No words needed. Just indulge. The chocolate chip walnut is all you need. Don't even humor the others (well, they are good too). Sorry to those who have nut allergies. Personally, I would have a pen in hand or a doctor on standby if needed. In honor of Frozen II in theaters, ""some things are worth melting (getting really sick) for."""
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-12-03,2,"I was really hoping that this bakery would live up to all of the Instagram hype, but it was lacking. There was a long line in both locations, but the line moved through pretty quickly. I asked for a warm cookie, and I was handed a huge warm loaf sized cookie. I was so excited to finally try the gooey cookie to find out that it lacked in flavor and sweetness completely. I LOVE dessert, and took one bite out of the walnut chocolate chip and didn't finish."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-12-02,5,"I don't think I could DREAM of a better cookie than Levain's. Their cookies are crispy on the outside and like a soft, warm pillow of sweet goodness on the inside. They're always served warm and gooey!

Although the cookie flavor options are limited to four flavors -- chocolate walnut, chocolate peanut butter, double chocolate, and oatmeal raisin -- I have yet to be disappointed by any of the flavors (bear in mind, I am generally NOT a person that likes nuts in my cookies!). And even though the cookies are about $4, they are worth every cent.

Pro tip: go to this location (Amsterdam between 75 and 76) instead of the original location. It's almost always less crowded and the cookies are just as amazing. :) 

Lastly, these cookies are HEAVY. The most recent time I went, I managed to split 2 cookies amongst 5 people. No one left unsatisfied!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-11-25,5,"These cookies are so amazing that we went twice in one weekend. And the second time it was POURING rain, but I had to have some of these cookies to take home. Can't decide is I like the chocolate chocolate chip or the chocolate walnut best. They are worth every penny and worth the wait."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-11-23,5,It's a shame we are only limited to a maximum of five stars. My husband band I just enjoyed Levain cookies and there is no comparison. My mouth is still tingling. The best cookies ever!!!
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-11-22,5,"Pretty delicious cookies, extremely thick and gooey. When you get it straight from the bakery, they will be melty. I love this, but others may like it firmer. If so, you can just put it in the fridge for a few hours and enjoy later. I headed over to the one they just opened on the UES. I will go to Levain on special occasions to treat myself. You are paying for quality and $4 is not too expensive for a perfect, thick, and yummy cookie that will satisfy your cravings. I've tried all four flavors of their cookies and all are delicious, my favorite is the classic chocolate chip and walnut. Definitely recommended for some of the best cookies in the city!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-11-15,5,"If you are a cookie lover like I am, you have to try Levain. These are some of the richest, gooiest cookies I've had the pleasure of tasting- I swear they're baked on the perfect cusp between raw and well done.

Be forewarned- these are not cheap and unfortunately there are no bulk discounts. However, if you have visitors in town or want to indulge in a treat yourself moment, you won't be disappointed. Also highly recommend the double chocolate peanut butter cookie for all of my peanut butter lovers out there! Can't wait to go back."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-11-13,4,"Pretty darn good flavor in this cookie and they're not too bad on size either! I came on a rainy day before 12pm so I got in this place for a less than 20 min wait.

I got the classic chocolate chip walnut and the dark chocolate peanut butter cookies. Even though there are a billion other chocolate chip cookie recipes out there, I felt like this one had pretty decent flavor to the dough itself and the chocolate flavor wasn't avergae either. I didn't notice the walnut too much because even when you don't get huge pieces or chunks of that, it can make a difference in desserts. I personally enjoy nuts in my desserts for the balance with salty/sweet/nuttiness and they usually pair well with chocolate anyway.

As for the peanut butter chocolate, it was equal in size and the kind of filling to expect inside. There was a little bit of a twist that I wasn't expecting which was that there are bits and chunks of peanut butter in it just like chocolate chips. Usually oeanut butter cookies just have the smell and the flavor of it but you dont see bits of it like in this one. I can appreciate this style and I liked it, kind of reminded me of peanut butter cups in a way. The dark chocolate flavoring wasn't as good as the class chocolate chips but it was on the less sweet side if that's more up your alley.

I can see why people come here for their cookie but I'm curious how well they do their other baked goods so I'll try some of those next time."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-11-11,5,Cookies are expensive but SOOOOO worth it. I've never had a cookie as delicious as the one from Levain. Such yummy ooey gooey deliciousness all around.
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-11-10,5,"This is our go to bakery in NYC. We cannot visit the city without bringing home at least a dozen. Yes, they are heavy so we go later in the day. That warm moist cookie is worth the wait. We always get the walnut chocolate chip. These cookies are the best ever!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-11-06,5,"Is this actually considered a cookie or a gift from the gods?

Crispy and buttery on the outside and soft and mushy on the outside. Perfect for my tastebuds. 

If you like a thin cookie with a snap run in the other direction. This is more like a scone met a cookie and had a baby. 

This heavenly treat can run out as I experienced on my last trip into this shoebox of an establishment. 

Run to this place before they're out."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-11-05,5,"I had been wanting to try these cookies for a very long time. It sounded like a good treat after visiting the Museum of Natural History and before spending some time in Central Park. 

We split the dark chocolate peanut butter chip cookie and the dark chocolate chocolate chip cookie. They were heavy in feeling, but light in taste. Gooey and warm and all-around amazing. They lasted us a couple of days and once we finished them I was sad and wanted another one. I can't wait to go back to a Levain Bakery - or maybe even order them online. :D"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-11-02,4,"Levain has New York City's best chocolate chip cookie! My personal favorite is the OG chocolate chip walnut cookie. It was gooey, rich and super filling. I also got the oatmeal raisin, which was definitely less heavy in a good way. 
I'll be back to try more cookies in the future!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-10-31,5,This is an amazing cookie!! We got one of the pb/chocolate cookies and one of the chocolate chip walnut cookies I believe it is (definitely a nut just can't remember one hundred percent which one). This cookie is certainly amazing and I would be thrilled if someone gave me one of these every day. They are super sweet and one definitely does the trick. If you are a cookie lover like me you could have two but definitely would be sweet enough. If you want to try all of their flavors go with some friends and split the cookies. Overall these are amazing cookies!
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-10-28,5,"These are my favorite cookies. Period. They are the best cookies I've had in New York and I bring them with me as a treat when I go to visit my west coast work team. These are the one cookie that's worth waiting in line for (though with their multiple locations, they make it a bit faster). No, this bakery isn't in the heart of the village and near a bunch of touristy things, BUT it is absolutely worth the journey to the upper west side. Also, they freeze wonderfully, and last about three months, according to the person at the bakery who helped me. I, however, have never had one in my freezer long enough to test this theory out. ;)
Do yourself a favor and try this cookie ASAP."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-10-26,5,"I saw this place on my favorite YouTube show Worth It, wanted to teri it since I made it to NYC.
The cookies are awesome! Huge and moist tons of raisins. 
The coffee cake was huge too and yummy.
The coffee could have been a little hotter but was great flavor."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-10-25,2,"I been buying cookies from Levain has been many years, those chocolate chips cookies are my favorites But now they Made cookies are smaller then use to was. that's pretty disappointing because they charged you pretty much money for one cookie $4 So what is the reason they shrinking the cookies?"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-10-21,5,"So delicious! I always get the dark chocolate chocolate chip but only 1. Despite being great I can only have 1 and throughout the day, not at once, as they are quite rich. But nothing a hot cup of coffee can't solve :) 

Although their original location is nearby I would recommend stopping here if you'd like to avoid the line/crowd."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-10-19,4,"Levain Bakery has been on my NYC bucket list for about a month. After countless YouTube videos of the iconic Chocolate Walnut and blog reviews of the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, I finally got the chance to visit New York City again and experience these cookies for myself.

The line was quite a long wait. With some family members and friends, I waited for about 15 minutes. This is understandable due to how popular these cookies are. 

When I started my order, I wanted to get one of each cookie and the banana bread. Unfortunately, the banana bread was out of stock and I was actually pretty upset about it. I am a huge lover of banana bread, but I understand that the bakery does receive a lot of customers.

Here's my list of the cookies, from best to (I won't say worst) ""least best"":
1. The classic chocolate chip walnut. The most iconic one. With a perfect ratio of sweetness and walnut, this one really lived up to the hype surrounding it.
2. The oatmeal raisin cookie. Now, I know a lot of people don't like oatmeal raisin cookies, but I have always enjoyed them. Levain's take on oatmeal raisin was delicious. They also offer oatmeal raisin scones! On my list for next time...
3. The peanut butter dark chocolate cookie. I have trouble with desserts that are too sweet, as they give me headaches and nausea. Personally, I am a huge fan of peanut butter and nut butters, but the rest of the cookie was nauseatingly sweet in my opinion.
4. The dark chocolate chocolate chip cookie. This was even sweeter than the peanut butter dark chocolate chip. Also, the flavors inside were not as exciting as the chocolate chip walnut or the oatmeal raisin. However, it's a great option if you have strong sweet tooth.
(Keep in mind that none of these were actually ""bad"", they were all delicious with some just more delicious than others)

These cookies were also quite pricy. Each cookie was $4.00, and I expected them to be larger for their astounding price. They were thick, but the whole cookie was about the size of my palm. That was slightly disappointing and underwhelming because all the pictures I had seen of these cookies had made it appear much larger than it was.

Overall, I do believe this is a great bakery and I would come here again to try the banana bread and scone options. The chocolate walnut cookie was as good as I had expected, and I highly recommend it if you're in NYC. See you soon, Levain!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-10-17,5,Fantastic. Delicious. Friendly. Great environment. Easy to get to. One of the highlights of our trip.
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-10-11,5,"Excellent choice for coffee and baked goods. I stopped in for the first time yesterday and tried their iced americano. It was strong, but that's how coffee should be. If you like a true cup of coffee, come to Levain. I also tried their brioche, which I don't normally care for, but theirs looked so soft....and it was yummy! Warm, soft, fresh brioche. All of their other baked items looked delicious, so I will be back to try more."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-10-10,5,Worlds best cookie. Hands down. Will travel across the city just to get one. You should too!
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-10-09,5,"The cookies, need I say more? Levain has been on my bookmarks forever so when I accidentally stumbled upon it on the upper west side, I knew I hit the jackpot. 

Clean and open, Levain is the perfect nook to grab a cup of coffee and the worlds thickest cookie. An afternoon pick me up is all you need to get through your Monday. 

The coffee is hot and fresh. The workers are friendly. I can't complain."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-10-01,4,"Ok, so I've had cookies but not like this. And these are not your usual size cookies or dosage. They are thick in size with a gooey inside and a crispy outside, gives it a chewy texture. I've been hearing about this bakery for a while and have heard plenty of raves on it's goodness. I mean they are good but not the best thing I've ever had, and honestly one cookie could be way too much for some. I tried the Oatmeal Raisin & the Chocolate Chip with Walnut cookies. The oatmeal cookie is not like your usual cookie. It taste very good & it's very different, I think I even tasted coconut flakes. The chocolate chip cookie was good as well, the chocolate chips & walnut are a good balance. Really can't get enough of the gooey inside! This is my first time visiting and this location is huge compared to others. Friendly staff as well."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-09-29,4,This bakery has amaaazinggg cookies that are big and soft. I pop them in the oven for about 10 seconds get the chocolate chips nice and melted and it's the best possible midnight snack ever. I wasn't a huge fan of the brioche bun it was kinda just hard sugar bread but the cookies are definitely worth it. I usually like oatmeal raisin cookies but that didn't have chocolate chips in them also so it was a little disappointing but the regular chocolate chip cookies made up for it all. I tried one of each cookie and I gotta say the classic chocolate chip is lord of my snack kingdom!!
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-09-28,5,"BEST COOKIES I HAVE EVER HAD! There is a lot of hype surrounding the cookies at Levain Bakery and they were way better than I even imagined! These cookies are MASSIVE- no way I could finish them in one go. I'm telling you, they are super thick, filled with tons of chocolate chips. The inside is ooey gooey, just the perfect amount undercooked. I think they just took these cookies out of the oven because they were warm and smelled heavenly.

I tried the classic chocolate chip walnut cookie and dark chocolate peanut butter chip cookie. Could I possibly pick a favorite? Honestly no. Both cookies were amazing. I would have loved if they had a normal chocolate chip cookie, but the added walnut is still pretty good. The dark chocolate peanut butter chip is super peanut buttery and not too sweet because of the dark chocolate. At $4 a cookie, they are worth every penny!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-09-22,5,"The amazing cookie! $4 per cookie, 4 flavors only. A short walk from the original location with a much shorter line, and bigger retail space. The cookies are divine and lives up to the hype. Note that they are massive (thick). I got a drip coffee to go, and was miffed that the coffee was so hot I couldn't easily hold the cup. The lid of the cup was also not a great fit for the cup, and the coffee was easily too hot. Whatever, the cookie was a dream. The interior has only room for standing at a shelf, so don't expect to linger. Grab yourself your goods and head to the park to enjoy, which is what I did :) also recommend the bread with butter and jam. The bread had an interesting texture--almost like it had wheat in it? The butter in it was divine.

Oh and I looked up how to pronounce ""levain"" -- it's apparently ""lev-ehn"" but what do I know, not being a French speaker."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-09-16,5,"Seriously one of the best cookies ever, worth the hype! The other upper west side location had a line, so we headed to this one and had super quick service! Came back two times in one week it was so yummy! Tried both the classic chocolate chip walnut and the dark chocolate peanut butter, both delicious but the chocolate chip has a special place in my heart now!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-09-15,5,"This is the best cookie in the world!!! Everything at the bakery is baked to perfection in a very authentic way that doesn't need the frills that other shops need. Obviously, if you've never been before the cookies are the thing to try. All the flavors are very good, but the unexpected one is the oatmeal raisin (the only non-chocolate cookie) is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Other options  to try would be any of their sweet breads, the baguette with butter and jam, or their blueberry muffins. You know you're having a good day if you stop by Levain Bakery!!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-09-10,5,One of the best chocolate chip cookies to date ... my New York trip was made while after I ate these cookies... going back next month to indulge once more
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-09-10,5,Holy cow! THE standard for cookies everywhere!!!! What else can I write? They are Devine.
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-09-08,5,"I learned something yesterday. The famous Levain Bakery cookie, when taken off the hot rack it should be consumed within the hour. The hard exterior of the cookie and the steam that comes out when you break the cookie in half, the experience is lost when you stick them in a box and travel out of New York City.

Last weekend we're all having a discussion. My niece asked me: Uncle Bill, what is your favorite cookie? I said, Hands down Levain Bakery. Oprah is one of my followers and she agrees with me. My wife blurts out, that cookie is second place to the Chick-fil-a freshly baked cookie. 

Wait a second. 

I enjoy a Chick-fil-a cookie but when it comes to the best? My wife will have to experience Levain bakery again with my sister in law.

Saturday morning I walk into a beautiful new space. While I enjoyed the 74th st space with the flour bags stacked up against the walls, the new space is very modern. It has ropes for line control, no one is standing outside waiting. I ordered one of every flavor: Chocolate Peanut Butter Chip, Chocolate, Oatmeal raisin and Chocolate Chip walnut. I also ordered a cold brew and a slice of lemon cake to have inside the new space. The lemon cake made my soul cry on the inside. Pure perfection.

I drive back to the burbs with my baked goods. I show my sister in law the Levain bag, she's excited to try the Levain cookie. We open the box, all of the cookies are each wrapped in individual paper, it feels like Christmas morning. We each cut each cookie and judge which one is our favorite. My sister in laws family was leaning towards the peanut butter chip but my heart tells me Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chip. Not having the hometown field advantage, there is no steam coming out of the cookies.

We all agreed the Levain cookies rock. My wife? She's sticking with her choice. It's been a while since her last Levain hot & fresh off the rack cookie. I love the new space, we'll be back. I highly recommend coming to Levain bakery for their freshly made, hot off the rack cookies."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-09-07,4,"Huge crispy cookie that's gooey on the inside! 

Dark chocolate with peanut butter chips is the way to go."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-09-07,5,"I have actually had my eye on this spot for a while because I visit the city every so often and occasionally just want a good spot to grab a cuppa and a nibble in the morning instead of going full-bore for breakfast, and I'm glad to have finally made it inside [we'd been going to the other location, but it was crowded, so it's handy to have them around the corner from one another].

Every positive review here, every gooey video pull of the [to clarify for people who haven't been inside] scone-cookies is the epitome of what this bakery represents and I was thrilled to have the same sticky experience myself. Everything is ridiculously melt-in-your-mouth amazing, and I need to go back to the city so I can have another, and another, and another, and wash it down with one of their excellent cups of coffee.

I want to go back for lunch and try the pizza. I want another jammy bomboloncini, I want to take home loaves of bread and a tray of the sticky buns. I want them to be closer to my home. Maybe if they build a sixth location..."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-08-31,5,"Truly the best cookies we have ever tasted.  Huge, moist and delicious!  Try all of the different kinds -  you won't regret it!  The location we went to was small so there isn't seating but there is a bench outside where you can enjoy."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-08-30,3,"Tyler C. from The Bachelorette said that these were the best chocolate chip cookies he's ever had, so naturally I came here. Not only did I NOT see Tyler from the bachelor, but the cookies were just OK. The texture was nice because it was gooey inside and crisp on the outside, but they honestly weren't that good. At $4 a cookie and an endorsement from a bachelor contestant, I had higher hopes, y'all! I'd skip this place."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-08-28,5,"These cookies! My goodness! I take a train ride from NJ to get my hands on Levain's fat chocolate chip cookies. You will literally eat them like you're in a commercial.... you know, with your eyes closed as you take a bit and moan to the effect of all that flavor bursting in your mouth, then you slowly open your eyes to stare at your new found love. Yes that is me!! EVERY TIME. Hahaha. But seriously their cookies are amazing. Totally worth the trip for that big a** cookie! ;-)"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-08-16,5,"I love this location!!! It is so much faster than the other one and is clean and new and a much better experience. 

I got the double chocolate chip cookie and the lemon sweet cake for later and both were good! The double chocolate chip is by far the best cookie in my opinion. It's extremely gooey and rich which is really everything I want out of my cookies.

The lemon cake slice was closer to average/bordered on dry. I got the end piece so maybe the middle pieces are better.

Overall, totally worth the hype but make sure you come to this location instead of waiting in line at the other one!!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-08-16,5,"Soft, gooey, loaded with chocolate chips and huge! What else could be better? Oh yeah, the cappuccino is amazing as well. I think they add a little chocolate to it, as it has a very smooth chocolatey flavor. I could come here every day!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-08-11,5,"It is absolutely not hyperbole to say that this is absolutely the BEST chocolate chip cookie in NYC. Crispy on the outside, soft and gooey with chocolate on the inside; not too sweet, and the extra crunch from the walnuts complete this perfectly sized cookie.

It probably helps that there is a consistent line out the door at all hours so that any cookie you get is basically fresh out the oven."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-08-11,5,Easily the best cookies I've ever had. This place is a must visit if you're in the city. The wait was a bit long (maybe 25mins on a Saturday late afternoon) but absolutely worth it
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-08-11,5,Loved the massive chocolate chip walnut cookie! Crunchy on the outside but melty chocolate goodness on the inside
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-08-07,5,"This place is extremely popular so I had to see what the hype was all about. lol I have to say is THE HYPE IS REAL. These monstrous cookies are like the size of a sandwich. But they are chewy, gooey, and oh so delicious! I ordered the variety pack and my favorite was the chocolate cookie with peanut butter chips. The variety pack survived a flight back to LA and my boyfriend and friends loved them. We stored them per the instructions and they were still just as delicious a few days later."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-08-04,5,"Best. Chocolate Chip Cookie. Ever. *mic dropped*
She's thicc and doughy inside. Okay, eww, but seriously best cookie I've ever had in my 27 years. The chocolate chip with walnuts is delicious too. If you're ever in NYC, you have to stop here. You won't regret it!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-08-02,5,"Yum! Big gooey and oh so big!! I usually nibble on the cookies for a long time or share with a couple people because they are huge! One of the tips the server suggested to me was to cling wrap the cookies and they should last one week and you can even toss them in the freezer to last even longer. And it seems to work so I am glad that I can have them around for longer! The cookies are absolutely delish (my favorite is the dark chocolate chip cookie) and definitely worth a try! 

Tip: I would go to the Upper East side location in mid afternoon because it seems to be less crowded than other locations."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-07-30,4,"Is definitely one of the best cookies I ever tried.  
They also sell banana bread,  pizzas to go,  homemade bread loaf. 
On the weekends gets so crowded you have to do a big line....  
Is a cookie place but is only 4 types and that's rbe reason why I Gave  them 4 stars

Totally worth to try.  
Very caloric alert."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-07-30,5,"I LOVE LEVAIN COOKIES! Honestly there is nothing better than a fresh cookie from there. The past few months I've been given cookies as gifts and I finally got the chance to visit a bakery while in the city. These cookies are super thick and easily weigh a quarter pound and are jammed pack with chips. One cookie is more than enough to even split as it is so rich and sweet. I visited the location on Amsterdam and was a bit disappointed that they didn't have plain chocolate chip cookies in stock, but the double chocolate chip with peanut butter chips was worth every bite. Currently have a few cookies in my freezer for when the craving hits  wish they'd open a location on Long Island!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-07-28,5,The chocolate chip walnut is not a favorite for no reason !!! Best cookies ever hands down. The oatmeal and dark chocolate are pretty awesome as well. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to some of these cookies.
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-07-25,5,"These are literally the best oversized cookies in NYC. I love the store on 74th because it's so close to the train stop and it's convenient and accessible if I'm in the area and have a sweet craving. Although it's not the roomiest of stores the staff is always kind and courteous and try to get people in and out as fast as possible. My ABSOLUTE favorite thing to get at Levain are definitely the Oatmeal Raisin Scones.... THATS RIGHT, THE SCONES! And I pride myself of being a COOKIE MONSTER, because I looove all cookies but their scones are THAT GOOD! They have just the right amount of sweet and savory with the golden raisins and flaky texture perfect for breakfast or if you have a craving for both savory with a little sweet touch. And if cookies aren't your thing these are the best thing ever. 
1. As far as cookies, you can never go wrong with the classic Chocolate Chip Walnut cookies in this place if you love CCC's you'll fall in love.  
2. The oatmeal raising cookies here are the Bee's Knees and I must admit I am partial to these at Levain because the chocolate walnut can sometimes get too overwhelming depending on the day/mood. So oatmeal raisin are my definitely FAVORITE @ Levain. 
3. I tried the Chocolate and  Peanut-butter cookies and I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would... TOO Decadent to the point where you think YOUR HEAD IS GOING TO EXPLODE!!! Like it's too much chocolate peanutbutterryyy where you think your tastebuds are slowly exploding/orgasming but my tastebuds can't take it they're too weak and flimsy, but if your tastebuds are though and like the feeling of helplessness because the cookie is JUST THAT ORGASMIC, than go for it!! ***Mind Blown!***"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-07-24,3,Over hyped walnut cookies. I think chip is honestly better. The customer service here is okay.
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-07-22,4,"Maybe not the best cookie in the world, but it's pretty good. I was hesitant on trying the chocolate peanut butter one but the girl who worked there recommended it to me. Overall I liked it more than the best seller which was the chocolate chip walnut cookie."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-07-22,5,"Read and heard so much about this bakery and their cookies that I knew I had to try it when I was in NY. Got the chocolate chip walnut cookie. Its reputation as being the best cookie in NYC is well deserved. It is hefty, like a big paperweight. It has a decent crunch on the outside and is moist and soft on the inside. It is absolutely delicious. I would normally say $4 for a cookie is over-priced, but it is NYC and prices in general are higher than average."
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-07-20,5,"No line, zero wait at 11:30am on a Saturday. Ordered a chocolate chip walnut cookie. The size is perfect to share or indulge solo. The chocolate chips are melted but the cookies itself manages to keep its shape and not crumble. Great!"
235,levain-bakery-new-york-5,2019-07-18,5,"I was super excited to try this place out and went with high expectations.

There was a line but it moved fairly quickly and we were able to order within 10 minutes of being there. I was prepared to be disappointed because it had been so hyped up but...

Hands down the best cookie I've ever had.

The chocolate chip walnut was AMAZING. You can barely  taste the walnut in my opinion so it's mostly just a chocolate chip cookie. 

The chocolate peanut butter was a little heavier but I love peanut butter so the powerful peanut butter taste didn't bother me. 

The inside was soft and a bit undercooked, with a warm, hard, and crunchy outside. 

It is very dense and a lot but I would still go for a cookie per person and eat it slowly or save it for later because this is a one time experience."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2020-07-04,4,"Really good spot for a casual meet-up with friends or a quick bite to satisfy that sweet tooth. Their cream puffs are what they're best known for, and I think that anyone can find a variety of cream puff served here that they find delicious. The mini puffs are fun, as are the seasonal flavors. However, my absolute favorite thing to order here is the MOCHI. So so so good. The best mochi I have ever had. My favorite flavors are strawberry and passion fruit, but most are delicious. Good texture of the coating (without a weird after taste), good ice cream on the inside, just the right amount of frozen. You also avoid the weird powder on some supermarket mochis. Love. Lastly, the service is always efficient and I have no complaints on the staff."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2020-03-05,5,So delicious. I just can't describe. Amazingly fresh and texture profile can't be beat. The flavors are all so good. Best cream puffs I ever had by far!
236,beard-papas-new-york,2020-02-08,1,I was pretty appalled by the customer service here. The two employees behind the counter seemed like they hated life and truly could not have been less friendly or courteous. They were openly complaining about their jobs and swearing while we sat and ate. Then someone who seemed like a manager came out and was equally unpleasant. Are these really the best employees they can find? I won't be back.
236,beard-papas-new-york,2020-01-20,1,"GOOD BYE MY DEAR FRIEND, GOOD BYE.

This is what I call a good franchise gone wrong in the hands of the wrong, uninterested manager/owner. The place was unorganized, missing menu items early in the day. Kitchen was dirty and kitchen supplies all over the place and on the floor. This is the first time I questioned myself if eating whatever was in that puffs were...""safe"". Cashier took my order punched in the order took my credit card and with that same glove started touching the puffs and filling it up. I was appalled (no he didn't), yes, he did. They've been creeping the price of these now almost half the size they used to be and half the custard. My puffs came out to $25 bucks for 6, small puffs with half the filling. No, thank you. 

I remember going to one of my favorite dessert spot in Upper West on a Sunday afternoon. That was 10 years ago, yes I've been coming here about 10 years. When it first opened it was operated in a small back kitchen from two very polite Japanese ladies, place was clean, tidy and the smell of fresh puffs coming out of the oven were absolutely delightful. They didn't have too much items on the menu but the puffs were simply amazing. Paying over $20 bucks for 6 puffs were hard to swallow even back then. But, I was sure I have found a little piece of haven on Upper West. That place is gone now and I will never return to that odd place of cold, hard puffs that are held captive with mysterious custard filling.

236,beard-papas-new-york,2020-01-20,1,The guy with dreads is so rude yesterday and the  other day girl with blonde hair and glasses snatched my money.  Customer service needs to be better !!!!! Good puffs
236,beard-papas-new-york,2020-01-17,3,"Beard Papa's makes some of the city's best cream puffs. The puff is light and fluffy and the cream is extremely airy and pleasant to eat. However, this review is for the UWS location on 77th and Broadway.

Compared to the other Beard Papa location in Midtown, the UWS' location produces cream puffs that are noticeably smaller than the puffs that they used to make. Over the past year, the size of the puff has decreased by 20-30% and they seem to be over-baked, where the softer inside ends up crisping up, resulting in a fairly hard cream puff.

If you're looking to get a good Beard Papa experience, definitely avoid the UWS location. Not only are the prices higher, but the quality of the puff has declined."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2020-01-07,2,"The cream puff was AMAZING - just as good as I remembered

The rest of the experience, however...

I like reggaeton as much as the next person, but I didn't particularly enjoy it blasting away at 11am on Saturday in a cute pastry shop. Maybe a dominican bakery could get away with it. Maybe

Can't remember the last time I had a coffee that bad. Hospital waiting room bad. Lukewarm, watery, not to mention there were zero non-dairy alternatives (almond, soy milk, etc)

Unfortunately the mini puffs were only sold in sets of a half dozen or more. 

 My date and I were the only people there. We ordered 2 original cream puffs and a coffee. We got the coffee. Sat down. Waited. Waited. Waited. The two staff members chatted away while we sat just a few feet from them at an empty table. After a number of minutes my date had to get up, take two steps over, and remind them that we, the only customers there, had in fact ordered something. 

I know its a bakery, but maybe they need to lay off the wake-n-bake"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-12-24,1,"I've been regular customer since they opened many years ago.
after renovations, changing management, its' getting worse worse every year....
cream puff quality went down from 100% to bellow 5o% or less..
Staff worker seems doesn't care about anything about CREAMPUFF

cream  flavor, textures, most importantly the kids workers doesn't know how to fill up the puff, 
cream is about half of volume than used to be, same price or cost more now.
puff is too dry....
sadly this is how most business fell...
losing quality control especially FOODS industry... 

You can get better cream puff may be cheaper from somewhere else."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-12-18,5,"Best. Cream puffs. Ever.

I'm not quite sure why Beard Papa's isn't more popular than it is. The cream puffs are always fresh and contain the right amount of sweetness. They directly insert the cream when ordered, which prevents it from becoming soggy. 

There are new flavors to try, which is also very enticing!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-10-11,1,"I went there after a while. These day, the taste, nothing is special. The service is getting worse. No smile."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-10-08,1,"I honestly don't know what happened to this place but it has made it to the D listed cream puff spots. It used to be so good!!!! But now the puffs are like cardboard with burnt taste. Very sad!!!And what I don't get is, lately the place carry empty pastryglass desplays. They have to make the puffs and one has to wait. Some of the young men who work there are polite but there is a man who is on the rude side, has a strong voice and I was able to hear him mumbling about me behind the register and talking obnoxiously to the other young man who was working with him that night. In his mind, he thought he was training him. This place used to be top notch...what happened??!!

Telling customers every time ""we don't have the honey & butter but I can make it for you in 8 minutes"", not a good business strategy  and customer service. 

Man!!!when I think about how awesome it used to be and when I see where it is now

Someone rescue the place."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-09-22,5,The best cream puffs you'll ever have!! Try it once and you'll never forget the taste!
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-09-17,2,"Going to a Beard Papa's had always been a treat - I would often get one when I visited the West coast. I had been to this one on the UWS side before and it was decent, but it has recently took a tumble down to a grade on par with a Dunkin Donuts. Tragic.

First, upon walking into this small space I noticed a number of small fans on the floor blowing away. A curious sight amongst a nearly empty display of puffs. Granted, it was late in the evening and the store was closing in 30, but the lack of selection was disappointing. We ordered the regular puff and their salted honey puff and somehow our order was forgotten. There was one other customer. They eventually got to our order when they noticed we were standing there, with puzzled looks on our faces. We tried enjoying our puffs on our way to the movies but the regular was stale, almost cardboard-like. The salted honey was much better. Needless to say we won't be coming back. For real cream puffs head to a place like Bibble and Sip."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-09-09,4,"They do make a great cream puff. However, I do wish they weren't so messy. I had the cookies & cream flavor, which was a lot. Next time I would go back for a simpler version and to maybe try one of the custard drinks. Staff was super nice, but did not tell me about a promotion that was going on at the time, even though they mentioned it to other customers."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-08-23,4,"Not much to say, very greasy and delicate pastry. I purchased the original and it's not sweet just very lite and airy, next time I will try other varieties."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-08-11,5,Delicious food and very friendly staff. The name is a little weird but everything else is fine!
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-07-30,5,"After going to one of their locations in Korea, was surprised to see that they had an outpost in this random part of the UWS. Bright interior with limited seating and a display behind the counter for what's available.

While the menu is small, the pricing is solid. Ordered the Mocha Cream Custard drink ($3.50) and a Honey Butter Puff ($3.50). Didn't realize until after that any Custard comes with a free Original Puff. So here I am with two puff pastries and a thick custard drink. Naturally I eat it all - amazing flaky crusts and sweet interior. The puffs are surprisingly light, though that was countered by the heavy mocha drink. A little messy to eat, so make sure to grab a bunch of tissues.

Service is quick and the place mostly has people do take out orders, meaning seats are usually available. Not something I'll crave often, but a great dessert spot."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-07-26,5,"Whoa! Instagram upperfeast. Great pastries. I had the strawberry with chocolate filling, green tea w green tea filling, and Oreo with vanilla filling. Also the staff is really nice."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-07-10,1,"Used to love them. 2nd time it's a disappointment. Not as it used to be: appears twice smaller, twice more expensive and green tea cream puffs that we had were not tasty at all."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-07-03,3,I love their cream puffs but their employees could use extra training. I'm not sure what type of onboarding process they go through but it's been pretty unpleasant every time I visit any of their locations. I love their cream puffs though!
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-06-16,5,"On my quest for the best cream puffs, this one made it to the top of my list so far.
I've been looking for something with a thick, crunchy shell filled with light, creamy filling.
Although I wish the filling and the coating to have been less sweeter, the scrumptious shell with its voluminous crunchy texture blew me away. 
Not to say that these cream puffs are reasonably priced in this area ($3.20~$3.60 depending on flavor and filling)"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-06-08,5,"This location is out of my way so I usually make a stop here whenever I am on the UWS.  I have only tried the original cream puff at Beard Papa and that is really the only one I need.  I have not ordered the other flavors, like green tea, because there is frosting on the outside of the cream puff and I believe it might be too sweet for me.  I might give the green tea or even the creme brulee flavor a try eventually.  It just seems that every time I visit Beard Papa, I stick to the original because I know it is consistent and satisfies me every time.  The aroma and the taste are just unbelievable.  The puff pastry is crispy and the vanilla cream is light.  I have bought a dozen of these cream puffs for a family gathering and they were just devoured.  I miss the location they used to have years ago on Astor Place.  I hope this gains in popularity and they open more stores.  Hands down, the best cream puff I have ever tried."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-05-10,4,"This place was cute and small. Wish it was a tiny bit bigger but luckily there is only one other person there when I went. This is my first time trying cream puffs, they were really good. I was half expecting the cream to be super sweet and overbearing but it's not which balances it out. The lady working there was really nice and the environment was neat and clean. I think only about six people can be in there before it gets crowded."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-05-01,5,A pretty fun concept and the person behind the counter was helpful and kind. Will definitely be visiting again soon!
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-04-27,4,"I was a little disappointed at the fact that they only have two flavors of the small cream puffs. So I tried the big ones instead; I really liked the honey butter, the green tea with green tea filling, the almond and the chocolate ones. They have a special where you buy 5 and you get one free. The girl was very nice and helpful with the order as it was my first time here. I will be coming back for the chocolate lava cake and the cream puffs I liked. Oh, and they make their own paste for the hot chocolate which was yummy as well."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-04-09,1,"The Asian girl (Aya was a name identified on my receipt) who closed today at 9 PM (Friday) March 22, was so spacey and frankly, should not be in the service industry.  She firstly got our order wrong and put six various cream puffs into the system.  We only ordered four cream puffs.  It got to a point where we became bottlenecks in the queue and she held back 4-5 people behind us because she just wouldn't listen.  Then, it got to a point where I accepted whichever four she ended up logging in the system just to make her go away.  She just could not get it right.  

She was impatient and continued to rush our order.  She asked me to return to the counter at least four times because she was so slow that someone would buy the last flavor of whichever one I selected.  She then offered me items that were less expensive than I actually paid for!  Finally, I was fed up and just told her to pick whatever she wanted because replacing one cream puff that as sold out was taking her 4-6 tries!  

So at the end of the day, at least two of the cream puffs were ones I didn't even want!  She ruined this experience for me.  Each time, I would choose a new cream puff, ie the cookies and cream flavor, then she would run off and someone would buy it.  Then she would come back and say whoops, sorry sold out!  THE WORST AND SLOWEST SALES PERS

Then, since my remaining options were all less expensive than what I paid for, I asked if she could provide a small mini cream puff to make up for the difference or just for the sake of RUINING my experience.  She said ""NO,"" but you can order yourself a cheesecake or something for the same cost.  Girl, I did not come in here for a cheesecake.  Learn some manners, or give the customer something small for being so incompetent!  This was COMPLETELY your fault!  You should be giving the customer something -- ANYTHING for being such a terrible service agent!  

Then, we make it to 8:50 after her several failed attempts at getting us four cream puffs we ordered.  Our friends arrived only to receive items they did not order.  She then proceeded to kick us out of the bakery for closing, but she had wasted our time to begin with.  We barely had time to eat before she scurried us out!

Beard Papa, you used to be one of my favorite cream puff establishments.  This girl was rude and could not understand basic instructions.  Though my criticism may be harsh, I am speaking the truth and she has already lost customers for you.  I will go ahead and inform EVERYONE to not come by because of such service.  Farewell, I'll find another place.  Aya, if that's your name, you're just awful - and don't think that I did not see you giggling in the back because you messed up our orders.  

I provided a copy of the receipt for the manager to look at.  My boyfriend was nicer to her, but I will not let this go unpunished.  

Update** owners were supposed to contact me and never did-  The service continues to be just as bad!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-04-06,5,"I LOVE this place. Last time I came here, I got the cookies and cream puff and it was delicious. This time I got the honey and butter and it was just as delicious. The feeling is generous and they taste wonderfully fresh. One of my favorite desserts in the city!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-03-28,4,"I got the green tea cream puff and chocolate lava cake (they called it differently). The cream puff was crispy and big , which made it hard to eat without making a mess. It's ok. 

However, the chocolate lava cake was very good after microwaving it. The lava was smooth and the cake's taste was well balanced, not too sweet. Such a good treat."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-03-13,3,I should've gone for a cream puff but I'm usually not a fan. The hot chocolate was terrible. I expected the chocolate lava cake to actually have melted chocolate (there was a drop). It was also pretty tasteless. Guess I'll try a puff next time.
236,beard-papas-new-york,2019-01-26,5,"Amazing as ever. To start with, you can't hardly find cream puffs. If you do they don't have this superior filling and light outside. These are hard to find in the U.S. but when in NYC this is a must. Love the original. They have green tea filling, mini puffs, chocolate covered. I'll stay with the vanilla. Clean and orderly. Great staff. Love these."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-12-28,5,"Found out about this place through Yelp and when I saw it in person, I had to try it. The store is very small and only has seating for about 8 people so we took ours to go. We ordered the original cream puff with chocolate filling and a chocolate eclair with vanilla filling. Both cream puff were very good and tasted fresh. We preferred the chocolate eclair with the vanilla filling because we love chocolate & it had more flavor than the cream puff. We do not eat cream puffs/eclair frequently so we don't have a lot to compare it to, but we enjoyed it and thought they tasted good!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-12-19,5,My husband brought home cream puffs and they were so good. I though the pictures looked like too much filling but the filling is so good.
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-12-16,5,"Whenever I'm craving cream puffs or mochi ice cream, Beard Papa's is my go-to place! Cute place not a lot of seats but tasty puffs and mochi! Definitely give them a try!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-12-10,5,"First time to try their Matcha Cream Puff!!! Since it was my first time, I was hoping to get some Help from the staff but he wasn't that friendly. But It's ok! I just chose the original shell to go with the matcha filling. It never disappointed. So good that I finished two pcs. Just what I needed after my dental appointment. It was a different experience for me."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-11-24,3,"Pretty good cream puff. We tried a couple of different types. The one I personally had was the eclair with chocolate cream. It is a small, pretty clean spot-it can be easy to miss if you are not looking for it. The staff member assisting us was very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the cream puff, especially the cream part of it; however, I feel that I have had better cream puffs. However, cream puffs can be difficult to find in the city; so this place is perfect if you are in the mood for a cream puff uptown. It's a place that I would return to if I am in the mood specifically for a cream puff, but if I'm in the mood for a filling dessert I would go elsewhere."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-11-19,5,"I can remember all 4 instances I had gotten to delight in Beard Papa cream puffs because they are THAT good. It's hands down one of my favorite desserts next to Lady M's crepe cakes and Jeni's ice cream. The cream filling is the perfect amount of sweetness and density...heavier than whipped cream but lighter than icing. The shell is extremely light and flavored to compliment the filling, not too sweet. A beard papa cream puff is like the opposite of a cannoli in that way. I can easily eat 3 in a sitting.....

get some to take home with you to share with friends and family; they will love you forever!!!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-11-14,5,This is one of my absolute  favorite places to come when I get to the city....Always fresh. I wish one would come out to the Island.
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-08-17,2,"I had always been a big fan of Beard Papa's cream puffs before they closed down all but one location in Manhattan. Today I walked many blocks in the heat to get a cream puff...but I was disappointed by the quality of the cream puff I received. The custard inside was so runny that while I was eating the cream puff, it oozed out and got all over my shirt. I never had any Beard Papa cream puff that was so runny like this. Over the years not only did the price increase drastically, the size of the puff also decreased, and now the quality of the custard suffered as well. I have tried Beard Papa cream puffs in Japan and Taiwan before, and the cream puffs were of much higher quality. I regret to share that this location will no longer be my favorite cream puff store...I will have to wait until I visit Japan or Taiwan to get an authentic Beard Papa's cream puff. :("
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-08-09,5,"Must visit!! best cream puffs and now they serve little ones as well, so you can try all the flavors!!
thank you for delicious treats!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-08-05,5,"YES, this is the WORLD'S BEST CREAM PUFF!!!! You need to add this place to your bucket list if you love sweet delicious desserts!!!  

Be prepared to have powdered sugar and custard cream all over your happy face!!! It's life changing compared to other cream puffs!!! Others fail by comparison!!!!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-07-25,3,"Got a chocolate puff with vanilla cream, as well as a green tea puff with chocolate cream. The cream is simply delectable. Such smooth texture and perfect amount of sweetness. Unfortunately, The puff shell for me was kind of tough and oddly stale. Shame, I feel like it would have been so awesome if it was super fresh! I did come around 8 PM..."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-07-05,3,"Went here 2 days ago after a long hiatus. Sad to see a B rating in the window! I used to love this place. It's really changed quite a bit and not for the better. Seems more commercial now than the quaint little neighborhood spot I remember. Plus, that B rating turned me off.  However,  I decided to order a chocolate and a vanilla creme puff anyway. Both were good, but I don't think I'll return anytime soon."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-07-03,4,"I went to my first Beard Papa's in L.A. and it left a positive impression on me. So I was excited when I realized there was one in NYC.

The one I went to had lots of desserts available. This location seems to specialize in cream puffs, which is fine because who doesn't like a cream puff?

There are many different shells (flavors) to choose from, and they all have the same cream filling. I personally stick with regular cream puffs, but I have tried most of the menu. For the price, I expected richer filling and taste. Every time I eat here I feel physically full, but I'm always wanting more flavor.

Occasionally they will have a promotion where you buy several and get one free. And if you sign up for their rewards program you can get discounted purchases for the future. This makes the prices seem for reasonable.

If you like cream puffs, you simply must have one of Bouchon Bakery's $5 cream puff at Rockefeller Center.

But if you're at Beard Papa's, try a cream puff or three."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-06-29,4,"It's a really small store but beautiful, clean, and organized.  The wall to the right has a brief story about how the store came about.

The cream puffs come in different flavors and shapes, and you also have the option of selecting different flavors for some of them, flavors such as vanilla, green tea, caramel.

The creme brûlée cream puff is on the more expensive side of close to $4 as opposed to other selections in the $3 range, but it was very tasty and a great mix of creme brûlée softness with the hard shell and cream filling.  

They also have mini cream puffs which are much smaller but also less expensive.

They have an option of pick 6 for a discount.  They also have a small kiosk that lets you set up a rewards account by putting in your phone number.  The first reward let's you get a free cream puff with any purchase on your second visit.  

I asked the cashier if I can buy a cream puff, step out of the store, come back in, buy another, and then get a free one but he said he believes there's a 24 hour limit to the rewards system!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-06-18,5,"I've been coming here since I've first started yelping, years ago when they had another outpost further downtown. This is the last renaming Beard Papa in Manhattan. It's been a long, long time but I am sure to treat myself to Beard papas once every year and a half or so. 

BLACK SESAME AND GREEN TEA ARE THE BEST CREAM PUFFS. 

Catching them on a day that they are serving black sesame is more rare than a celebrity behaving on Twitter. So when the specials are not available, original is best. I've had the other pastries served but they don't have the same sort of magic that the cream puffs do. They are light, crispy and filled to order just for you. 

These are totally worth cheating on a diet for."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-06-15,5,"Mmm, I loved cream puffs since I've first had a bite as a young child from a local Queens bakery (Canaan bakery), but it's always been difficult to find delicious tasting ones in the city. 

Enter Beard Papa's! I always beg my fiancee to bring some home when she's in the area, but this was my first personal visit. It's not the same cream puffs I grew up with, which are soft and delicate bite-sized wonders, but these are fantastic on another level.

The pie-crusted cream puff shell is tasty on its own and the choice of frostings are a great touch. Then you can choose from different filings! 

On my visit, I ordered 6 large cream puffs:
- two creme brulee puffs (new), which were open-faced vanilla puffs with that great crystallized caramel on top
- S'mores puff (also new), which is their chocolate cream puff and vanilla filling, with a toasted marshmallow on top. Almost a perfect marriage of s'mores and cream puff, but they should've used chocolate filling and maybe stuck in a tiny thin piece of graham cracker for flair
- green tea with green tea filling, which are sweet and still light, without much bitterness
- a chocolate puff with caramel filling
- a classic vanilla cream puff

Don't forget to sign up for rewards if you plan to frequent the chain! I got an extra free puff on this visit"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-06-03,3,I wanted a  green tea cream puff but unfortunately that's a seasonal offering and not back until August.  So I tried a green tea eclair with vanilla cream instead.  I though it was quite small and the green tea flavor is a bit sweet .  The vanilla cream was also too sweet and it wasn't that great.  I heard good things about the green tea cream so I may come back to try it in the summer or just stick with B&S which has it all the time.
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-05-19,5,"Beard Papa's should give us free cream puffs for all the advertising we do for them.  They're amazing and we feel a need to share them with the world (we're generous people like that).  Our favourite is the chocolate eclair puff with vanilla cream filling.  We really liked the croquant but they recently stopped making it.  We're hoping they'll bring it back though, so we keep asking them about it (we're annoying people like that).  Also - a pro-tip for eating without getting cream everywhere - eat the eclair with the chocolate side down.  I don't know why it works or how husband discovered this - but it works!  And after Beard Papa's you can get a mini roll or (read: and) pastry and coffee at Maison Kayser... and then a macaroon at Mille-feuille Bakery... (we're fat people like that)."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-05-02,1,"Closes at 9??? You might try telling them that. Walked in at 8.34, chairs are up and with the exception of the macaroons everything in the case had already been taken out. Think I'll go elsewhere."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-04-28,5,"Love the cream puffs at thus place. They really do give Bibble and Sip a run for their money! I came in right before closing on a week night, and I had to wait a bit even though there was nobody in front of me - but the wait was worth it. I've been to the Flushing location, and this one is just as good, if not better. The light, yet creamy, filling perfectly makes a post dinner dessert option (or a stop on your dessert crawl). Not too sweet, but almost too delicious to pass up! Highly recommended"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-04-27,4,"Love this place. Still great after I first tried them years ago. Service is so polite and efficient, and the kind woman wore fresh gloves for one small order of 1 plain mini cream puff. Reasonably priced. Adorable cafe!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-04-26,5,Delicious little cream puffs and eclairs. The seasonal flavors are fun. They did green tea matcha for st. Patrick's day! They have a few tables and chairs but it's a pretty tiny place so you're better off getting it to go.  Central Park is only a few blocks away so that's where I went with my cream puffs.
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-04-24,5,"Where did he others go?  This one is the one left standing and thank goodness it's still around.  Love the cream puffs with the perfect crunch, sweetness and creaminess"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-04-18,5,"It's a dangerous place. As i walk by here every morning I step into this cloud of warm, sweet, and buttery aroma that traps me and drags me in. The cream puffs are consistently good, but they are constantly striving for new creations. I absolutely LOVED the cake collection they did in February, including the creme brulee and the tiramisu. The matcha flavors for St Patty's day should just be made permanent. Also try the fondant (lava cakes). I tried them cold the first time and were not impressed, but on a later visit the cashier told me to microwave before eating and they were soooooo amazing."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-03-17,5,"When I first tasted these cream puffs, I had never tasted anything like this before. The pastry was amazingly crunchy on the outside and the inside gave way to the most amazing and Sumptuous custard that I have ever tasted. There was another spot over by the UN with the same concept but beard Papa's is still King."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-03-01,4,"Not bad, very interesting flavors. I think I'm just not a cream puff person. I really liked the filling .. not too much a fan of the puff. Maybe my bites were too big but the cream kept oozing out all over and for me that is the best part which I kept losing. At least the puff, which for the most part was a nice texture, chewy with a crisp exterior , served as an effective scoop to pick up the spilled cream. They're really generous with the cream, buttery with just the right amount of sweetness"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-02-16,5,"Such delicious desserts. I love the ever increasing choices! Always pleasant staff, not a long wait and fairly priced. Beard Papa doesn't disappoint. Definitely give it a try, it may just become your fav!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-02-16,5,"I've never had a cream puff - don't judge. I don't know how I've never managed to come across this delicious pastry, but when looking for a mid-morning snack in the neighborhood, my friend found Beard Papa's. The rave reviews do not lie! 

There is nothing super fancy about this place. It's a small, clean little store front with different flavors of creams and coatings. I believe they had the original, green tea, and chocolate cream fillings the day we popped in. In addition to fillings you can choose from a variety of shell coatings, including new ""fancy"" ones, like Tiramasu and Crème-Brulee (they looked TO DIE for!) 

I personally chose the honey butter coating and OG cream. It was honestly unlike any pastry I've ever had. Crunchy, sweet caramelized honey exterior surrounding a soft and flaky interior, and filled with silky fresh creamy custard. Not too sweet, not too thick - just the perfect compliment of flavors and textures. Had I no self control, I could have easily devoured more than one. 

The staff was lovely and accommodating, and you can see the entire operation from the counter as they worked to pump out pastries. Our cashier/ cream-puff master was clearly very happy to be at work and was super patient as we made our selections. Good service always makes a great difference. While I didn't order a beverage, a local New Yorker came into the shop with his friends while we ate our cream puffs and told his friend that Beard Papa's has the thickest, richest Hot Cocoa. The local man, clearly a longtime fan of Beard Papa's, talked his guests into ordering a large quantity of cream puffs with a variety of toppings and fillings. The counter man did warn, however, that the cream puffs really only stay fresh for about 24 hours, and should be stored in a refrigerator until they are eaten.

I'm dreaming about this place. I could swim in that cream puff filling. Definitely check it out!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-02-09,5,"This is the world standard for cream puffs.   A decade ago, I worked in Silicon Valley, and made frequent trips to Japan, where I first encountered Beard Papa.  Eventually, I had another job, and thought I'd never see these delicious items again, until one day my lovely wife brought home a Beard Papa cream puff she picked up on the way home from her job in San Francisco.  ""Where did you get this?  Are they still open?  No?  Let's drive there immediately, they might be open!""  Anyway, the next day I went to SF and got Beard Papa again.  When we moved to New York (I looked up to see if NY had a Beard Papa before buying the house), we went there.  The point I'm trying to make is the cream puffs really are that good.  The fill them on the spot, and in addition to the classic vanilla, there are several other flavors, including a rotating selection."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-02-06,5,So darn delicious. The honey butter with vanilla was just amaze balls. I also enjoyed the original with chocolate filling. One question...do you deliver?!?! I'm obsessed!
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-02-03,4,These are by far the best cream puffs that I have ever eaten and not only are they heaven in your mouth this place has a real old world vibe. They fill the pastries with fresh cream right in front of you and then box them. It is charming and absolutely delectable. My only complaint is that they don't keep longer hours and are often closed when I want to go pick up a box for a treat or a party gift. This is the best pastry shop in all of Manhattan as far as I am concerned!
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-01-26,5,I happened to be in the neighborhood and stopped in for a midday treat.  The honey butter puff with strawberry filling was absolutely delicious.   I could eat 5 of these!
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-01-21,3,"I came here the other night when i was craving cream puffs. Beard papas was one of my favorite places to grab cream puffs and it's sad that this is the last standing location in manhattan. The cream puffs are very good and i enjoyed them a lot. I didn't give them 4-5 stars because the place has a very sterile smell and the menu is very limited compared to other locations that used to be around. Basically your only fill choices are vanilla, chocolate, and flavor of the month.  As for the shell, it's pretty much just original, dulce de leche, honey butter, and eclair. The original and honey butter are my favorite. The eclair is ok but wish they'd use milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate as the bitterness doesn't clash well (in my opinion) with the fillings."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-01-16,5,"I have loved Beard Papas since its opening. The cream puffs always taste very fresh, light, and do not leave a waxy aftertaste. There is very little sitting space now, however, most customers do not linger. My parents inhale the cream puffs every time  I bring them home even though my mom dislikes most sweets. I recently had the pleasure of having the strawberry puff and it was light and had actual strawberry chunks. Their mochi ice cream is also pretty tasty and the employees are super nice every time i visit. This is a great place to go if you like lightly sweet desserts that leave you craving for more."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2018-01-09,5,"OMG! One of the best cream puffs I've ever had. They were all consistent with the crunch of the shell. Custard was not too sweet and tasted all natural. 
Only thing I can say is the inconvenience of the location size. There are literally 3 tiny round tables so it's not necessarily a social spot. Also not so wheelchair or stroller accommodating."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-12-29,4,"Cream puffs are similar to eclair but with a lighter custard and a fluffier shell. This place has authentic cream puffs, just like what I had in China. The rotating system also works similar. Different flavors of custard fillings and shells every week. But they always have original shell and vanilla custard. Interior was big enough for friends to hangout."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-12-28,5,"Before Bibble & Sip, there was Beard Papa's. They are the OG cream puffs purveyor. I love any cream-filled pastries and it was Beard Papa's that probably got me on that bandwagon eons ago. This is the last location in Manhattan that still carries these Japanese pastry gems, and it's unfortunate I don't find myself up there all that often.

The ones here are larger than other cream puffs, with a crunchy exterior and soft eggy interior. The cream filling is yum, with a perfect amount in each puff (read: a lot). I prefer the original, but their green tea is also a nice flavor, usually sold out, as is the chocolate hazelnut one. I hope this location stays open for a long time coming."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-12-06,5,"My friend picked some of these babies up for me. Brought em to work on a Thursday morning. Now, work is no fun and Thursday morning is pretty far away from Friday 5 PM, so I wasn't particularly enjoying my day. Let me tell you - HOLY MOLY these are the best cream puffs I have ever had. YUM. Go get one. Or 5."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-12-04,1,"I LOVE cream puffs and eclairs. They're probably my favorite dessert and I have a serious sweet tooth, so that's saying something. So I was really disappointed when a bakery dedicated to cream puffs was so, meh. They didn't have chocolate cream and the vanilla wasn't that impressive. The shell was exactly as it should be, crisp and light. But the filling was a letdown since I was anticipating something more than okay. Not great, not bad but okay isn't what you want when you're eating something that's bad for you. You want to eat something that is worth the extra time you spend on the treadmill. If you're looking for an acceptable cream puff this is the place to go. If you want a great cream puff look elsewhere.

Be warned that the entrance isn't very stroller friendly"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-12-03,4,"Very tasty and efficient. Staff isn't overly friendly but does its job well. The puffs are really delicious unlike any frozen/ store bought pastry. 

There is often promotions as well that seem pretty good. A bit out of place but very nice."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-12-01,5,"Get the vanilla filling. Amazing cream puffs, it's totally worth coming to Upper west for these amazing cream puffs!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-11-30,5,Definitely the best cream puffs in nyc! Love the original and chocolate puffs. The green tea is a bit sweet.
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-11-09,2,Stopped by the store just to try a matcha latte. Kind of have a shruggie response - it's not out of this world but it's not the worst thing I've ever had. Wouldn't go out of my way to this place in the future.
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-11-01,5,Even tho the place is small but who can resist the best cream puff ever. We r likeeeeee it alot. It takes 45 minutes from my apartment but I don't mind to go....
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-10-29,3,What a let down . I expected a more multidimensional pastry and this was just a plain Jane . My mother makes very similar puff pastries with ease and I couldn't help but think how much less of a quality these were . I think they can do more with these in terms of texture such as incorporating nuts or even using different fillings etc because they all seem to use the same filling . The green tea was the most disappointing of the three I tried with the chocolate being my favorite.
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-10-27,5,"nom nom nom.

Seriously, there are few places that I just can't resist grabbing something at and BP totally makes that list."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-10-01,4,"Really tasty cream puffs. Southeast Asian origin. Large or small cream puffs available. Not much drink variety. Tiny, with a few seats but a must try if you are in the neighborhood."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-09-22,2,"I drove from downtown to buy some puffs, but when I came at 8:50 pm they were closed. They are supposed​ to work till 9 pm as advertise. Very disapointed"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-09-18,5,This place is delicious! The puffs never ever disappoint!  The young ladies that helped us were super courteous.
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-09-16,4,"I use to not be a big fan of cream puffs, but I guess I just hadn't had a good one because Beard Papa's single handedly changed that! The cream puffs here are awesome and I love that you have the ability to customize both the shell and the filling. I just wish they had all of the fillings available on a daily basis, but hey I can't complain too much because so far I've enjoyed a Beard Papa's cream puff regardless of what filling they're offering that day."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-09-10,4,"This place is a bit of a trek for me since I live in Brooklyn.  I think I come to the upper west side every 5-6 years so that is when I visit Beard Papa's.  I used to go more often when they had a downtown location at Astor Place but it closed.  The line can be long on weekends but it moves fast.  I ordered the original cream puff with hazelnut cream and a matcha angel food cake.  Their cream puffs are always good - crispy shell, fluffy interior, and fresh cream inside.  The hazelnut was delicious and its seasonal for the fall.  I believe they have mango in the summer.  The matcha angel food cake was tasty as well - small but a perfect portion for me and the cake was light yet fluffy.  I'll be back when I'm in the area so see you again in 5-6 years."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-09-04,5,"I don't generally like cream puffs (or eclairs), but I just inhaled three of these beauties and I only regret that I didn't order more. 

I tried both the matcha and hazelnut flavors, and I can't decide which one I like better. 

Hazelnut tastes even better than Nutella (who knew that was possible???). The matcha cream is the ideal green tea flavor and sweetness. The shell is slightly crispy but soft, and not too sweet. Just perfect. 

SO AMAZING, I can't wait to come back"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-09-01,3,"They were okay, maybe I'm just not that into cream puffs.  I've had better."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-08-31,4,"I come here time to time to get a box of cream puffs, as they are my mom's favorite. I used to love their quick service and delicacy in preparing the puffs before the renovation last year. For some reason, it has changed for the worse upon completion of the renovation, hence the missing star. The new employees seem to change every time I visit now. It looks like they recently got rid of the coupon system as well. I'm not so sure what the manager is trying to do with the service anymore."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-08-30,5,"Came here for their 14 anniversary deal. I ordered 6 cream puffs. 3 Matcha, 2 original and 1 eclair chocolate cream puff. Matcha was 30% off, original 50% off and eclair chocolate was 30% off. I follow beard papa on Instagram so when i saw this great deal I had to go. I had beard papas in the past before the renovation. After the renovation the place is bigger and more spacious. They have outdoor seating too. It was kind of a hike to travel to for cream puffs. I miss the Astor place location. The cashier was nice and put the box of cream puffs in a bag for me to go. I can't see the inside of the box since it has a label fresh product consume by today. When I got home and opened the box of cream puffs I realized I only had five creams puff. But receipt states 6 cream puffs. A little unhappy about the missing original cream puffs. Hope it was just a mistake. The cream puffs were so good I forgot about being unhappy about the missing cream puff. My favorite is the Matcha one. So fresh and not super sweet. Perfect sweetness. Any sweeter I wouldn't be able to handle. You can input your phone number on machine in the front to get points towards a free cream puff. It's the five stars rewards. $1 equals 1 points and 50 points is a free cream puff. I hope to see beard papas open more store in NYC. Since beard papas first started in Osaka Japan. Definitely going back to try more cream puffs. Follow Beard Papas on Instagram for more great deals and seasonal flavors for their cream puffs."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-08-26,5,"Pretty good cream puffs. Very light and not too sweet which is a plus. The pastry itself was crispy and they actually give a good amount of cream for such a small puff. I'm actually glad that they still have this store around since the last time I had it was back when I was in junior high school (10+ years). I usually go with the vanilla or green tea flavors which is delicious. As much as I love green tea anything, the green tea eclair was just okay - not sure if it was the texture of the green tea on top of the cream puff. Overall I do recommend and will definitely come back again."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-08-19,5,"BEST CREAM PUFFS EVER. I only come here for their cream puffs because they are delicious. They're not too sweet and the fillings are extremely creamy. Their eclairs are a bit sweeter than their original and milk n honey cream puffs. My favorite cream puffs are the ones with the green tea filling. Make sure you eat the cream puff the same day you buy it-- that's when they're the most delicious & the most fresh. 

This location is small, so don't expect a lot of seats. Their employees are nice. They have a punch card-- $5 per punch and 10 punches = 1 free cream puff!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-08-17,4,"The matcha puff was soo good, not too sweet, light n fluffy. $3.50 for decwnt suze puff. 

The mochi icecream was also yum too. Basic icecream surrounded with thin layer of mochi."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-08-09,4,"I am not a dessert person. Even when I eat desserts its most likely a cheesecake, pie or icecream.

The cream puff almost hits all those corners.

I had no idea what to expect with a name like Beard Papas and a wife that would not tell me what it was. When we arrive, it looks like most frozen yogurt sports, crazy bright colors to make you feel warm inside, ok. The display literally looks like any videogame when you happen to walk into a bakery, definitely a joke just for gamers. By the time I sat down with a coffee, I was pleasantly surprised.

In the display they simply have the crust. They actually go thru the trouble of injecting the filling by the order, and this is what makes it all worth it. Im not familiar with cream puffs, assuming you arent either, this is like ice cream covered in pie crust. That first bite throws you for a loop, because you dont expect it to be so light and flaky as well as delicious. To be honest, my coffee was a bit ehh, but this is about the cream puffs.

Not to bring you too much into my business, but at this time my wifes cousin is in the hospital and luckily he is surrounded by family every single day. We brought these over, and the entire box of mini ones was GONE before they could even ask what they were or where they were from. Amazing and delicious.

Id say I would return again, but Ive been twice since my first visit, so its a sure thing now!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-08-08,5,"This is one of the few places in NY where you can reliably get excellent food. I haven't had all the items (I plan to), but what I've had has been delicious, fresh, the pastry crispy and the filling delectable. There are too many food shops in NYC, and most of them are dreadful. This place, with a modest store front and no marketing, is truly a success story. 
PS. But they've reduced the choices of flavors and no longer have dulce de leche. Boooo."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-07-28,5,Probably my favorite place ever. Just waiting for the day where I can get my very own cream puff tower!!
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-07-24,2,We stopped by on Saturday around 8 PM. They only had 3 plain cream puffs left and nothing else. We bought them and tried them at home. The puffs were really disappointing. The cream was way too runny and the shell was all wrong. Do yourself a favor and go Bibble & Sip. They have the best earl grey cream puffs!!
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-07-18,5,"My boss got me the cream puffs from here for my birthday and it was yummy! I have also stopped by here a few times, staff is nice, the place is clean and the food is good! What else can you ask for?"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-07-17,4,"I prefer the creme puffs at Bibble & Sip in midtown which are more decadent, but the creme puffs and especially the eclair creme puffs at Beard Papa's are delicious. They are light and tasty. The staff fills the puffs after you order it and you can choose the flavor: vanilla custard, chocolate, strawberry or matcha. The matcha filling is not overly sweet or overwhelming but light and creamy. The angel cakes are made with rice flour and the cakes are super light and fluffy. The puffs are $3-$4."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-07-08,1,"This place has the worst service ever. They do not carry any variety of milk and the staff is rude and non-cooperative. I would not suggest this place to anyone who likes coffee and the UWS vibe. The drinks are not even made well and they do not carry mugs. Stunned by the lack of quality, variety, professionalism and service. Do go at your own risk!"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-07-08,3,Just not as good as before the renovation and the Japanese bakers with so much attention to detail. Before the choux were incredible now they are good.
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-07-06,5,"When a place tries, I give them the benefit of the doubt. That being said, thumbs up! I was happy with the service and coffee :)"
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-07-02,3,"When it's good, it's great. The cream puff pastry is puffy and delicious, perfectly paired with the filling. When it's not good, it's terrible. Soggy/stale pastry just doesn't hit quite the same spot. Out of the last 4-5 times that I've been here, it's been good once."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-07-01,5,"Discovered this place when my kids were young, now it's still one of our favorites. We often stop here after eating dinner on the UWS. My only complaint is that they close a 9PM, which makes it tough to get a late night dessert here. The freshly filled cream puffs and Paris Brests are great."
236,beard-papas-new-york,2017-06-23,4,"Was going to go to Levain's for some cookies, but the line was insanely long on a Sunday afternoon (especially since it was Father's Day). Came here instead with a group of 6 to grab a quick cream puff each before going to the 5 PM Hillsong album launch at Beacon Theatre.

Place is tiny, so easier to get a box to go. You can mix & match eclairs and cream puffs in a box of 6 or a dozen! About $3 each. Light and not too sweet. I only tried the green tea cream puff, but plan on coming back to try more if I'm ever in the area again."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2020-07-06,4,"Love this cafe! Super friendly staff and great service. Got avocado toast, and pan de queso with iced coffee and it was all wonderful. Price is a bit high but a good cafe to come to for a treat :)"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2020-05-01,5,They have such a wide selection of goods and the owner is so nice! I needed a condolence basket and even though they were closed they still pulled through and created something for me. The transaction was so smooth and I even received pictures of the order. Definitely will be trying again!
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2020-03-17,4,"Love this place!! My wife and I really needed to use the bathroom so I real quick ordered something off the menu and got the code. We hung out for a while waiting for my friend and this place is very cozy!! They had a good selection of espresso drinks, pastries, and sandwiches. I will be back!!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2020-03-04,3,"coffee is ok if you want have coffee or bakery, but this is not the place for using internet, very very slow, just leave and go to the Starbucks next to the street"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2020-03-01,4,Had a chocolate walnut brownie and it was unbelievable. Lots of lovely coffee and smoothie choices and cute casual atmosphere to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee. Great little stop on our last weekend trip to NYC.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2020-02-23,5,"This is my new favorite coffee shop in NYC.  Two reasons why:

1)  Great tasting coffee
2)  Each cup is made fresh

I've never been to a coffee shop where the regular coffee was not pre-made and sitting in a vacuum-insulated tank.  This place makes every cup fresh through the espresso machine.  Every cup!

It can take a few minutes to get a cup but you are rewarded with some of the best coffee you could find.

This location has ample seating space and an individual bathroom.  There is also an outside terrace with seating as well."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2020-02-20,5,"Really cozy place to drop in for a quick bite or to get some work done. Even though it's located in the midst of tourist central, I definitely plan on being a regular here. Solid food and caffeine. I've tried the mushroom quiche and Carlitos sandwich both of which were delicious. Latin music always playing in the background = VIBES. Friendly service and abundant outlets are always a plus too!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2020-02-15,5,"I loved everything about this coffee shop: space, decor, service and, of course, they provide delicious coffee from one of my favorite regions for coffee in the world. It is located off the beaten path but still a walkable distance to a lot of attractions. I could tell it is very popular amongst the locals as many of them were working/doing homework/hanging out.
I really enjoyed my cappuccino with almond milk and wanted to try one of their pastries as they looked pretty good but we just had a big meal so maybe next time ;)
Overall, it was one of the best coffees we've had in NYC, and they do have tons of competitors on every single corner!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2020-02-10,4,"Cute little coffee shop. Fairly big for NYC, but was very busy on the weekend. It was hard to maneuver around due to how busy it was and how close the tables were pushed together. The egg and cheese sandwich I had was delicious!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2020-01-17,5,"Coffee,  food , service and music , all is pretty good. An special thank you to Daniela for all her hospitality and excellent service."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-12-09,5,"Love this local place in midtown west for coffee and also they have some great breakfast options! Everyone is friendly, service is quick, and they have a pretty large menu. For a local Hell's Kitchen coffee / breakfast snack spot, this place is great! I especially like their egg and avocado breakfast options, also plenty of seating!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-12-05,5,"Cute coffee place, and the Colombian coffee is brewed well. The prices are ok for New York  and service is friendly. The eggs were on the salty side, but being a coffee place I was happy the espresso and the latte were very good. This is a good place to spend time reading a book or working."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-11-19,5,"Good coffee, good atmosphere and the staff is friendly.
We had a cappuccino, the place is nice to have a short conversation. 
Conveniently close to the piers and the Jarvits Center."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-11-19,5,"Go-to neighborhood coffee spot. The coffee is great, the food is good, and the workers are really nice. Their chai is delicious- but if you don't like it sweet then it's not for you. The chicken salad is great. If you want a reasonably priced/sized breakfast I recommend the waffles+fruit. Very comfortable seating/lounging areas. Wonderful outdoor patio in the summer. Dog friendly."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-10-17,5,"TLDR: great coffee shop with some bites and a lot of latin flavor.
___

I came in for a midday pick me up. I went with a French vanilla latte. It was a little crisp out and this warmed my soul. The coffee was strong. The vanilla was smooth. It was great.

As soon as I walked in and heard the Spanish music playing, I knew I'd love this place. It's a very Cozy atmosphere. Warm wood colors. Modern chic.

Not only do they have coffee, they also have Various baked goods and Colombian snacks. Didn't try the food, but everything looked great! 

Overall it was a great pitstop for me!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-10-09,2,"It is another coffee shop here in NYC. I am not a big fan of the BIG chain we all know of, so I am always looking for something new and exciting. However, this was not it. The staff is great. The coffee hot. It is mild at best. And not as strong as I like. I refuse to add another shot of something stronger. Coffee is coffee and should be strong naturally. There are plenty of other places to go to."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-09-11,3,"Mixed experiences here. I like the concept of the place, and the servers can be nice most of the time. I know they work really hard. The food and beverages are usually good. 

But the music is usually way too loud--that might be fun for the workers, but not for the customers. It's just stressful. 

Also, I don't know if they still have that metal water container, but the water from that thing always tasted foul. Like, really foul, like it was never cleaned. Also a couple of times they served me fruit that had visible mold growing on it. 

The other thing is that is annoying is sometimes you can't tell if this is a cafe or a pet shop. I love dogs, but not in restaurants. The Health Department should not be allowing dogs in there at all, but sometimes customers even put their dogs right on the counter where the food is served. That is definitely not sanitary. If they allow that, it makes me wonder about all of their food safety."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-09-03,4,"I find the coffee shop itself very nice and clean. A nice lay out and comfortable. But, the music can be a bit rowdy for a coffee shop sometimes. Also, I find the $5 credit limit a tad annoying. This is a coffee establishment where more than 50% of menu items are below $5. This means I either have to change my order by ordering something more than $5 or bring cash in - each and every time I want a regular coffee. A few times I've gone to Starbucks because I don't have cash. If you're a business, you need to set up the correct payment methods to allow for customers to pay with any method of payment or else you're definitely losing sales. 
Thanks."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-09-01,5,"I stumbled upon this spot in a recent trip to New York! Great little spot with a homie vibe, the coffee was amazing, it was a perfect place to catch some shade from the summer Ny heat"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-08-07,4,"Stopped by after lunch, love the vibe here. Coffee has been the best I've had so far in NYC. Tried the carrot cake, a bit dry but still tasted great. The muffins looked great, will give one a try if I get a chance to stop by."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-08-07,5,"Love the latte here. Actually the best I have had so far this year. The rich flavor had a touch of chocolate, the bitter flavor blends well with milk. I am not a coffee person but cannot love it more!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-08-02,4,"Came here for a quick bite and drink, the iced tea was only $3! I also got a egg and cheese sandwich on toast-which is what I will be mainly basing my review on. This toast was actually ROCK HARD & burnt! See attached photo, I almost choked on the bread so I asked them for a remake of the toast. 

They were happy to remake it however, it still wasn't that good? I mean it was just egg and toast with cheddar sliced cheese so maybe it was the wrong choice haha. 

The iced tea was pretty basic but still third quenching. 

A cute short lady helped me pay for the items as well as remade my sandwich for me-I wanted to give 3 stars but I changed it to 4 for her! (Also I didn't want to base it on just the items I ordered) Overall, I recommend sticking to their coffee/lattes and not deviating from their main specialties"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-07-22,4,"The sizes are so small and expensive. My mom's vanilla chai was, as she put it, okay... could've used more chai. My dads blackberry strawberry smoothie was ""pretty good."" My green smoothie was great and you could really taste the ginger while not being overpowering. 4/5 stars."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-07-13,1,"Unsanitary!!!!!! 

I often stop by this coffee house for a nice bite along with some iced tea.  They have a great coffee cake.  Today, my coffee cake came on a dirty plate. Because I frequent the spot I walked to the counter and discreetly told the server about the issue. She decided to give me the same piece of cake on another plate sitting on a napkin!!!  
WTH?!!!  

I took the plate and asked for my money back. The owner was sitting close by and inquired. When I told her what happened, I said, ""this is not the way you treat a customer."" She then replied.. ""we know how to treat our customers"" .  She never even offered an apology!!  I got my money and left.... and they allowed me to do so!!! 

So I'm standing outside now choosing to post a review. Nasty  practices at the counter makes you wonder what the bell is going on in the kitchen!!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-06-29,5,Amazing coffee and tasty food. I come here everyday and I love the entire team. It's my daily go to place and I cannot start my day without a cup of Romeo and Juliet Coffee! The eggs and toast and the sour cream apple pie are two of my favorite things on the menu! The soups are also so great! I could keep going and going.... love you guys!
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-06-22,1,"On God do not get a matcha latte unless you like the taste of powder and water. If so, theres no better place on this earth. I threw that shit away before exiting it was so bad. I ordered avocado toast it came with a smidge of avocado??????..... was God punishing me?"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-05-28,3,"Fast service. A lot of space to sit. One of the few restaurants this far west. The salad I got was questionable - the chicken was either really fatty or under cooked. My boyfriends however was fine so maybe it was just me. 

The other members of my party got egg based dishes and all seemed satisfied. Nothing to write home about."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-05-20,4,"We were scheduled to take a Circle Line cruise and reached the Pier 83 early. To escape the NY rains, we  walked to this cafe, a cozy space. They have a lot of food and dessert options. I ordered a Cappuccino and picked up a Vegan Chocolate Brownie from the counter. We spent a delightful time at the cafe with good food and warmth."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-05-19,1,"Just because you have a monopoly on the area, doesn't mean you can just charge a lot of money and pour minimal liquid + add a lot of ice. I've stopped coming here because of that. Last time we asked for less ice, the lady just took out some ice and did not give us more liquid. Wtf? Are you really going to lose money if coffee is charged at a premium already. It's just milk money, not like you are pouring additional shots of espresso...."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-05-05,5,"Good Coffee and good sándwiches. The People is nice. We had such a nice time. 
Thank you"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-05-05,5,"The peaple are nice, the coffee to, also the food and the ambient, I recomended this coffee place, is warm and fast."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-04-27,4,"My first stop after arriving in NYC - I needed a little bit of hometown delights!!! The place is very easy to find, a little bit small but very cozy. Like everything on NYC, don't expect any parking accommodations nearby but it doesn't matter as you will be walking most of the time anyway. 
I'm a huge coffee guy and I ordered a cappuccino with avocado toasts. The coffee was delicious very well brew and the avocado toast was a pretty nice breakfast plate. 
The service was better than most- why? I'm huge in customer obsession and customer the customer service in NYC literally SUCKS!!! But I liked the service at this place, I was greeted, smiles at and thanked.
I enjoyed this place for a quick stop and great food.
I recommend it 

- El Futbolero!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-04-25,4,"There's a few reasons why this place is a 4 and not a 5 for me. 

The pros is that the food is incredibly delicious. It is really good and from the moment we got there until we left traffic did not stop coming in which is always a great sign. They have a variety in their menu form breakfast to brunch and even afternoon sandwiches. You can also drink from coffee to coconut lemonade which is an absolute delight.

The reason why I give it a 4. I'm Colombian, so don't advertise ""pan de queso"" which means cheese bread if what they will give you is a pandebono. Even though the pandebono is a bread made with cheese, de actual Colombian cheese bread is something completely different so don't be fooled. Also, I ordered the Spanish tortilla and it was delicious!!! But, it was cold inside. This tells me that it is previously made and they just reheat it so I wasn't a fan of that. 

Overall, is a great spot for good food and delicious afternoon pastries."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-03-25,1,Very rude. The owner / manager yelled at me with disgust because I didn't hear my number called. Food was super low quality with no attention to aesthetics. If you eat at 7/11 this place might work for you. If looking for more conscious food and staff then pass.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-03-13,4,Cozy little coffee place. Great coffee. It's fun to watch all the dogs and their owners walk by.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-03-12,4,Great spot away from the hustle and bustle. Love the Latin music and ambience. Very smooth flat white.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-03-10,5,Loved this little cafe for breakfast when we stayed across the street for a gala. The breakfast was amazing both days and a must try is the freshly squeezed orange juice. Cozy stop if you're in the area for a quick lunch or coffee.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-03-07,1,"I live in a building nearby and this shop isn't even a block away but I will walk the extra blocks to the Starbucks just so I can receive my coffee without the attitude.

I've been here a handful of times and I was never wowed or felt like it's anything special . They aren't even consistent with the products or service levels . You may get a great cashier and a great coffee. Next time you get a rude cashier and burnt coffee.

The incident that sealed the deal for me was  engaging with a not -so-friendly cashier woman who was agitated that I didn't speak loud enough (for her) or I didn't know which Latin pastry I had the last time and I wanted again. If I was a cashier and engaging with a customer and wanting to give good customer service I would of simply asked 'what did it look like?'or 'what was the flavor?' . I guess she didn't have the time to do that with the long line of one person behind me. But no worries  after she was done shaming me for speaking low and rolling her eyes because I couldn't remember the pastry she was overly friendly to the customer behind me . After gazing in the pastry window I saw the one I had before so I ordered it. I thanked her(loudly ) to which she didn't thank me back(her lips were pressed tightly as if she didn't even want me to think she uttered an 'you're welcome') and she gave me back the wrong change ( my total was $5.17 . I gave her $6. She gave me back 2 quarters ). I guess I'm not the typical customer she was used to seeing but I do indeed live not even more than 1 minute walk away and hope the next time I come here and I encounter the older lady with the grey bob that she is more accommodating and ready to give excellent customer service (I mean, it is your job ...right?). On the other hand I think I'll just go to Starbucks , lol !"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-02-26,5,"I live around the corner and this place is sooooooo good. Besides their delicious coffee, their food is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the pan de bono. It's my absolute favorite. If I had no self-control I would be eating these for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-02-24,5,"This is a super inviting and comfy coffee shop nestled a little out of the hustle of times square. After our red eye flight, my friend and I got into the area at around 8 in the morning and had to wait until 11 for check in. Needless to say, we were exhausted (we're from California, so the time difference made us quite the walking zombies). This coffee shop was very close to our place, so this shop felt like the promised Land as it was perfectly quiet and spacious. 

The aesthetic is very hip and modern, but also very cozy in comparison to a lot of other coffee shops. There is a lovely fireplace and a few armchairs along with many small and long tables dispersed throughout the room. The usage of space is very well done. 

I had the dirty chai latte along with scrambled eggs and toast. The breakfast options are great for the price, and I was quite satisfied with my simple first meal of the day (but to be fair, I may have been in a biased state because I was so hungry and tired). 

The ladies here are so friendly and nice, which is the main reason why I gave this place a high rating. Their personalities were so inviting, it made us feel very welcome in this hectic city. I adore this coffee shop, and I recommend it to any travelers!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-02-10,5,"Came here this morning and fell in love. The Juan Luis Guerra playing all morning + most delicious vanilla latte warmed my heart. I had the Waffles with fruit + pan de queso as well and wow wow wow. I don't even like waffles but these were the perfect combo of soft and crunchy ahhh! Pan de queso was so good, perfect amount of cheesey that didn't feel gross. I got another one to go- and added an OJ which was fresh and yummy as well. Just the kindness staff, that was on point with the volume of people walking in and out. Gracias! 


Made my day- xo from Philly. See you soon."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-02-10,5,"This place is amazing! The orange juice is fresh, the tortilla española is so authentic and delicious! I'd come back here in a minute. It makes you feel like you escaped the city and went to Colombia! 10/10 would come back."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-02-08,5,"Probably the best latte I've had. The people here are nice. The ambiance is inviting. I love the Latin music they have on. It has a warm and inviting vine about it. I dropped in to get my daily latte, write and brainstorm some work stuff. Since I'm visiting from San Francisco, I won't have the luxury of coming back daily, but this will surely be my go-to coffee shop when I revisit."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-01-31,4,"This coffee shop is inspired by Colombian culture by both it's food and atmosphere. I usually order a flavored latte of some kind (with almond milk) and I'm always satisfied. There have been occasions when the latte is sweeter than usual, but I don't mind it. I have tried the pour over coffee and I enjoy it as well. I always order their Pan de Queso (or Pan de Oro). They're tasty and decent in size, never been disappointed. I highly recommend them, and they're only $2 a piece. 

They have brunch/lunch specials, and sell alcohol for those whom like to have a glass of wine or coffee cocktail while working. Although it's a small space, there is room to work or hang out at small tables, the bar against the windows and high communal tables. 

My one complaint is the intensity of the music played. It is louder than I would prefer so it's difficult to concentrate at times. Even with headphones on I can still hear it, not to mention they have the same songs playing on repeat sometimes. If the music was just softer (aka not blasting so loud) I'd stay longer to get work done."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-01-20,1,"They don't make actual coffee here, they make americanos. when they first made my drink they made it with espresso that had been sitting out an oxidizing."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2019-01-15,5,This is my goto place for a Latte when I'm at the Javits Center. A great location near Senaca grocery store and Gotham Market for lunch options.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-11-17,5,"This is one of those ""how did I never know about this"" places.

They brew coffee several different ways, implementing methods that are not common at many other shops.  

And there's ample seating and space too.  Outdoor seating as well."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-11-12,2,"I come here often, since I teach yoga nearby. This review is for the service. More times than not, my order is always wrong in some way. Make sure to repeat your order several times, and watch them very carefully. I always order the same thing... Cafe au Lait with OAT milk for HERE. Sometimes it comes in a To-Go cup (I try to save on waste), sometimes they put regular instead of oat milk, or almond instead of oat milk, and claim the receipt says almond because they don't have a button for Oat Milk (there should be a better system or communication between baristas). So many mistakes, I expect them now. I repeat my order several times at the counter, and ask when the beverage is made if it is all correct. They should be way more attentive to their orders. Thank goodness I'm not lactose intolerant, I would have been sick several times... on the plus side, they have plugs, and quite ample seating. Unfortunately the Wi-Fi doesn't work whenever I've tried it."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-11-10,5,Great cappuccino!!! Been coming here for year and it's always delicious! The arepa is also so yummy!
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-11-10,1,"The staff is rude. They made a mistake and put almond milk in my coffee vs reg milk and when I tried to correct it they said I ordered incorrectly. I don't ever drink almond milk. The staff then bad mouthed me in Spanish. Surprise, I'm Hispanic too. I told her I understood what they were saying so she rolled her eyes and walked away."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-11-06,5,Delicious and Great Service  Kids had Hot Chocolate and it was perfect.   Great spot to stop in and wait for our Harbor Cruise
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-10-11,5,"Love their coffee and teas. Espresso not so much. Super nice staff and great outdoor seating,  great for dogs owners. Nice snacks too"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-09-28,5,"The environment here is so cozy. Everyone is friendly and the food and coffee is the best in this district. Sitting here for lunch is really a pleasure, especially in a cold autumn morning."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-09-17,5,Great coffee and food! Very friendly staff and lots of space. Nice ambience and clean.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-09-11,3,"Little disappointed with the service, the coffee and the arepa was amazing, highly recommend."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-09-11,5,Such a cute coffee shop! The avocado and egg on toast was delicious! Definitely coming back here to sit down with coffee and get some work done.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-09-06,4,Great coffee and drinks (especially the Colombian lemonade!). Good work environment but the WiFi is really slow and laggy.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-09-03,5,"Probably my favorite place this trip to nyc. Friendly service and the offerings were plentiful. Got iced caramel lattes and papaya, mango and apple smoothie both visits. On the last visit, decided to tryout their breakfast and pastry. Breakfast and sandwich was pretty good and LOVED the pan de queso! Go try it out!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-09-02,5,Coming from Australia the coffee at Romeo and Juliet is fantastic and close to the best I've had in my week here so far. The location is bustling and there is a good selection of breakfast and food options.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-08-20,4,"I'm a pretty boring coffee drinker since I usually drink my coffee black with some form of sweetener in it.  First thing I noticed was their cute little outdoor patio.  A fan of the decor here as there's communal tables for people to enjoy their beverage, food and Wi-Fi.  One of the more interesting coffee menus I've seen with a variety of flavors for coffee drinkers to enjoy. Can't contest to how the food is since I didn't order any food, but the parties did look delicious.  This place offers a different kind of espressos, hot coffee/drinks, iced coffee and even alternative preparation options.  I mean it's pretty much a coffee drinkers dream.  The one issues I had here was the service.  When I ordered my black coffee the female behind the register looked at me as if I was wasting her time.  I don't usually complain about service, but I was a bit taken back by her reaction to my order. Despite the one unpleasant employee, I would recommend coming here and trying one of their creative coffee drinks."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-07-30,2,"Service was attentive. The food wasn't what I expected, some are canned foods. For a Colombian​ Coffee, it should have more latino​ choices on​ the menu. That was the reason why we went there. I was looking for pan de bono (ran out), arepas colombianas, empanadas..."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-07-24,5,"I am glad I got the opportunity to dine in here . I bought a iced latte with the Carlitos sandwhich and it was incredibly delicious, especially the sandwhich. The staff was super nice and the place had a nice relaxing ambiance to it. However, it was very expensive , I payed $18 for just a sandwhich and coffee . I'm glad it was atleast tasty and plated very fancy . I would honestly come back and try the whole menu lol."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-07-16,5,"Great coffee and iced coffee and breakfast.  Reasonable prices. Nice atmosphere. We ate here twice during our 3 days in New York.  Delicious quiche, avocado toast.  It's all good.  I even bought coffee beans to have at home."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-07-08,5,"I've ordered breakfast from here quite a few times and have never been disappointed with the quality of food. The packaging they send is simple but sensible and the food? Yum. I usually get 2 scrambled eggs, Spanish cheese, and chorizo and the arepa. So delicious. So amazing. 

I love that they have different sizes for their iced lattes and coffees. Such a great spot. Yummmmmmm. 

I'm a fan and will remain a regular."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-06-28,5,"Great Cappuccino, slightly on the lighter roast side, so the flavor pops.  It was flavorful and delicious from the first sip to the last foam at the end.  Not sure what the flavor profile would be, wasn't grassy or bright, but I really liked it.

The Arepa de Chócolo was my first and was delicious!  Certainly a very tasty dish and was great with the coffee."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-06-20,5,"Great breakfast, friendly staff! Quiche is amazing, waffle is sweet and creamy.

Layout isn't super spacious, but the decor is well appointed and hip. Like stepping into a little Columbia's Cafe."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-06-15,1,"My friend and I went to this coffee shop in hopes of finding a good study cafe we could rely on. When we first walked in, I bought a Passion Fruit Juice (which was distasteful as all they did was put water and passion fruit in the blender without adding the right amount of sugar to help the natural tart taste of the fruit) and my friend didn't buy anything at the time as she planned to buy a drink a little later. A woman then approached my friend and told her she needed to buy something and that she could not bring in food from other stores (my friend went to 7/11 and bought a sandwich while I sipped on the Passion Fruit Smoothie from Romeo & Juliet). My friend told her she would buy something, she just didn't want a drink when she walked in, but that she understood she had to buy something and she planned on buying a drink in a bit. A man then approached my friend, (who apparently was the owner or manager of the store) pulled up a chair, turned it around and leaned against the back of it, while leaning towards my friend. My friend's seat was against the back wall of the cafe, so it felt as though she was cornered. He told her she wasn't his client and that she was using his services, like the wifi without consuming something from the cafe. He was talking at her in a condescending manner not giving her a chance to speak. My friend was trying to let him know that she would be buying a drink but at this point, the man did not care to hear anything she was saying and was more focused on speak down to her and make her feel unwelcomed. 
We completely understand the business perspective of consuming a product to receive other services like the WiFi, which is why I bought the Passion Fruit Juice in the first place; however, the approach of this man was completely unacceptable. My friend explained that she just told the other woman that she would buy something because she understood she needed to and he wasn't having it. I tried to explain how his approach was distasteful and he kept talking over me telling us that my friend isn't a client and she shouldn't be using his services in the cafe. He didn't give us an opportunity to speak so we quickly left the store as we had felt extremely uncomfortable by this altercation. If this is the way the store manager or owner treats people they certainly don't deserve anyone's money or service and should learn how to treat people or address a concern in a more respectful manner."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-06-03,5,"Nice little coffee spot with some great variety of coffees, juices and food. Cozy and quaint atmosphere with rustic decor.  Our orders were well made and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Will definitely come back."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-05-26,4,"My boss and I were in town for the SURTEX show and on our walk saw this cute little coffee shop.

Loved their logo and space. They had a lot of drinks and food to offer.

I ordered the turkey quiche, which was amazing.

However the service wasn't 5 stars. There were 2 women working and they seemed very scatter brained. They forgot a lot of things and were trying to multitask with other customers while serving other customers.

They had good chai tea lattes and quiche though.

Seems like a great space to do work or school."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-05-25,4,"The food and drinks here are delicious. They offer so many different types of coffee which sound amazing, like Oreo cookie coffee. I had a piña colada flavored tea (over ice) and it wasn't sweet but still full of flavor and refreshing. I also ordered the arepa without fully understanding what it was and boy am I glad I did. It's a Colombian dessert of sweet corn bread type of cake with a slice of queso blanco on top. It was filling and so yummy!

I was a bit annoyed that they had so many different menus with their items listed all over the place. Then I found a menu with more drink listings and more food items and I wish I had more time to look through it. The staff were unhelpful and made me feel rushed. They just kept talking amongst themselves. Also they delivered food to the table for some people and not for others. When I paid for my order I didn't add the tips because I like to leave cash with my empty plates/cups. However they made me walk up to the counter to pick up my order while they delivered the food for other people. I guess they are only motivated by pre-paid tips.

Other than my experience with the workers, I would come back for the food."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-05-21,5,I'm visiting for business and was looking for a coffee shop near my hotel. This is a great neighborhood place. Coffee is strong and super smooth. Croissant was moist yet flaky. Great casual elegance vibe with lots of friendly folks.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-05-09,1,Asked for a Frapp. Instead I was given an over priced watered down cup of coffee with lots of ice cubes.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-04-30,5,"A very inviting coffee place, lovely people ( think it's family run? ). Love the variety of coffee choices! Many home made & Columbian yummies. Try the Grand Pa coffee if you love black coffee and are adventurous  will certainly come back soon"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-04-27,5,"I can't say a whole lot about the food, but the coffee is very good. The price is fine for NYC. The coffee is done nicely, and not very bitter at all. I got a cappuccino and my wife got a latte. They were both very good. This was the first spot we stopped when we got off the water taxi. It's a short walk from the landing up 42nd to store. The food looked good, but we had just eaten breakfast. You can't go wrong with the coffee from here though."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-04-17,4,"Pretty good little cafe. Ordered the mushroom quiche and it came with a delicious salad. Nice area, not too crowded."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-04-04,5,"Perfect spot for a breakfast or quick bits. Amiable staff, decent coffee. 2 tapas with wine/beer for $9.99 - after 12 pm!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-03-27,5,"Cozy place with tons of seating for those wanting to get some work done or sit and chat, warm environment. Lots of fun coffee options like Dream Coffee and Oreo shakes in addition to your regular standbys."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-03-10,5,"I just had the best cup of coffee in my life! I'm not a true coffee drinker, so I was ooen to try something new. the Grand Ma is a slow pour over coffee, and it was a beautiful process to watch in thus charming cozy space. it was also delicious!!
PS arepas also available"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-02-10,4,"Great place to live on top of! Staff is generally very friendly, despite how busy they always are. They make great coffee and I love their cranberry muffins! Randomly, they also serve select booze and in the summer it's so much fun to sit outside and bask in the sun with a glass of sangria!! How many folks can say their favorite coffee house doubles as bar?"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-01-13,2,Probably not the best way to deliver Coffee. Spilled everywhere. Food wasnt that good either.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2018-01-04,5,"Wonderful! Nice hot or cold beverages! Yummy snacks treats and lunch! I'm happy to find a place that when you order a cappuccino it's prepared perfect! Nice, clean atmosphere. I would recommend Romeo and Juliet coffee and bistro!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-12-29,2,"I've been here twice. The first experience was okay; the latte tasted fine, wasn't too busy, the music was low enough so that people could do work. The second experience was just terrible. I walked in and stood by the counter waiting to have my order taken. The woman standing behind the register knew I was there and literally would not even ask me what I wanted to order. The latte did not even taste like it had espresso shots in it. Please improve your customer service!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-11-12,2,"Pros: Coffee is really good! We got a couple lattes and they were nice and hot and definitely well-made. Many people were ordering Americanos which leads me to believe those are good, as well. 

The food is okay. We ordered a waffle and an arepa (more about both below). The waffles comes with syrup in a single-serve KRAFT packet. Don't love this - nothing against KRAFT, but I'd at least expect syrup to be served in a bowl, ideally a little warm. It felt a little like we were at McDonald's. The arepa was fine, the corn was pretty hard but I can see past that for the flavor. 

Cons: The service! From the moment we walked into the store, it felt like we had done the barista wrong. While giving our order, we changed one of the coffees from a drip to a latte, and she got upset because they were about to start processing the drip coffee. She tried telling us it wasn't possible to change the order - before we had even completed giving the order and paying - but she gave in after a little back and forth, which was definitely not necessary. 

While waiting for our order, the barista called out saying the Nutella waffle was ready. After calling out a few times, we went up and let her know we ordered a waffle but with no Nutella. She asked if we could ""just have this one"" but due to an allergy we could not take it. After an eye-roll, she went back to the kitchen. We got the waffle and I stayed at the counter for a few minutes waiting for the arepa. After 6-7 minutes, the barista looked at me asking if she could help me, and I told her I was waiting for the arepa...she looked at me and said ""oh yeah!"" and I watched her pull out an arepa from the kitchen and throw it in the microwave. 

All in all, pretty disappointed. Had been wanting to try this place for a while and their outdoor situation always looked fun, but I think we'll stick to coffee to-go from here."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-11-09,3,"I've been trying to find my ""IT"" local coffee shop in Midtown and not go to Starbucks b/c of convenience and stability. 

Unfortunately, the search continues here. While the espresso is fair/good, the food isn't that great. And they limit your wifi for 2 hours! What? This drives me crazy crazy alone, but I do get it. Need to turn my hotspot or mifi! 

Things to Note:
1) Cute space with communal tables
2) Lots of fancy coffee drink options 
3) Tried the spanish omelette and meh, etc. but it comes with a small salad
4) WTH w/ 2 hour wifi limit
5) Lots of Breakfast pastries (ok on the croissant) and Food
6) Outdoor patio 

It's def. not 4.5 stars worthy - but if you need a pick me, absolutely."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-11-05,5,"This place is GREAT! Very cozy with lots of seating. $10 brekky special of ham, eggs, toast, yogurt parfait, and Colombian coffee. Everything tastes like it's made with love. LOVE I say! It's a good place."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-10-19,5,I came here to study and they have amazing coffee. I had the mocha and my husband had a caramel frappucino and both were delicious. There is a lot of seating available and I think this place make a great place to study!
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-10-05,1,"Bitter coffee, almost tastes like it's burnt. Ordered a decaf iced americano, and after the barista put in one shot they also poured some pre-made batch of coffee (espresso?) sitting on the espresso machine? Just literally an open batch of coffee, who knows what's in it and when they made it! Anyhow it must have been real coffee because this is definitely stronger than a regular decaf. Also the vibe of the place is weird...it seems like it's confused and can't decide which direction to go to. Neither homey nor modern."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-10-05,5,"Amazing coffee, good food, and plenty of space to spread out and get some work done, or lounge on the comfortable outdoor patio. Favorite coffee shop in Hell's Kitchen!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-10-04,5,"Best coffee place in the neighborhood, wonderful service and lovely atmosphere! I really love Mango Coconut Pineapple smoothie ... it's just delicious! I would recommend to try Coconut lemonade and sangria as well!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-09-15,5,5-stars as far as being a great place to bring a laptop and work for an hour or two. They have 2-hours of free wifi and a good amount of table space. Not too crowded in the late morning or afternoon. Some plugs along the walls. The staff is super nice.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-09-14,5,My hubby and I come here for coffee when we're in the neighborhood. It's his fav cappuccino spot. We usually order the arepa con queso which is really good. Our son knows this is our little spot as well because we had to the pg around the corner afterwards. Good service and a lot of variety on the menu.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-08-20,4,Very cute coffee shop! Easy to walk to.  The lines are quick. Only complaint is that sometimes they don't get your coffee order right. Could be because they're usually really busy or a language barrier.  - I always end up going back though! I've tried the sandwiches twice which were good too.  Nice place to to chill and get some work done on your laptop :) it's spacey too and always have a good vibe when I'm in there.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-08-09,4,Really cute place with an extensive drink menu. My only complaint is that the food menu is lacking.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-07-24,3,Nice vibe and good tea. The workers could be more friendly. Wouldn't plan to work there more than 2 hours because the wifi kicks you off and then requires you to create an account.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-07-07,5,"Finally found the real coffee in town. Everywhere else, no espresso, only latte with macchiato...
Romeo and Juliet has great coffee with so many choices. All the coffee makers are nice and kind of free spirit, enjoying what they are doing. Much better than Starbucks! 
Will try the breakfast here next time!"
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-07-05,1,"Customer service is really bad.  I went to 711 next door for my coffee and saw this place had baked goods and it looked like a place to check out. But I also has to use the bathroom and wanted to get the bathroom break out of the way before looking at the options to buy. So I asked about the bathroom,and the young lady rudely ignored me and I asked again and without looking at me she says ""for customers only!"" I proceeded to state that I was going to buy something, and I will even buy something quickly now just to use the bathroom and she charged me and walked away from the register without giving my purchase or receipt to me. I had to ask another woman behind the counter what's going on? I was so confused by her lack of customer service and friendliness. Would never recommend anyone to go there."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-06-30,5,"Great coffee and friendly service at this Hell's Kitchen coffee shop.  I stopped in here the other day for the first time and was not disappointed, my cappuccino was great and the girls who work here were very friendly.  They have a nice seating area out front where you can enjoy your coffee in the breeze coming off the river.  The tables out front kind of suck, they have a flexible lattice on the top of them so when I put my coffee down, it sank in and spilled a bunch everywhere, I had to be careful not to drip it on myself after that.  Also, the close proximity to the Lincoln Tunnel means that 100 trucks and buses are pouring by every 5 minutes, but you can't really help that.  All-in-all, great coffee shop that I'd come back to."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-06-12,4,"We really liked this little coffee shop, we were able to have a full breakfast with coffee for just under $20 for two of us. The coffee was so delicious and made fresh right in front of us. On the way out we ordered some iced coffees to go. 

My only issue was that the coffee fixings area has bottles with no labels, one I figured was simple syrup for iced coffee but it did nothing to sweeten the coffee, so maybe it wasn't simple syrup it kind of seemed just like water. A label on the bottles would have been nice and helpful. 

Otherwise is a very nice little place, clean and well cared for,  with limited inside and outdoor seating it was very cozy feeling, like you wouldn't mind spending some time there. Obviously convenient to nearby hotels I think they probably do a lot of local business as well. If in the area I would happily drop by for some of their delicious Colombian coffee."
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-06-09,4,Amazing place to sit down and chat! Grandma is the best coffee I've had in a while. Pecan pie is a little too sweet for me but almond croissant was good.
237,romeo-and-juliet-colombian-coffee-new-york,2017-06-05,3,"Love their juice and coffee. The coconut coffee was very creamy and not overly sweet, and had real coffee taste, although towards the end the sweetener was the only thing I could taste. It's a blended drink, but the ice was not well blended. It floated in the middle of the drink and every time I sucked it up, I felt like eating ice crystals. 

However, the service was way off. I came here twice and during both visits I was not greeted or even asked if I wanted anything, while I'd been standing there for a minute obviously waiting to be helped. There were three girls working, but they all seemed reluctant to serve customers voluntarily. You have to go up and call for their attention. 

More annoyingly, they didn't have the Lulo Coffee both times I was there, which were about a week apart. This place seems to be specialized in all kinds of coffee, but if you are out of these special drinks, at least make a note, telling people it was not available at the moment. 

The first time I ordered the Lulo Coffee, the girl made a mistake and made the juice instead. When I told her that I wanted the coffee, she was like ""Oh we don't have it"" and that is it! No apology at all and she turned to ]the next person. So rude and unprofessional. How could she assume that I knew they didn't have the coffee and make the juice without asking??!!

It wasn't pleasant experience, but coffee has no fault. I enjoyed their drinks.

P.S. They provide Time Warner 2-hour free wifi, but it was kinda slow."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-07-03,4,"3.5 stars: we've tried quite a few different varieties here over the last few months. Pepperoni, grandma, white, and even a salad on the side once (!) -- all were solid choices but I think the clear winner for me is the white pizza. They do it better than a couple others I've tried and I love adding on the spice bomb. Definitely a good option for pizza takeout."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-06-17,5,We absolutely love the pizza dough and their coffee. It's possibly the best pizza in nyc
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-05-21,5,"Let me shake off my rust of review-writing by saying how amazing my experience was with Corner Slice.

We ordered from them last week for lunch. We had the choice of either getting pizza or a hero. I went with the hero but was able to try a few bites of pizza as well. 

The chicken parm hero felt like it weighed 10 pounds in my hands because it was loaded with marinara sauce and cheese. It was very wholesome and very filling. 

But let's get to the gold ribbon pizza: I was able to take a few bites from my colleague's grandma cheese pizza. As previously stated by other Yelpers, Corner Slice uses focaccia bread for their slices. This is probably one of the best ideas yet! It is absolutely delicious with the sauce and cheese that they use. We usually use focaccia bread to mop up the excess sauce left after eating a pasta dish; with this preparation, we are literally doing just that with the pizza sauce and cheese. 

It's true what they say: Corner Slice is definitely on the expensive side. Their slices run for about $5 each, and their full pies are close to $30. But I think it's definitely worth it for the quality they provide.

Corner Slice has earned a new pizza-crazed patron!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-05-14,5,"I am not obsessed with pizza, but I do LOVE pizza. We were in search of a new pizza spot (our go to had temporarily closed) we came across this place. We got 2 pies, 1 plain and 1 plain with meatballs and were not disappointed. The bread is fluffy and crunchy all in one and is like focaccia bread. The sauce is flavorful, but not overpowering & the meatball addition OH MYY. I would 100% get this pizza forever. This is great fresh from the box and is just as good reheated. It is a bit pricey (I think we spent ~$60 for 2 pies), but I think it is a good use of your money - the dough is fluffy and very filling. You wont regret your decision!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-04-19,1,"I live in the building above the restaurant, and I ran down quickly to get a slice before they closed. The woman at the counter informed me with a nasty attitude that they were only taking online orders. For the record, I didn't know they were only taking online orders. I went outside the restaurant to complete an online order, and they cancelled my order. First and last time I'll ever come to your establishment. If I could give zero stars, I would."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-04-05,3,"It was very good, it was pizza, it had cheese and sauce. I put it in my mouth and then i felt good, 10/10 recommend for people who don't want to starve to death."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-03-15,3,"This place is okay, but I personally wasn't a huge fan of the pizza / crust / texture. I do love it's location in Gotham West and the fact that the market overall has filtered water and nice bathrooms. That said it's reasonable pricing and passable pizza if you're in the area and hungry!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-03-09,4,"4.5 stars. I loved the almost focaccia-like dough of this pizza spot in the Gotham West food hall. I tried two slices - the pepperoni and the special, which had meatballs and onions. Both were great, with tons of flavor and (on the pepperoni) not too oily. They had a good ratio of toppings to cheese, and the crust was thick and buttery. 

My only complaint is that they don't have very good take out packaging. It's just paper plates in a paper bag. I got my slices to go, and even though they heated them up for me, by the time I did the 10 minute walk to my destination, they were cold.  They still tasted good, but I think they would have been better warm. Maybe a cardboard box would be better, if they could find the right size?

Regardless, definitely worth a try if you're craving pizza and already in the area!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-02-27,4,Corner Slice is located on the North Side of Gotham Market. Its a small counter space. The pizza is good. The dough is less dense then most pizza and more like a Foccica. The price ia also reasonable ranging from $3.75 to 4.75
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-02-14,5,"Perfect amount of pizza for a hotel room delivery. Two half pies for four people and still had leftovers. First time having white pizza and am definitely a fan, especially with meatballs."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-02-06,3,"I'm wondering how four slices adds up to ""half a sheet."" The pizza was good, but not worth $5 a slice ($17 for pepperoni topping plus tax and 15% tip for delivery person was over $20). By no one's standard is 8 medium sized pieces a whole sheet of pizza."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2020-01-19,5,"Ordered the plain cheese for the first time on seamless, and wow was it incredible. So flavorful and perfectly cooked. Sauce and cheese ratio was on point. Will definitely be trying their other pies. Yes it's pricey, but it is absolutely worth it!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-12-31,5,"Grandma, white and cheese slice. What an unassuming spot for unbelievable pizza. I didn't plan on eating all three but couldn't stop myself. Can't wait to go back."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-12-20,4,"3.5 stars

Seems a bit overpriced for a slice of pizza (2 slices came out to $9.25) but I guess they can do that because it's pretty good. The dough is nice and airy and the tomato is fresh and flavorful. The special slice I got with fennel was super flavorful and delicious - to my surprise I liked it even more than the tomato. Unfortunately they like to make the crust super crunchy here, which isn't my cup of tea. But the toppings are delicious."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-12-04,4,"Airy, crispy crust that is thick, but not heavy.
Delicious, savory sauce and just the right amount of cheese.
This place is located inside a cafeteria like place with a bunch of other little restaurants. A welcome respite from the cold New York streets.
Try it if you are looking for amazing pizza that is not your usual NY slice."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-11-06,5,"This is really the only good restaurant in Gotham Market. Don't waste your time with the others. The tomatoes are stupid good here. I personally think this is the best pizza in midtown if not the whole island. Perfect crunch and ask for the Calabrian chilies, they take it to a whole 'nother level. It's so hard to find a decent italian sandwich in Midtown. The one here had amazing bread and a thick amount of tasty meat. Plus, throwing on those chilies made it so great. They even have homemade root beer here. So happy to live within walking distance of this great place."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-10-25,1,Ordered delivery. They delivered it to the wrong apartment. I had to chase down the delivery man who had to retrieve the pizza and then give it to me. When I got it..the sauce and cheese for the most part had slid off     I don't usually write reviews but this was unacceptable experience.
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-10-19,5,"Recently ordered delivery of the mozzarella, pepper sub sandwich. Bread was fantastic and so was all the other ingredients. Have ordered pizza in the past and it has been great as well. 5 star place."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-10-14,4,"I used to say that I was perfectly satisfied with the thin crust slice but I have to say Corner changes that. Their pizza is like sinking your teeth into the most perfect focaccia that houses only the finest and best balance of ingredients. Both slices I've tried have been beyond what I have expected--a chance encounter is Gotham Market ended up being a match made in heaven. My only lament is that they got me hooked and don't deliver to the east side!! But, respect for the fact that they likely do not want to deliver a cold pizza. Also, their slices could be slightly cheaper--I never want to get just one but with a drink it adds up. If they were just a -little- less costly I'd be sure to pick at least two. Regardless, it was a totally rewarding experience and I'm back in every time I find myself in Midtown West."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-10-02,5,"Really really enjoyed the one with the Calabrian chillies. Their base is outstanding and really soaks up the sauce. I wish they so had a similar gluten free base too.
And I wish they would open a branch in the San Francisco east bay!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-08-10,4,"Really good Sicilian style pizza, with fresh, flavorful combinations of ingredients and a thick but airy crust. The whole pizzas are a pretty good deal and can feed 3 pretty hungry people. I've ordered a variety of their pizzas and all have been very good.

The whole pizzas tend to be a little soggy in the middle though, but heating them up in a toaster over/air fryer makes them perfect.

They have a clam white pizza that is excellent but sadly seems to be seasonal. 

I usually order take out from here once or twice a month. I'm not sure this is a destination pizza place,  but the bottom line is that this is really nice Sicilian pizza for the area at a reasonable price."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-07-30,5,"Ate here last week.  My son got two pepperoni slices and said they were good.  I got one slice of the white, which was pretty good, and one slice of the cheese, which was fantastic.  The tomatoes are the real star.  They were so savory.  I don't know what they do to them, but it's fantastic."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-07-29,4,"The cheese Sicilian showed promise with its bright tomato sauce. The basil flavor really came out well, and the crust was light and fluffy with a crunch on the edges. The cheese was very subtle. This isn't necessarily bad because putting too much cheese would have inundated the fresh colors of the tomato. The edge crust wasn't dry at all and was seasoned well with garlic. This was definitely an above-average square. For $3.50, you do get a filling meal."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-07-03,4,"I got the pepperoni Sicilian slice.

good pizza.

nice crust."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-06-29,4,"Underrated pizza place. Cheap, quick. tasty."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-06-14,2,"I really wanted to like the pizza here as the pizza pictures looked so good on yelp but I would have to agree with the other yelp reviewers that the pizza looks better than it taste. For me, I think it was the crust that seemed a bit cardboard tasting and texture felt like that too. Ultimately, especially with NY pizza, the crust is so important and unfortunately, with all the options in the city, I don't think it would be our first choice to come back to order pizza from."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-06-13,3,"Sopressata, special, and mushroom slices called to me. I appreciated the customer service but this  Sicilian style just didn't hit it like the ones I've had before. 

I'm saddened that it has to be that way but the toughness of the dough took away the hope I had when I laid eyes on the pie."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-05-30,4,I got a cheese slice. It was delicious! The tomato sauce was so fresh tasting. I also got a kickass macciato.
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-05-24,4,Rating the regular slice which was better then the sausage one.. crispy crust throughout. Little bit oily . Heavy basil flavor. Sauce and cheese where both pretty damn good. I was impressed I thought thos place was gonna suck by the looks of this place but It didn't... at all.
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-04-29,2,"Looked soo good but ended up being so subpar. Dough was spongey & not at all palatable. 
So many pizza joints in NYC that I don't think i'll give this place another chance."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-04-21,4,"Was visiting my friend in Midtown West by 11th Ave and she recommended we check out this slice shop inside a food hall. And behold, it was Corner slice!!

Pretty solid slice and very filling. The food hall is adorable and have a few happy hour options so great to pair your pizza with."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-04-03,5,Pizza is excellent has amazing taste and a really good crust. Service is very nice and friendly. And the price is good
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-03-29,4,"So was at the Midtown ferry and was really craving that New York City slice of pizza, since I was heading over into New Jersey I quickly looked up the closest spot to grab some slices. This place is in walking distance from the midtown ferry (10 min walk). 
Now here comes the actual review, I ordered a total of slices,; 2 sopressata, 1 white and 1 special which I believe was topped with some beef and onion. FYI I shared these with someone else as I wouldn't be able to eat all of these by myself. 
All slices were pretty good, I wish the sopressata had a little bit more pepperoni and maybe a little bit of a thicker cut. The dough is really crispy and if you like it that way, you'll love this pizza! If you're looking for a little bit more dough you might be a little bit disappointed."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-03-17,4,"One of the better slices in the city. The plain slice sings, fragrant bright sauce and heady, crackly crust, milky mozzarella. All of it comes together nicely, and it's one of those slices with variety - this bite a little saucy, this one cheesy, it's all fantastic."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-03-13,5,"Best square slice joint in town, hands down! I've tried them all, this is the one. It is pricey compared to some, but you can taste the high quality ingredients. Try it, you'll be convinced"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-03-13,5,"Awesome pizza!! We ordered a whole cheese. I was expecting it to be a heavy Sicilian dough, but it was crispy, light and sooo good! Loved the fresh basil. Quite possibly the best pizza that I have ever eaten. The staff was super friendly as well."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-02-24,4,"Great slices. The sauce on the cheese slice was spectacular. The soppresata was also great. I'd pass on the sun dried tomato sausage and the clams one next time. We came close to closing, and the pizza quality was better than expected, so that was a nice.

Minor complaint is it was almost too light and airy (it's still a really, really good slice). 

Minor (but really major complaint) is the entire market only sells Pepsi products. How am I supposed to properly enjoy my pizza without a proper coke?"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-02-12,5,"Finding another good pizza spot in NY never gets old. This place is different and delicious enough to add to my pizza recommendation. In contrast to the typical thin slice pizza, you get a lighter, fluffier pizza with slight additions to traditional flavors. They add a lot of herbs to the pizza, and you can really taste it with each bite. My only complaint is that it's definitely pricey for what it is, and the line went by really slowly."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-01-17,5,"Excellent pizza, toss up between this and Patsy's Pizza in Spanish Harlem as being the best slice in Manhattan. Corner slice is Sicilian style while Patsys are thin brick oven. Corner slice uses fresh ingredients and you can see the staff through the window on 45 street prepare the pies. It basic slice is excellent deal and their special topping slices ranges from about 4-5 dollars.  Well worth it. You may actually be better off buying a whole pie. 
Take them up on their root beer special. Located in the Gotham Market where there a nearly a dozen other eateries. I have been here countless times and I can't get past the pizza counter."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2019-01-04,3,"I wanted to love it, but I only liked it.

The buttery nature of the pizza kinda threw me off. It's very good if  that's what you're looking for, but to me it felt a bit heavy and even a touch dessert-y. So this would only be at most a once-in-a-while place for me."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-12-31,2,"Good crust, really nice tomato sauce. I wasn't into the white slice bc it wasn't juicy, really. The soppresata slice not much either, but I definitely appreciated the tomato sauce. I don't think it deserves the hype at all and shouldn't be considered a NY slice for tourists, but its an okay thing overall. I would come here again and knowingly pay too much for a hero just to try it. I don't think i will be totally satisfied with it bc $13 for a hero is too much. But it won't be crap. This place isn't crap.

Another time I came at 920 on a Thursday and they were out of breakfast sandwiches. Idk, im just disheartened that they don't actually make them... And then I had one. I don't like the flavors, the cheese is too weak and the peppers distract too much. Also, the eggs are the form that make you take a poop afterwards. I want to have pizza again here bc they have been given so much praise, but I really don't think it's that good. You are much better off going to Roadside on the other side of the market. Those sandwiches are killer.

It's just a little too much pretense for me here on the part of food media and it doesn't have much teeth anywhere."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-12-07,5,"Is it sacrilege that this is my favorite slice in the city right now?

Definitely not the traditional NY pie slice, these buttery, thick-yet-airy, Grandma style bundles of joy are absolutely phenomenal. It's worth noting that I've only ordered their ""cheese"" pizza (mozzarella, tomato sauce, basil, pecorino and grana) - the best way to tell how legit a pizza is! I've also had their Mozzarella and Peppers sandwich (roasted peppers, arugula, basil, and zesty vinaigrette on housemade ciabatta bread) - good+, but could use more hot peppers/zesty-ness to offset the natural blandness of the other ingredients. They also do freshly baked goods onsite, such as cinnamon rolls, brownies, and more."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-12-04,5,"Honestly, I think I might be quite thin were it not for Corner Slice. Whether grabbing a slice after work or entertaining out-of-town guests, this is my go-to for pizza in my neighborhood.  

The crusty is both perfectly crispy and chewy, and the toppings are always perfect. I usually go for a soppressata and whatever the special slice is. 

Consistent quality, service with a smile and friendly greeting, all within the lovely Gotham West Market - it can't be beat!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-11-23,5,"The pizza is some of the best I've had in my life. It's in a category of its own. The crust is par baked to make it simultaneously crispy and fluffy. We always go for the soppressata pie, which has the perfect portion of sauce, cheese and cured meat. The baked goods and coffee are great too. The olive oil and pistachio muffin is my go to in the mornings along with an ice-cold cold brew. In the evenings, their fudge brownie is a must have. This place has changed the pizza game."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-11-20,5,Pizza was great. I'm pretty sure I swallowed it whole. The Employees even better super friendly and clearly enjoy their jobs.
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-10-12,5,This is the best pizza I've ever had in NYC in my 30 years of living here. It's so damn good!
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-09-24,5,"Turns out that the Gotham Market not only has a fantastic pizza and draft root beer place in the Corner Slice, this is THE best place to watch live Sporting Events.....watched the World Cup Semi-finals (Croatia 2 - England 1) 

On top of the pizza pies Corner Slice puts out a mean Italian Sandwich.    Oh yeah, that goes down REAL good.    

For watching live sports on T. and great food, hit Corner Slice in Gotham Market."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-09-18,5,Best ny pizza. It was so tasty so i eat more then planned) Airy but cryspy dough just awesome. 5+++
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-08-30,1,"This was the first place I visited in Gotham Market, my first day living in the city. Sadly, it was a huge let down. The ""pizza"" is basically all bread and little toppings. I couldn't taste any sauce, the bread was hard as a brick, and on top of that, it was not warm. It wasn't cold exactly, but it wasn't fresh either. The people are nice for the most part, but the pizza is not worth the price at all."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-07-31,4,"I had the Sorpressata and I think it was a good price point at $4 for the slice. It was filling but at the same time, not overly heavy."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-07-21,5,"This place is one of those places where you eat one slice of pizza as dessert and after you eat one you think you need to eat one more because the slice is so good.

First time I had the meatball sub as well as the saprosta slice.  Not sure if I spelled it right but my Lord sweet baby Jesus does this slice scream good new York pizza.  A must visit for an amazing pizza.

5/5"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-07-12,4,"There's only 2 pizza places by my hotel in (my) walking distance. First, I tried Claudio's, which was disgusting. So today I tried corner slice. When I first looked at the pizza, I was about to leave. It wasn't an authentic New York pizza! But I didn't know where to go so I just tried a slice and I'm glad I did! It was really delicious! Yum"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-07-04,5,"DELICIOUS. It is not traditional triangle slice..It is light, it is airy, it is crunchy, it is tasty, it is so flippen good I may need to walk back over....

Who says pizza has to be heavy. Each option a winner. A famous east village pizza place opened a few years back on 9th Ave.. I was very excited... but it didn't compare to the east village location and have been twice in 6 years.

Corner Slice is the place for pizza in Mid Town West. I go no where else."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-06-23,5,"Wow. Just wow. The owners of this gem are truly talented. The pizza crust is beyond delicious and the various toppings are so rich and tasty. This is not your typical pizza joint. The meatballs are light and the sauce perfection. The biggest surprise was the sweets. Almond cookies, pistachio cake and more. Everything made on premises. This baker has the touch. Do not pass this place up!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-06-18,5,"44 years old and I just had the best slice of pizza in my lifetime.  I don't think I'll ever forget this experience (especially the crust).  

This is the kind of place that you feel good supporting.  I wish these guys the best."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-06-14,5,"Unique dough, like no other New York slice. Friendly service, nice price! Keeps me coming back again and again."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-06-04,5,"Tucked in the Gotham Market, Corner Slice offers a great Italian style pizza . I'm usually a picky person when it comes to my pizza. I like the basics. Cheese or Pepperoni only. I branched out and tried the White Pizza and a Soprasatta (sp?). I have not had a better pizza. Hands down.
This was by far the best thing I've ever tasted. And that's saying something cause I feel like I could eat pizza every day of my life. 

Do yourself a favor and check out this place if you're in the area. I know that when I'm ever back in NYC this will by my go-to Pizza stop."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-05-24,4,"This is good pizza, definitely a place to go purposely (unlike the name implies).  The crust is very good-it is tasty and greasy, but has a good texture to it. Very reasonably priced."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-05-15,4,"There was a place on the LES called Pizza Groupo, they were known for making a cracker crust. yeah... picture cardboard with cheese. Yucko.

Coming into the Gotham Market, I was expected to see Blue Bottle coffee. Nope, its now been replaced with Corner Slice. A pizza joint from the creators of Ivan Ramen. You'll see my review for Ivan Ramen, I liked the Ramen and the pizza did not disappoint. 

It's almost like a Roman pizza, very thin crust with a high crunchy factor. Both the sauce and cheese are of high quality. Mr Orkin, kuduos! You make a pretty good NY pizza. 

If your in the market, I highly recommend trying a slice from Corner Slice. Quality pizza that you would typically find at a corner pizza place in your neighborhood."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-05-13,3,"Oddly enough, the meatball sandwich was decent, but the pizza was not :/. It was super dry and lacking flavor. We got a regular pepperoni and the special pizza, both disappointing. The toppings were VERY minimal (ONE piece of sausage on an entire slice?!?) for the price. One slice legit was almost HALF dry bread and no toppings. The bread for the meatball sandwich was decent (not nearly as dry as the pizza), but the sandwich itself was small and mostly sauce with very little meat. For $25 for two slices of pizza and a small sandwich, we weren't full or satisfied. I'm not sure if the pizza had been sitting out all day or something, but If I'm going to pay $5+ for one small slice of pizza, it better at least be good!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-04-09,4,"The question asked, How does a Jewish guy master both Ramen and pizza? I get the nod to a superb pastrami bun, but this exquisite homage to F&B Spumoni's crust with finely selected toppings and just the right sweetness in the sauce. Reasonably priced and friendly served."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-03-10,4,"I tried this place at the Gotham west market on a hungry stormy evening.ever since., I always have a slice of their white pizza. The bread is soft, chewy kind of like sourdough. I give them 4 stars for that.Expensive!! 4.25$ for a slice which is small!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-03-06,4,Stopped by for a slice and was very pleased. The guy behind the counter was super friendly and courteous. The slice was yummy - not greasy and the ingredients tasted fresh. More a Roman pizza than a Neapolitan. The place was very clean with lots of places to sit. Plus lots of other food options in the food hall. Definitely will be back.
238,corner-slice-new-york,2018-02-19,4,A damn good slice of Sicilian style pizza. Crunch crust and a great sauce. The tomato pie is amazing. The cheese was what got it the 4 stars. The cheese is great too!!! Order a whole pie fresh and it would be a 5 star review
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-12-03,1,"Totally rude people here.  Pizza is good, but when they have stupid policies like, ""we cannot give Parmesan cheese or crushed peppers on the side with your delivery"", just makes you wonder"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-11-13,5,"This place has amazing and unique pizza. Never had a slice like this, where the crust is so crispy and flavorful that I wanted to finish every bite. I had bacon and onion pizza, the tomato sauce tasted fresh and went perfectly with the bacon. Another great addition to New York pizza scene."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-11-05,4,"Heard a lot about this new pizza-player on the block and glad I tried them out while at Gotham West. Since I wanted to sample some other vendors as well, I opted for a single slice (which range from $3-4.50) of the ""special"", which was fennel sausage, onions on a white pizza. Solid, 'grandma'-style pizza, and as other folks have already noted, the dough is delightful - great chew with a crisp exterior (Note: I did ask for the 'toasty' reheating of the slice; pro-tip). 

Great stuff, hope to try some more of their stuff - especially the soppressata!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-11-02,5,"Stop. Here. For. Pizza.  This place amazing.  Always fresh and hot pizza available whenever I'm there (which is probably too often).  The longest I've had to wait is about 5-7 minutes as they waited for a pizza to come out of the oven.

The sauce, cheese, and meats are of very good quality, and the oven is top notch (no soggy bottoms on this pizza).  Always a friendly staff, and plenty of seating right near by (it's in the back corner, so usually a few more open seats around).

Not to be missed at Gotham!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-10-13,5,So amazingly good. The dough is almost like focaccia and the cheese is deliciously nutty. I'm just sad I only got one after making the trek to the west side.
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-10-10,3,"The white pizza was amazing, but very garlicky. The porchetta sandwich was way too salty and oily. I was expecting a chunk of pork shoulder, but it was thinly sliced. The meatballs were not very flavorful."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-10-08,4,"I was really torn between 4 and 5 here -- I really, really liked this place. I got three slices -- tomato, cheese, and soppressata. I liked but didn't love the tomato slice (it was really garlicy, which I could see other people loving more than I did), but the other two were fantastic. Really sturdy, crispy crust, a sweeter tomato sauce (which I love), great structural integrity -- one of the better square slices I've had in a while. Not terribly priced, either. I'll definitely be back."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-09-27,4,The best time to get their pizza is between 1pm - 3pm for some reason each time I've had a slice from there at this time it's tasted the BEST. Strange right? Love their food. I also go there for cappuccino sometimes and I also like their muffins and cookies. Pretty good !
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-09-25,2,"Pulled the bait and switch on me.  Ordered the piping hot sopressata slice in the display case, the lady slipped an old, cold slice from behind the counter in the oven when I wasn't looking.  It happened twice.  Too bad they don't want you tasting the fresh slices."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-09-20,5,"HOLY SH!T , NEW YORK GOT ITS PIZZA BACK!!!IM THE PICKIEST PIZZA CRITIC IN THE NEW YORK AREA. YOU GOTTA TRY THIS PLACE. I JUST CURSED OUT MY MOTHER..... You won't find a better pizza !!! Compare for yourself. Sorry Lombardies , artichoke, totonnos. L&Beware!!!

Came back !!! Had to see if it was a fluke. It isn't !! Consistently rediculous !!!! Amazing !!! Stella's groove would be rocked ! I'm not yelling !! I'm screaming !! This is the best f&@cking pizza !!! Sorry All"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-09-11,4,"So so sad because my sis and I got here too early and they didn't have their regular menu up and running. All they had were their breakfast items which were very good! 

Pistachio muffin: 5/5 - my sis is a huge pistachio fan and I have to admit, it was very good. Packed with that pistachio flavor that a lot of pastries lack when cooking with this nut. 
Sticky cinnamon roll: 4/5 - typical sticky bun. Not too sticky which was nice. 
Salami cheese puff but no salami: 3/5 - all cheese and no salami. I was super sad. Not sure if it was mislabeled but I swear there was no salami in sight. The bread and cheese were still good but definitely disappointed. 

Can't wait to return here and try more food!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-08-17,1,"Close your eyes and let me feed this to you. You would never guess it's pizza. I just don't get it. Plenty of great slice places in the other boroughs, but nothing in Manhattan. This tastes like something your mother threw together in the toaster oven. If you want to pay 3 bucks for that, have at it."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-08-05,3,It wasn't terrible but didn't live up to the hype. Just ok. Staff was nice which is always a plus but didn't dig the pizza. Happy I tried it but won't do it again. So recommend you checking it out
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-07-03,4,"This was a pleasant surprise for us tourists- we wanted to experience the famous NY pizza, but we were pooped from a day of walking and didn't want to go far from our ferry station. So we found this little food court through Yelp; a great move on our part! Corner Slice sells their pizza as the name indicates: by the slice, each slice $4. It's a little pricey, but in New York, it's not a bad deal, and the slices are on the bigger side. They have a bunch of pizzas premade for customers wanting to buy by the slice, but if you're interested in feeding a large group (probably 6+ people) go ahead and order a whole pizza, it'll save you money (unless you need the instant gratification that by-the-slice brings). As a food court, there are other places to check out as well, such as ice cream and dessert, and even a water station."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-06-23,5,Needed something quick and easy while my hubby and i were sitting in standstill lincoln tunnel traffic. The pizza was AMAZING and the staff was quick when i explained my situation even making sure he could easily eat it while in the car. No more hangry hubby even though were still stuck in traffic and he couldnt stop talking about how good the pizza was :) We will definitely be back!
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-06-13,4,"Great latte!

A family of 4 tourists walk into Gotham West Market and each and every one gets the food they want to eat at 4 different counters.  Everyone is happy.

I'm craving coffee. I walk over to Corner Slice and although am tempted by the pastries and pizza, I order latte.  Beautiful foam art and delicious latte!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-06-04,5,"Just finishing up our coffee and breakfast sandwiches! I love my malted cold brew with condensed milk!

I also had the egg, pepper, mozzarella, and ham sandwich which was delightfully spicy! Another friend had the cinnamon pinwheel and liked it.

My friends also had a macchiato (low acidity which is good) and mocha which they enjoyed. 

It is at the end of the market by the restrooms.

This is the way to do a delicious food court!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-06-02,5,"I cannot say enough good things about Corner Slice! Delicious pizza, great service, wonderful ingredients and fantastic coffee and desserts! I have enjoyed several meals here this week, and I will probably get coffee here tomorrow. It is that good. Lots of great places to eat in Gotham Market, but this is one of the best!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-06-01,5,"Can't go wrong here! Fresh, thin crust pizza by the slice served swiftly and with a smile. All for a price that keeps your pocket book plenty full of Benjamin's!

Seriously Yelper's, if your in Hells Kitchen, you can't go wrong with this little ""slice of heaven""."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-05-31,4,"The pizza at Corner Slice is solid. It's not the best pizza in the area, but a welcomed addition to the Gotham West Market. The pepperoni square pizza is probably the way to go at this joint."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-05-28,4,"The pizza here is very good. The crust is tasty and has a good chewy yet crisp texture. It's not absurdly expensive, but I'd say the pizza is pricier than other pizza by the slice places nearby."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-05-28,4,"Decent pizza. I liked the crust better than the toppings, which I almost never say. I had a slice of the margherita. Decent service."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-05-16,4,Pizza is a great option in Gotham Market. Really great crispy crust.  The ingredients are fresh and flavorful.  Robust tomatoes and seasoning.  Premium cheese.  And they have Gino's ices!   My fiancé went to go pick it up on a rainy day and they forgot to put the pizza in but made up for it with 2 extra slices and some of their cookies.  The cookies were fresh and not too sweet or heavy. I've been waiting for this in Hells Kitchen. Now I just need them to deliver and they'll get 5 stars.
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-05-14,4,"It's a bit pricey for some pizza but it is pretty tasty. 

The crust is light and flakey and packs a punch.

I ordered once of each slice and both red and white slices were good"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-05-12,5,"Great new addition to the Gotham West Market, exactly what I had been hoping and wishing for!

Pizza always makes everything better and Corner a Slice does not disappoint in any way. We have been coming here since the day it opened and it really has been consistently good. 

Menu options are solid, in addition to pizza, they've got a great salad with high quality ingredients, hot heros and even baked goods. Root beer is also a must! So good!

Love watching the guys prepare all the ingredients through the outside window, everything always looks so fresh and clean!

This is the easiest in and out option in the market and always hits the spot! Pizza is on point, crispy crust, delicious sauce! Yum! Five stars!!"
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-05-05,4,"To me, classic New York pizza is more fun when it comes in square slices. They're all about the squares here! The crispy, yet soft tomato pie is amazing! It's got a nice balance of crushed tomato, garlic (gotta have garlic), basil and oregano. I was pretty impressed! The cheese pie didn't wow me as much--just could be my own taste buds."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-05-04,1,"Have to revise my review. Originally had a positive experience but just had the worst. The cashier was awful and horrendous - I'm talking about you lady who works on Thursday nights. I hope she gets fired. I asked if the Gotham west (apartment) discounts were still valid and she replied with a snarky comment ""oh if you didn't have the discount then you wouldn't buy any pizza!?"". Ouch lady.

Still hungry, we got one of each of the bottom slices. I was curious about the pizza type on the top right which looked like to me regular tomato pizza with rhyme or rosemary on top. She said it was with anchovies and I couldn't see any of it so to make sure I didn't hear wrong I asked her again. She proceeded to tell me in again a snarky way "" I made it myself so know it has anchovies.""

Sure the pizza here is good but if they're hiring people like this - I don't ever want to eat here again."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-04-27,5,Best pizza I've had in New York!! Definitely come check this place out. We had the white cheese pizza and the Margherita pizza and both were really good. I'll be back soon!
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-04-25,4,Great crust and the ratio of crust to sauce to cheese is great.  I have to say its a little pricey i got a slice of the pepperoni and a crush soda which was $7.  But minus the price the pizza is good and the fact that they put the slice in The oven to reheat.  Wish there was coke though instead of pepsi.
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-04-25,3,"Don't believe the hype about this place. Nothing they are doing here is at all revolutionary. They are cooking scilian style slices on top of focaccia. For some bites, this pizza was really satisfying, however this pizza was plagued by being too oily. It was impossible to pick this slice up because it was so oily. And the tomato slice I received was overpowered by the taste of garlic. I'm glad Gotham West Market finally has its pizza place, but I will not be returning."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-04-16,5,"Initially,  I found this place on Yelp, soon after I couldn't stop daydreaming about a meatball sandwich. It was a long and stressful search in the spur of the moment. I couldn't think of anywhere that specializes in meatball subs, so after searching and searching, I came across a meatball sandwich in the photo gallery. It was Corner Slice at Gotham Market! At first, I was a bit disappointed because it didn't specifically specialize in meatballs, but it had to suffice since it was in the proximity of where I was. I opted for the white pizza and the sub and boy, am I glad that I got both the white pizza and meatball sandwich. I had the pizza first and the first taste of it was gravitating.

My initial thought was that this pizza had to be one of the best slices I had. Each bite makes you yearn for more and once you finish the entire slice, you cannot help but to want another one. The meatball sandwich was good too, the bread itself was really soft. One thing that I wished was that there were more meatballs and possibly bigger? I think the entire sandwich only had 4 tiny meatballs and most of it was bread. If the bread wasn't so soft and wasn't a normal hero bread, I think I wouldve been really disappointed. I ended up going back for a second slice. If anyone is in the area or wants some good pizza, this is a good place to go with many other options within Gotham Market."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-04-15,5,"The crispy, crunchy crust makes each bite more enjoyable than the last. Being my first time here, I asked which is the most popular and I was not disappointed. 
I had a pie of their tomato which is similar to a margarita pizza. Not too much cheese, nice tomato sauce and some basil. 
If I'm in the area again, I'm gonna grab me a slice again."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-04-12,4,"(4.5 stars) Delicious but definitely pricey. A great add to the Gotham West Market. 

Disclaimer: This pizza isn't your typical NY pizza slice. But it has a nice crunchy crust (focaccia-type bread) which is what I'm always looking for in a good slice. If you're looking for extra crunch get the corner or side slices. 

Get the sopressata, tomato, and I think it was a garlic/basil slice."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-04-03,4,"Solid pizza and great dough from Ivan Orkin. I love Gotham west and was excited to try this pizza joint. Good toppings. They're still expanding menu. The meatballs were nice as well. Good spot for a different type of slice, more artisanal flour makes for an awesome dough."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-04-01,5,"This. Place. Is. Awesome. 

It is the best pizza in the area by magnitudes. I've been skipping breakfast to grab slices in the late morning, and, I'm a happier person because of it. I've also solved very difficult mathematical equations after consuming 2 or more tomato slices. 

It's like I want them to succeed but I also don't want a line so I'm conflicted a bit. But they deserve the credit. Best in the area by far."
238,corner-slice-new-york,2017-03-30,4,"Yummy, but pricey.  Expected for the gotham market however.  I do appreciate a pizza spot in there.  I think it fits very well!  I'd like to see more of a variety of slices in the future.  It's cool though.  Looks like an old fashioned pizza joint, lol.  

I won't go regularly, since it is a little expensive, but an occasional treat is worth it lol.

Also, not a traditional slice! More on the gourmet side...well-suited for the gotham market lol."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2020-07-18,5,"I enjoyed the experience at this restaurant. Food is actually really good and the drinks here are great as well. 

The scenic view is phenomenal. I've only been here during the afternoon but I can imagine during the sunset. The view is breathtaking. 

Only issue is I feel like the drinks are a bit overpriced granted it is located in the upper west side so I definitely believe it can just be for the location. 

Despite of that one minor issue, I still would highly recommend coming to this place."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2020-07-17,4,"What a relaxing scenery! Grab a bite here with some friends and enjoy the view. The cafe has the tables spread out for social distancing and have the workers clean down the seats and tables after you leave. The food was good and had flavor. I ordered the ToGo Burger and Old Bay fries, the burger was good but the fries could have had much more flavor. P.S instead of ordering the ole bag fries get the regular fries. I totally recommend this spot if you haven't been out during quarantine."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2020-07-11,3,"Had the burger and fries and it was good. Tables were 6 ft apart and hard to come by. We took our food to the dusty, dry lawn to eat since all the benches were taken. Standing around waiting for the food under the HOT sun was painful. They need to add extra umbrellas or stretch out a heavy duty fabric to cover the ppl while they wait for their food. For this reason, I wouldn't go there often."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2020-07-09,5,"Oh what a place!! Where do I start!?!? I'll start with the social distance etc, since that's so important in these tough times. I felt so safe coming here, the tables are well over 6 feet apart (unlike alot of spots in the city) and the staff members are all masked up and ready to go! Next, the food. The Lobster Roll. Cold and perfectly dressed tender lobster salad on a toasty, buttery roll. You really can't go wrong. For dessert I had the cinnamon ice cream sandwich, which was to die for! And now most importantly, the service. Ian at the front was amazing. I took all of his suggestions and couldn't be more pleased. Next up was Anthony (sorry, I always ask people their names), who was incredibly friendly and made nice conversation while I waited for my delicious blueberry lemonade. Finally, the chef Dillon. He was super friendly, double checked to make sure my allergies were taking care of and that I had everything I needed to enjoy my meal. On my way out I went to thank the staff here, and they seemed genuinely happy that I enjoyed my experience. Dillon, Ian and Anthony are all absolute rockstars. I shall return!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2020-07-06,1,"The girl who took my order specifically asked if I wanted sauerkraut with the hot dog in my order, which included other items.  Then they decided to not give it to me.  I hope this was not in retaliation for not paying tip, which would be really sad.  (This is restaurant with no servers - you pay and pick up your food at the counter - so I have no tip). Either way, nothing worse than not getting what you paid for."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2020-06-15,5,"LOVE THIS SPOT! Especially during the summer, (pre-covid) you were able to sit outside and enjoy the view of the water. Hands down, the burger is usually my go-to and their Old bay fries. YUMMM. They also sell alcohol too!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2020-01-01,4,"Lovely spot to stop at during the warmer months. They are closed over the winter so check before going! 

The food is a-ok and the alcohol is just fine, but the view adds so much to the entire experience."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-10-12,4,"Maybe 5 stars depending on what you're expecting. Everything is top notch except cocktails, but the convenience by bike off the greenway makes this a frequent stop and watering hole. Fish tacos in the summer are awesome, and the recent ginger carrot soup special is mind blowing. The spaghetti squash bowl is a solid choice, but more of a cold salad with apples and grapes. Refreshing, but not what I expected, but great nonetheless."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-10-07,4,"I don't go here for the food typically as it's not the best, but you can't beat the views. The desserts are OK and the old bay fries are food, but the rest tastes a bit frozen. There's also a really solid selection of beers, including some great local options. It's a must-visit summer hangout."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-09-23,5,"This is such a hidden gem! I would have never found out about this place without Yelp. It is a little confusing to get to since the map location is slightly off. You have to walk through the tunnel in the park to get under the highway. Then you see the lights from the restaurant. 

It was so nice to sit on the water and enjoy dinner and drinks. The scenery is gorgeous. I had chicken fingers and corn on the cob with fries and a pina colada. Delicious! It is also really nice because you order at a counter and get a buzzer. This makes it more casual and you are free to sit as long as you want. After we ate, we walked down the pier and came back for dessert. They have a few options and they all looked delicious! I had a ice cream cookie sandwich and my friend had the brownie sundae. Both were great! I had a great time here and totally recommend coming! I will be back!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-09-08,5,"This is my favorite spot during the summer & is one of the things I miss most about living on the UWS. 

If you are a french fry fan this place is a must. Make sure to order with bay seasoning. Also big thumbs up for their frozen margs."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-08-24,4,"Great for a quick bite to eat on a weekend stroll. Can recommend the quinoa salad and the blueberry lemonade, both delicious!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-08-24,3,"Its pub grub....we ordered cheese plate and fries and some other basic fare

Drinks are ok...not too good....not too bad
Views are great. Go for a drink and the view. We enjoyed our drink with a view of the water and then spent time walking by the river. Its a good spot for breezy days"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-08-22,5,"Please don't tell any more people about this gem. Awesome staff. Sunsets, omg, if there food was better we would need 6 stars!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-08-20,5,Love the atmosphere.  Perfect for a romantic date or a relaxing time with friends.  The food is freshly made and delicious.  Will definitely come back.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-08-17,5,I thoroughly enjoy this place as a treat for a bite in between bike riding along the water.  I always get the cheeseburger and I like it with blue cheese.  It comes with fries which are also very tasty.  It's nice to people watch and sit by the water enjoying your food.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-08-11,4,"Out of all the spots to grab a beer in Riverside Park (Ellington, Boat Basin), this is by far the best! Huge outdoor patio with plenty of places to shit (in the shade!). Great for bringing the littles ones, too. Food is unexpectedly good... still bar food, but good. I've tried the shrimp skewers (4/5), watermelon (3/5), wings (4/5), and hot dogs (4/5). If you're looking for a place to enjoy a sunny afternoon, this is your spot!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-08-09,5,"great summer evening dinner with the family! food was really good...fish tacos, veggie burger, fries were all great.  caesar was okay but met expectations..pass on dessert.  got the brownie ice cream for my niece's birthday and it was hard as a rock.  as an 8 year old it didn't matter but the adults passed on it."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-08-09,5,"Love it here. Sits on the water and view of NJ. Great sunsets and v peaceful and relaxing. 

Old bay fries are nostalgic.

The veggies burger w cheese and avo is delicious and worth it.

Tasty selection of wine.

Currently 5:30 in Aug and plenty of seating."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-08-06,2,"Nice view, close to water, after a trek to get there. But for such a casual place -- tables strewn about, self-service ordering and picking up of food; plastic utensils; thin paper napkins (not even delivered to table); upon leaving, required to bus your own stuff (and astonishingly, no separation of waste into paper and plastic -- aren't they required by law or garbage collectors to put into distinct recycling bags?); and meals in slight portions, this place charges the same as a restaurant that would have substantial plates and table service:  too much!!  My 'watermelon' beverage had a couple of inches of pureed melon and was filled in front of me with seltzer.  Too diluted!  The format and the pricing are contrary -- two different levels of experience."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-08-03,4,"Stroller accessible. High chairs available.  The Old Bay French Fries are truly great. The drinks, not the best but will do.
Not so crowded which is a good thing for an outdoor place on a summer weekend!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-07-16,5,Great burger and fries. Uses Pat Lafrieda beef so you know it's quality. Love the location after bike riding to grab a food and a beer. Outside seating has nice views.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-07-15,5,"This is by far the best place to eat and enjoy the water on the west side! Especially if you have kids! We eat here often and I just celebrated my birthday here with a couple of families last night. After scavenging tables a few workers came by and added some tables to the two we found to make us more comfortable! Also our kids were getting restless and I asked one of the workers if they had crayons and a kids menu to color. He said they didn't but 5 mins later he came out with printer paper, pens, and highlighters! My kids were ecstatic! And we were thankful!

Oh the food and drinks are on point. My favorite on a hot day are the wings with a frozen pina colada!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-07-14,4,"This is a great place in Manhattan. 
Probably the Best place in Manhattan where you can grab beer, chat with your friend and enjoy the sun shine by the river.

This place is near hudson river where you can enjoy the sunshine by the river. The burger is also good here. 

Will come again in the future."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-07-14,3,"You come here for the view not the food. I had a lobster roll, overpriced and not very good, and a chicken burger which was okay. The view was nice and it was fun to watch the boats go by."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-07-14,3,"Great view by the water. Looks like they have good liquors on hand for a relaxing time by the river or people watching. Food tastes like school cafeteria quality. Go for the view, drinks, and convenience.  Pigeons were looking to steal food by stalking the diners."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-07-06,3,"Normally love this place however they recently started adding a MANDATORY tip. There aren't even servers here - you stand on line to order, are given a buzzer, and then have to go pick your food up at the counter when it's ready. The establishment should just pay their employees more instead of relying on customer tips."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-07-03,4,"This place is overall really good! I had the Pier i Burger which was very good. The fries that came along with it were seasoned very well; they were some of the  best fries I've had. The venue is really nice and relaxing with a great view of the Hudson. You can hear the road noise that's above somewhat, but that's easy to tune out."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-06-10,3,"While I love the location of the Pier I Cafe and the food is good, I do not like the new system where they automatically charge you a tip at checkout. It should be a customer's choice whether or not to tip, especially since this cafe is pick-up only. There is no waiter service."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-06-08,5,"Love this place! Easy going, great food and drinks, best place to spend a beautiful day in the park. Service is quick and easy, very friendly staff."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-06-08,1,"The most untasteful burguer and waited 45 mins for it... not coming back. 
I took them 45 mins to make it taste  like air and they give you a alarm for nothing"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-06-07,4,"very nice ambience, very relaxing. I ate the bbq dogs, they tasted well. go there with your book and enjoy the sun."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-05-25,5,"Best views, friendly venue, and just so relaxing! This is definitely my favorite spot in NYC! Awesome date spot too.

As for food, I recommend the burgers and salads. French fries are great too.  The tall pitcher of white sangria is a must (they don't offer red sangria)."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-05-18,5,"Awesome spot! Today was one of those perfect Summer like days in Spring with low humidity and plenty of sun. This place feels like heaven on earth. The drinks and food are reasonably priced and delicious. It is an order at the counter setting with patio style tables overlooking the Hudson. We had the pitcher of white blueberry mango sangria, a lobster roll, grilled shrimp with mixed greens, tomato, quinoa, edamame, and calamari. It was great! The calamari could have been fresher but it all far exceeded my expectations. I will absolutely be back!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-05-12,5,I will definitely pick Pier I Cafe over Boat Basin in 2019.  Very friendly staff.  Better food and more fairly priced.  Not as loud as other places.  Dog friendly.  Great sunset views.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2019-04-07,2,"Although it shows as open on Google and Yelp, it was closed at 4:30 PM on a Sunday. Shame because I wanted to try the food here."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-12-28,3,"The location is fantastic. You order food at the register and get a buzzer to pick it up when it is ready. The service was very fast, even on a very busy Sunday night (10 minutes from order to pickup).  The food was decent but the location on the water makes up for it. The salad has too much dressing (dripping in oil), and the burgers are all well done regardless of how you order them.  The burger patties appear to be frozen pre-made patties, and taste that way too.  The crab cake was decent, but they are skimpy on the amount of crab (doesn't measure up to a good Maryland crab cake).  Come here for the atmosphere and view, go elsewhere for a great meal."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-11-08,3,"Good neighborhood diner. Good standard dishes. Salads, sandwiches, burgers. Friendly atmosphere and good service. Very good spot for lunch in the neighborhood. A few celebrities eat there."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-10-03,5,"Awesome place to hang out by the water. I like it, because it's casual and a good place to take break while running or biking."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-09-19,5,I love this cafe! They're only open during the summer but it's a great spot for light drinking or hangout with friends. They have an awesome view and love their fries.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-09-16,4,"Nice laid back place to get a drink or a bite to eat on the banks of the Hudson River. It's the self serve, counter service type where you get a buzzer that goes off when your food is ready to be picked up. They have a decent drink selection: 4-5 beers on tap, wines and cocktails, and really good white wine sangria! Food here is not too bad either, I've had the burger and it was fairly good. Seems like they have a decent seafood selection as well, so will probably give that a shot the next time I'm here.

This is definitely a very kid-and-pet friendly spot, so expect to see your fair share of dogs and strollers. Overall a good place with reasonably priced fare, ideal to spend a relaxed summer afternoon or early evening."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-09-12,3,"I would give this place a solid 3.5 stars. The scenery being right on the Hudson River is beautiful and the food is amazing. The only problems I had were being outside the birds were flying around constantly as I ate and the kitchen despite being told it opens at 11:30, it opened more about 11:45. I would be willing to give this place another shot because the workers were all so friendly as well!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-09-04,5,"Wow, Pier I will always have a special place in my heart!

Pier I came back strong this year, after disappointing last year! 

It, now, has an updated menu with delicious and affordable items! You can finally add bacon to your burgers! The drink menu is also on a new level!

Please find a way of keeping this business open ALL YEAR LONG! :("
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-08-29,1,"I came here while on vacation and was covering a large portion of my family's tab. I get a random $40.29 charge additional to my tab that I notice after leaving. I called for a simple explanation thinking maybe it's a holding charge which would be weird but let's see. They said it was because of the first round of drinks I ordered when starting the tab but then when I added that up that was $52.00 so that's not right. Eric the manager or owner just looked at me and came up with the response ""well that always happens I can assure you it will be taken off"" with an ugly smile at me like I'm an idiot. He told me to call him when the pending goes away to say he was right. All I wanted was a solid reason behind this charge. The poor server was getting so flustered trying to explain the charge but they really had no solid answer for me but to just wait. Obviously there was a mistake for that specific amount.

So I wait a few days right and guess what :) the $40 charge came off, but now I have an additional charge of my whole original tab!!!!!! What a mess. Sorry Eric I didn't call you, I called my bank to file a claim and remove that. Disgusting I will never go back and I warn all of you not to ever talk to crooked Eric."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-08-28,4,This is a nice outdoor cafe where you can bring your dogs and have a drink :) pitchers of sangria are good as well as a few appetizers. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area. Great place to relax by the water.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-08-23,4,The chicken sandwich was really good. The atmosphere was calm and cool for a afternoon drink
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-08-16,4,"The food itself is okay but it's a great place to stop by while biking on the west side, grab some food and drink and watch the sunset."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-08-10,5,"Cool place to enjoy summer nights just by the river. Amazing view. Food is standard, good fried potatoes. Kind service and you won't smell street garbage!! (Which is great for outside seating)"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-07-31,4,"Cute place by the water, great drinks and good.  I had the steak & it was perfect! My friend had the shrimp skewers and we both left nothing on the plate!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-07-22,4,"I stumbled on this gem on a bikeride, and it seems that it's somewhat hidden and forgotten about, as everyone I have mentioned it to has never heard of it. Since finding it a few weeks ago, I have come back twice and I am obsessed. 

It's off the bike path of the Hudson, overlooking a long pier that often has live music, outdoor movies and exercise classes. It is remote from the city, has amazing views, and is the perfect outdoor bar/restaurant. The drinks are very reasonable priced and delicious. The fish tacos were okay, and the fries were okay. Neither were as impressive as I wanted, but I think this is a place you go for the views and drinks. Gsters chicken sandwich and salad however was delicious, so I think it's just a matter of trying different food options."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-07-20,4,The burger was yummy! It hit all the right gingery spots. The fries were good too just not like the burger. Service was was quick despite the crowd.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-07-13,4,Beautiful outside seating by the water and great food! If you just want to lay back chill and feel a nice breeze while you eat with a nice view . Deff check it out
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-07-11,5,"Thanks to Yelp for connecting me with this gem as it's easily become one of my favs for the summertime. If you're looking to get away from a lot of the city bars, noise, and same ole city things, this is your place. 

I like to come here to enjoy a nice drink, view and their food. Nothing on the money will break the bank as this is merely a chill spot to come to relax, hang out and enjoy. Good for both large groups and smaller groups, I would recommend Pier i Cafe on a nice day/night."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-07-07,3,"Great atmosphere but average food. The views by the pier are well worth the experience all together, especially on a summer evening the sunset was amazing. You order at the counter and pick up your food at the window, and so it is a little overpriced considering there is no table service anything. The lobster roll was good but not noteworthy, but we loved the thin crispy fries! The calamari and ceasar salad were also both good but not the best I've ever had. There were also a lot of birds picking at leftover food on the tables which created a lot of mess, and there aren't really any employees who walk around to clean or maintain the area. Would be nicer if they either 1) made it more of a sit down restaurant with service, or 2) made it more like open public tables where you can bring your own food and drinks if you want"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-06-26,3,"Been coming here 2-3 times a week ever since the weather got warmer. food is average, price is high. however, the scenery is great and very convenient.

Although this place is self-service, neither the diners clean-up after themselves nor it is obvious where they should throw away the trashes. management might want to consider making sure tables get clean up way more frequently.

also, since this is self-service, do ensure that the DEFAULT for credit card payment is other than requiring tips."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-06-24,3,"The outdoor cafe on 70th Street and Riverside Park South is conveniently open every day weather permitted. They even have a bike rack for those of us on two wheels. You'll be able to see it from a distance, glowing bright green. Plenty of tables and chairs, abundantly adorned in greenery. A nice place to make a rest stop and get a cold beverage or so I thought. I tried the skinny piña and boy do they need to train their bar tenders. I had to go back and adjust it several times to no avail. I left it mostly untouched. On the menu they boasts high quality ingredients. I'm not holding my breath. Regardless the food and drinks it's a lovely informal setting on the pier where one can relax and observe the activity on the river."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-06-17,4,Good place to relax and hang out in the Riverside Park. Food is decent. Liked the crispy calamari a lot.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-06-10,5,"I think this outdoor cafe is nice. 
2nd time we stop in here for lunch after hiking down from on the west side from the George Washington Bridge. 
Great burgers, real good and lean beef. 
Salads great to. For Manhattan prices not to bad. Full bar but we are more interested in the coffee. 
Free water for all. I really like that touch. 
Real friendly staff as well. 
We will go back again anytime 

Hugs"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-06-07,3,"Tucked away on the Upper West Side is Pier i Cafe, a nearly hidden outdoor cafe that sits on the pier looking out to New Jersey and beautiful sunsets. I first came to this venue about a year ago with some friends. Just this evening I came here and the experience was the same as last year except I got to experience some pretty solid customer service!

First of all, if you come here and aren't a local you need to enter on W68th Street and Riverside Blvd. If you are a local, you can walk from wherever it is you're coming from along Hudson River Park. Either way, this place may be tucked away behind towering condominiums and underneath the West Side Highway but it's easy to spot all of the lime green umbrellas. 

At the entrance, it's usually best if you hop on line and review one of their menus kept on the side of the wall. By the time it's your turn, you can place your order. The menu isn't too bad, there's a small assortment of small plates, mains, desserts and even some side dishes and alcoholic beverages. If you're having food, whether it be a lobster roll, salad or hamburger, you receive a little buzzer that goes nuts when it's time for you to pick up your food at the counter. Since this is an outside and uber casual venue, your best bet is to divide and conquer with friends meaning one of you saves a table and the other picks up the food. Which by the way isn't anything outstanding but it gets the job done! Want a frozé and lobster roll or beer and ice cream sandwich? Done. 

In terms of customer service, you won't get much except a smile and cashiers who get you in and out the line quickly. Tonight one of them accidentally charged me for a pitcher of beer ($28) instead of one glass ($7). I raised this issue to the manager who was very apologetic and polite and promptly took back my card to give me back the difference (which he said would be given to me in cash but they somehow made the card work). As the night went on, the same manager went around the tables and tidied everything up and worked alongside the servers who were floating around to clear up tables. Last year I don't remember staff being so attentive to customers or the space itself so it's nice to see the turnaround. Even if you're not crazy about the food, I'd say this place is more about the views of the river and sunset along that allows you to escape from the day-to-day bustle of the city. Will definitely come back another time!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-05-23,1,"This is a review about the service because it was tremendously appalling - I hope management can correct this system because it is extremely disheartening. We were very eager to try Pier I Cafe. 

We came here for dinner and a drink. We both went up to the front of house to determine what to get, I then go to snag a seat while my partner orders. He's carded after ordering the beer (this isn't the issue)... the issue is begins here: once he gives his NY STATE ID, he is called to question - ""What's your name?"" ""What's your address"" assuming it's fake.

1. if your job is to serve alcohol in the city, you should know what a real New York state ID looks like. 
2. It's ONLY his job to check if we are of age and if the ID is real. We don't have to disclose any personal information. But if you want to invade our privacy, it's right there on the card so don't be smart. 

But my partner goes along with it only to have his time wasted and get denied (the first of five times) for this reason: in case I (who had sat down) was underage. But we give them the benefit of the doubt. I give my ID to my partner since I had to watch my bike - he is denied a second time for this reason: I need to be there.

So we both get up, at this point stressed. The charades continued because after handing him my card myself, I was fact checked AS WELL with the same dumb question.... We were denied a third time BC I don't want to play this game anymore. You refuse to serve us because I won't tell you info that is right in front of you? Cmon bud. I am of age BUT the fact that the only thing that can prove whether it's real is my 'memorization skills' and not his skills as someone who's job includes checking IDs is pretty outrageous. Plus I have a NJ ID... Pier I Cafe is right on the Hudson River AKA he literally faces NJ at work! He SHOULD ALSO know what this ID looks like since it's probably the second most common one given!!  

This part is the worst: he refused to give me my card back. I had to demand for it multiple times!! How on earth is that an OK way to treat people? 

Not at any point did he consult for a second opinion from a more knowledgeable coworker. This was 100% a power trip.

I brought up my frustration. It became so achingly clear that he just didn't want to serve us; he sees hundreds of IDs at this job and he must have known in reality. A coworker came by, took one glance at the ID, and knew for certain. But even after being told that, he denied us a fourth time - still putting his foot down and insisting to badger us with more questions.

By then we were so appalled that we didn'twant to support this type of treatment by staying, we just wanted out. We told this man all of our points above and he said, assuming just so he could have the final word, that he would refuse to serve us for ""being irate"". The fifth time, but at this point we were as good as gone.

Look, we've previously worked in the service industry, including serving alcohol. We know rules are rules but there was no acceptable reason as to why were treated like that. ""Just doing your job"" is not the excuse - get someone who is actually capable if you are unsure. We've been carded at numerous places and never had this happen. We turned to walk away while this guy shooed us saying ""go catch the next train home""."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-05-20,2,the new bkfst menu was disappointing.  the burrito seemed to have been made from a mix and tasted like wet dog food.  the french toast came as sticks and was like bad airport food.  coffee was ok and of course the view is nice but they need to get on AM point.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-05-16,3,"I enjoy this café. I live pretty much behind it so it is very convenient. They're a bit pricey for what it is, but I'm sure they have to survive somehow in that location.  I've gone a couple times.  They have a very good cucumber margarita. 
However, my last experience there left a bad taste in my mouth. When ordering the girl was new and being trained.  She ended up missing some of the order and I noticed when going to pick up the food from the window. The first girl tried to argue with me, the second one pulled the receipt and said our missing calamari wasn't on the order. That's fine, I know for a fact I said calamari, no need for the staff to be rude about it. They didn't try to remedy the situation at all, but told me the kitchen was still open if I wanted to order something else. I feel like every other restaurant in the entire world would have offered to comp the calamari, seeing how we had already spent around 60$, it's not like I was trying to get something for free."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-05-15,1,"It's early in the ""season"" May 15, 2018, but so far, this is the absolute worst place in NYC. The setting is lovely, which should have been warning enough. The design of the space is excellent, another warning. The people working there pleasant. The grilled chicken sandwich I attempted to eat was the worst chicken sandwich, for that moment, on the planet. Not ""cooked to order"", unless cooking means drying out the chicken, drying out the ""brioche bun"" and then putting it on a paper plate and surrounding it with surprisingly edible greens drenched in a sugar based dressing - the only thing worth eating. The chicken was impossible to cut with the plastic knife available. The bun disintegrated when picked up. The chicken is too thick to pre-cook it more than 30 minutes before serving it. There is no excuse for the bun, unless it's a subtle hint to feed the seagulls. Probably best to stick with bottled beer, packaged chips and maybe a hot dog if you bring your own bun."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-05-12,5,"This is the perfect place to dine when there's nice weather. The view of the river is so calming and people watching is fun too. I really enjoyed the menu, I had the grilled chicken sandwich, which I pretty much scoffed down in one bite. It was tender, juicy, delicious  Favorite part about spring is the cocktails and here the special was jalapeño watermelon margarita. It's a dangerous drink because it's so good you could drink 3 and not realize it's all going to your head. Lastly I finished my meal with an espresso chocolate chip ice cream sandwich!! Omg it was delightful !!!! I'd highly recommended this place for families, co-workers, or just a group of friends. It's a chill place and the food is good. - @agirlsgottaeatt"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2018-04-28,4,Great outdoor spot. The food is great and well priced. Highly recommend on a nice day.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-11-30,4,"I have frequented this cafe on many midsummer afternoons and nights. During the lunch/afternoon hours the lines are relatively long, so be prepared for a 5-10 minute wait to order, and then another solid 15-20 minutes for your food to arrive, obviously depending on what you ordered. 

To state the obvious, you pay a premium for the location, and for the convenience of the cafe in the heart of a bustling part of Riverside park. But I have always been surprised that the quality of the food is still pretty decent. Maybe it is because I had low expectations for a seemingly small shop on the river, but we are always satisfied with our orders. The menu itself is smartly designed to be simple and offer 1-2 solid options for vegetarians, pescatarians, omnivores, etc. That allows them to serve pretty good food.

As mentioned in other reviews, the fries are a solid bet. Hummus as well is good for starters. We've gotten the burgers as well which are ok, but good to pair with a bucket of beers on a summer day. The area is beautiful and the pier juts out into the Hudson to get great views of Jersey and the Riverside high rises.

The few negatives are the congested space, great difficulty finding seats on weekends, and sometimes having to guard your fries from the pigeons!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-10-28,4,So sad this is the last day of the season! We love the setting. My favorite it the fries. The Waldorf Salad on the summer menu is excellent. I wish the burger had more taste. The meat is blah.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-10-18,5,"Simple and unfussy, they serve great salads with a wonderful ambiance. Great spot for a date, the view is amazing at night!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-10-14,5,"Love this place! Their grapefruit rose wine is served in a plastic cup, but so what? You are sitting on a NYC pier overlooking the Hudson River on the UWS enjoying the picture perfect sunset  life couldn't get any better.  Pier i Cafe is a family-friendly, casual outdoor riverfront cafe that we sadly only rediscovered recently and heard they are closing soon (since their business is seasonal).  Wish I had spent more of my summer nights sipping grapefruit rose and enjoying their delicious Grilled Shrimp Skewers appetizer ($14). For the price, the appetizer seemed like a very generous-sized dinner salad (for me!) with 9 jumbo shrimp on top of a bed of tasty Vietnamese style rice noodles and mixed greens.  And the neighborly accordion player added to the ambiance!  Wish it was summer in the city a little longer!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-09-03,3,A date brought me here to then pressure me to get alcohol.  I got some rose I didn't finish while he got this beverage that wasn't what he imagined it to be.  We sat down and talked some; by then it was pitch black outside so we didn't get a great water view but the staff was friendly enough and it was convenient enough to where we were walking.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-08-29,2,"Quality is down this year, and definitely not worth the price. My friends and I arrived on a Sunday at 3:00 p.m. (not a peak hour). Blueberry lemonade was wonderful as always. But the veggie burgers were seriously undercooked and totally tasteless. We believe that frozen patties may have been microwaved, when they should have been browned on the grill like a hamburger. And my friend said the apples in her Waldorf salad were mealy. Such a disappointment - I had always enjoyed the cafe in previous years."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-08-21,5,Growing up in NYC this has always been me and my dads spot since I was about 5. I love the scenery. The cheeseburger is amazing but the prices have increased a lot but it's worth It.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-08-20,2,"I went to this place and order the humus and a burger.  I have to say the humus was terrible - I would just call it ""mashed chickpeas"" which is what it is.  Has no flavor - nothing to do with humus. They either never had humus, don't know how to make it or don't care.  On top of that  they add orange marmalade which doesn't add anything to it. - Very odd combination!!! The chips are fried - a plain pita would be better. 

The burger was ok - 

This is a nice place to sit but the staff really should go around and ask people who are sleeping on the tables to move - it is a restaurant and not someone private living room.  people sit there with no drinks or food for hours."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-08-06,3,"I visited this place mid way during my long run training for the Chicago Marathon.  The Blueberry Lemonade they have is superb.  The Pier i Burger leaves more to be desired - the meat was fine, but the whole package was just lacking jjuices/moisture.  I had to constantly keep on drinking water.  I did like their fries though - it was sprinkled w/ salt and some kind of herb - basil?  

Anyway, this place isn't bad but it's not phenomenal/out of this world."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-08-03,4,"Great place to have diner!
With a wonderful sunset view!
Great menu,  also végé, and good food. 
Friendly and relaxed atmosfere. 
We'll be back!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-07-31,1,"Quick service but nothing special. Don't expect custom orders. They can handle chicken and burgers, and bottled cold drinks (duh). DO NOT GET THE PHILLY CHEESESTEAK. There was so little meat, it was a RIPOFF!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-07-21,3,"Great location and beautiful scenery by the water. But that's all. The food is extremely disappointing, highly priced and there is no service, as this is really a take out place. You order your food, you pick it up at the counter and you find a table to sit down. Paper plates and plastic cuttlefish complete the set. I had the bracketed salmon and my wife had the swordfish tacos. The salmon was tasteless, you could not really taste the blackened fish.The tacos had raisins...which we found rather strange. Extremely disappointing. We also had the humus, I never had humus before covered under a kind of jam. Accompanied by oily chips. I hated it, my wife liked it. Overall, what a pity. To have such a unique spot and really downgrade it with terrible food and no service. I hope sometime another operator can put there a better restaurant. Will I go again? Yes, probably, because of the location."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-07-16,4,"I love this place for lunch/dinner in the summertime.  A great place to meet up with friends, to impress a date, or to show off the city to guests from out of town.  My only criticisms are that it's always packed, and also that there are aggressive french-fry-grabbing birds all around (watch your back). 

My favorites are the Blackened Salmon, and the Pier I Burger, but I don't think you can really go wrong. Grilled skirt steak was good, but slightly over-seasoned. Sangria is crisp and refreshing, there's a great selection of summery beer/wine, and the frozen rose specialty cocktail is a lot stronger than it looks."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-07-10,1,Where do i start.... their rose/wine is served in plastic cups... so... fancy....
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-07-09,5,"Always a great time when I come to this area. Live music, food and drinks are good. Definitely a must come during the summer time."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-07-08,3,"**more like 3 1/2 stars**

Despite the fact that I've lived in the neighborhood for almost 9 years, I've only been here twice. The first time was a weekday afternoon so it was pretty dead.  The second time was a Sunday almost close to dusk. WAY busier that time! I came here on the recommendation of several friends. Most of them said: you MUST have the burger.  I'm a medium
Rare kind of girl with my burgs, but I ordered medium (some places have it mooing and I wanted to try it safe first). And it was very dry. Also the fries were touted as ""old bay"" but they're really truffle. I like truffle fries, don't get me wrong. But when a gal wants old bay, you best not disappoint. 

The second time, hubs got the burger. He, too, had the same complaint. We've had great experiences with the Pat Lafrieda burger joints around but this was one disappointing.

This is a great place to get a pitcher of sangria or a frozen drink and people watch. The pier itself had live music on Sunday nights. The ""just OK"" burger experience wasn't enough to keep me away. I'll definitely be back. But maybe not at a busy or dead time. I'm kinda like Goldilocks -  looking for a time that's ""just right!"""
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-07-07,4,"More than anything, you come here for the ambiance and scenery. The food was OKAY but not bad either. My boyfriend and I split the lobster roll and grilled shrimp, I was definitely satisfied and happy with the sunset views!!!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-07-02,4,"Great view of the Hudson! Pricey, but expected for the view and area. Good place to relax outside!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-06-27,4,The view is what makes this place great. Food is okay and drinks are reasonably priced. But being right by the pier is pretty awesome.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-06-26,1,"Amazing how people encourage bad food by giving 5-star ratings for the location!

The food is pretty horrendous. 

Swordfish tacos - badly cooked fish, some fruit compote WITH raisins (wtf?) in it.
Chicken wings - just everything wrong with them. Wrongly cooked, wrong sauce, veggies do not look fresh. Blue cheese dressing was fresh. I think.
Calamari - I do recommend as they were fresh...BUT they were coated in something weird.
Muffin was bad. Did not finish.

Amazing how people encourage bad food by giving 5-star ratings for the location!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-06-26,4,"With the limited outdoor eating venues in NYC, the bar is pretty low. I'll forgive a lot in a meal for a great view and fresh air.  In this case however, no forgiveness is needed. Pier i Cafe is positions itself as a casual dining space with great views. It delivers well on both counts."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-06-21,4,"Did you know there is a bike and running path that goes all the way up the west side of Manhattan along the river?   

Riverside Park is long, and miles away from the blurry rush of buildings, rats, cabs, and halal stands. 

Along the path, which I take regularly from the 130s down to TriBeCa, there is a variety of activities from sunning on the lawn, reading a book on a bench, to basketball courts and tennis courts.

Ideally, there are two pitstops uptown, the Boat Basin at 79th, and Pier 1 cafe at 70th.
Both feel a bit tangential to the park experience, and perhaps even city sponsored, with Boat Basin more of a place to drink beer with a grown up frat party atmosphere, to Pier 1 cafe a more family friendly parkside food court.

The table area is fairly new with outdoor lawn chair seating that you might find at a water park.  The sea air is fresh, a mix of salty wind and hot garbage.

Order at the counter from a simple menu of things like quinoa salad $12, fries $5, calamari and burgers.  The food looked a step above your average amusement/ ball park.  

At 2pm on a Tuesday in June the place felt surprisingly relaxing, even tho the hum of cars overhead from the freeway is non stop, and the random scavenger request from a pigeon is inevitable.

The view of New Jersey isn't exactly breathtaking, but it is a nicer outdoor patio with trees and plants. 

Access to the cafe is right off the path, so coming from the street will require a good walk with plenty of stairs.

My cup of coffee was $2 and while not super strong, wasn't weak, and had decent flavor."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-05-28,4,Cute cafe with green lawn chairs facing the water. Breakfast consists of 6 items ranging from sandwiches to fresh fruit and granola. Got here at 8am so perhaps the brunch is not out yet. Coffee was good at a reasonable price $3 and the view is quite nice. There's a long walkway into the river beyond the restaurant or you can continue on the Hudson River greenway. Great place to stop for a break before heading onwards.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-05-27,2,Ordered a steak with greens and fries..got a plate with greens and cold fries.. everything is old bay flavored so the taste gets old quick.. over priced for no conceivable reason
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-05-24,3,"Always crowded. Food and drinks not good and overpriced. 

But it's by the river front with great space. Great for a short break from biking at the riverside bike lane, or for family with children to hang out."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-05-17,4,"Came after work on a very hot spring day. They were quite a few people there, but ample seating allowed for me to unwind after work fairly quietly. I ordered the Lobster roll. It came out super fast! It was a bit wet with lobster seasoning which made the bun a bit soggy but lobster was well tasty and fries were great as well. Will definitely return!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-05-16,2,"I used to be a big fan of the Pier i Cafe, particularly around lunch time. The tables are public, and you can bring your own stuff or purchase meals/snacks/drinks from the Cafe. 

But lately, they've taken to blasting music. They didn't do that in the past. It ruins the daytime vibe. It's a staff choice, evidently. I asked them to turn it off, but they wouldn't. Since it's technically a public space, I wonder if one can complain to the Parks Department."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-05-09,4,Started coming this year and pleasantly surprised by beer list and burger.  Was a dedicated boat basin fan for years but this has now become my go to spot for beers after a bike ride on the west side highway.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-04-29,4,So it just opened back up and the season just started. It was relatively easy to get a table to have a late lunch with my cousin.  Drinks were served in plastic cups and the french fries could've been fresher but otherwise it was a nice place to be on the water with a great breeze. The white sangria was as tasty as the burger and lobster roll. Looking forward to coming back. Might want to bring a travel mug for your water as it is self-serve.
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-04-17,4,"Lovely view, food is typical of a burger and fries joint. Will return as the weather improves.. great for date nights."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2017-02-14,4,This Place Is Wonderful In The Summer For Drinks Only! The Food Is Trash Sever In Paper Cups And Paper Bags??? (Really) That's Not My Style. But The Drink Are Amazing And Looking Over The River. Lovely If You Must Eat Have French Fries Served In Paper Plate. Take That Tree Down The Own Must Say Everyday? Lol
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2016-11-30,4,"You can see why they're packed April - September
Food is great and can't beat the location"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2016-11-27,4,"I love Pier i Cafe! 

They have an interesting rotation of beers on tap and in the summer there's nothing more relaxing than splitting a pitcher of their blueberry lemonade and watching the view from the outdoor seating area.

Food is surprisingly delicious for ""pier food"" - they have old bay fries and a pretty juicy burger to boot. Salads are interesting and pretty satisfying too! 

Dog friendly since it's outside. Incredibly difficult to find seating since everyone enjoys sitting here for long periods of time while leisurely sipping their beverages (and sometimes just sitting there with no food - rude). 

Enjoy in the summer!"
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2016-10-27,4,"This place is adorable! It's a building with lots of outdoor seating. The views are great, especially during sundown. It's is fairly quiet, surrounded by a little park with people running or biking down the pier. I felt releif coming here to get a small snack and a tea on a warm day and some work done. Nice break from the busy city."
239,pier-i-cafe-new-york,2016-10-07,5,"I passed this place, while working and liked its location. I took my wife here one night and we had a nice romantic dinner by the river. The view was great and so was the food."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2020-07-04,1,"Ok I live a block away and I absolutely despise this place and wish something better would take its place. I haven't tried the coffee so I can't speak to its quality but in terms of their food, AWFUL. The pastries are all dry and just meh in general. So lacking in quality compared to any similar, decent French bakery. We also tried a jar of their jam once and it was disgusting, might have been moldy when we first opened it. I didn't even think it was possible to mess up jam, but here we are. To anyone considering eating here, Maison Kayser is on the same block and is a DELICIOUS AND AMAZING French bakery with more options and far better quality. Go to that establishment instead, for the love of God."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2020-06-14,5,"The croissants are as close as I can get to France. They have quality items and it's a great local place to pick up breakfast, lunch, or dessert."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2020-04-15,5,"Writing this during corona virus times due to nostalgia for the good ole days.

I spent 5 days in NYC in late February on my own to explore and eat. I went on a mission to find THE BEST almond croissant because I just adore them. From my research I hit up Via Quadronno, Ceci-Cela, Bouchon, and Mille-Feuille.

Mille-Feuille was heads and tails above the rest - though they were all good with the exception of Bouchon's which was very disappointing. I think I got a stale one because it was just a crisp. It broke apart to the touch.

Mille-Feuille's was delightful, hearty sized, perfectly crispy on the outside and lovingly soft on the inside. The paste was fragrantly balanced, not too sweet, not bland. I got a nice sized latte with it and my winter morning was set. 

I loved it so much I got two to go when I flew home and they held up! 

Love this place and love NYC. Hope this place will be there for future trips. Stay safe NYC."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2020-03-09,3,"I fully admit that I probably ordered wrong here ... the cakes and pastries looked delicious but ever since my trio to Paris last summer, I have been searching for the perfect croissant. Much like outside NYC, good luck finding an authentic bagel or slice pizza, I have not found anywhere that comes close. There is a BIG difference between a 3 star (good) and 5 star (amazing) croissant. Sadly, I did not find what I was looking for here.

I was going straight up purist here with a plain croissant, which might have been my downfall. Perhaps the almond or chocolate croissant would be the way to go. I was rather shocked that butter or jelly was not an option and instead you are just expected to eat a plain pastry. If you put this croissant and a Wholefoods croissant next to each other in a taste test, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The texture was dry-ish and the crust was not crisp. The whole thing was kind of dense, flexible and roll-like. I came at 1 p.m.

The two things I hated about this place was the layout and the staff. The layout was terrible with the cash register where people order and wait only feet from the door. The group of people waiting to order or pick up makes it impossible to see what's in the case and browse. When I got to the register, rather than snaking in and out and around people to try to see into the display case, I just looked at the small case next to the register and bought a croissant. Would I have bought a whole box of French pastry if I could comfortably browse and order from the case obscured by a pick up/order line? Probably.

The staff was also as prickly as a cactus. No warmth ... grumpy acting. I may have asked about some of their specialties or suggestions but the girl behind the counter treated me with all the warmth of someone who just punched her kitten. The staff behind the counter looked dour and miserable and didn't talk. Heads down ... silent ... brooding. Must be a real salt mine there. I guess this was the closest to Paris this place comes.

The decor is sort of sterile and hip. I thought it looked like someplace you'd see in an airport. The storefront is very unassuming and small and being so close to NYU, I am guessing the tiny space is designed to keep college students from grabbing a coffee and spending a few hours on their laptop taking up space. I get that. Still ... maybe place the ordering counter in the back with a line that goes the length of the pastry case so people can browse the offerings?

I intend to return and try a few different items and will update my review at that point. So far all I've tried is a good croissant. I hope to try a great macaroon or a fantastic pastry my next time through."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2020-03-07,5,"Nice bakery with a big variety of option (both sweet and savory). There is not a lot of space though, tables are designed to be ""for two"". 

I was recommended a galette with almond paste, which is apparently a ""limited edition"". But honestly, it was a hard choice because everything looked yummy. Chai latte was very good too. (I just hope it's home made)

I recommend this place, check it out."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2020-03-05,5,The croissants and everything else are amazing here! You can't go wrong. Better than most of the bakeries in paris. And so cute inside!
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2020-02-06,1,"Horrible service, mediocre food. Been there several times. Finally had enough of
the snooty servers who never get the order right. Ordered lemon cake, got carrot...ordered 2 lemon cakes, for 2
Croissants. Decaf only served for breakfast...WTF?  To top it off, the worst tasting quiche I've ever tasted. Bad bad taste."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2020-01-21,1,"The store downtown is poorly aerated and smells musty damp and moldy turned my stomach the moment i entered , i came because of the good reviews but how on earth can anyone not notice the foul musty flavor from the store in the pastries !???  each and every item i bought ( croissants almond croissant  quiche , all were contaminated by the   stale smell ... too bad because i sincerely believe that the quality is outstanding but put any top quality pastry that contains fat in a moist damp moldy place and it will pick up the smell ... organic chemistry/ patisserie 101 
Plus it is not good for the employees in there to breathe this air ..."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2020-01-11,2,"It looks nice but if you arrive seven minutes before closing, the oh-so-busy barrista shakes her head and says ""sorry."" Ok local business: adios."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-11-28,5,I gotta give it up for the Mille Feuille.  It was smooth vanilla bean creamy goodness between crisp layers of pastry beautifully packaged for take out.  So happy to have this cute little French pastry shop on the UWS.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-11-26,4,"Excellent pastries, both savory and sweet, but definitely a takeaway spot -- it's very cramped and tough to get a table, and most tables accommodate only 2. Come for the food, not the ambiance."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-10-11,4,"This is an excellent bakery. I had some of the best macarons I've had. The coffee was average, but I would definitely recommend coming here for a good pastry."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-09-27,4,Nice cafe and friendly staff. The almond/chocolate croissants and the Mille feuille(napoleons) were delicious. Coffee could be better.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-09-21,5,"Excellent bakery shop, friendly staff, 14 seats indoor, 6 seats outdoors, within Belleclaire Hotel with separate entrance"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-09-10,4,"I was just walking along and happened to see this bakery across the street. It looked so quaint so I decided to cross the street and take a look. They had a blackboard with the special coffee and a Croissant for $5.50, which seemed like a good deal. However I opted for A Slice of Veggie Quiche and an Iced Latte. I found a cozy little corner in the back. The Latte was very good. I was told they did not have flavors to add but they did have Vanilla Sugar, which I added. The Quiche was tasty. I had a nice little break and now had the energy to continue my walk. It is a nice place. It looks very clean. It is a little small but I was there at an off time. Has a few Tables outside."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-09-09,4,Such a cute little bakery - great for pictures! Love the neon sign. I had a praline macaron and an iced coffee. Both were excellent. Excited to come back and try more of the baked goods.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-08-30,5,"Lemme tell you, the last time I visited Manhattan I didn't have the greatest customer service experiences. Today I was on the hunt for some green tea while staying nearby with relatives. Not only does this place have a variety of tea options, their baked goods looked so yummy I had to try. First bite and I'm a very happy camper. The service is the reason I'm giving it five stars. If I could give ten stars for service I would. It's always lovely as a tourist when you're not made to feel like one."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-08-26,5,"What a delightful little cafe!

I scored a fabulous sea of 6 macarons for $10, although I think it's a seasonal special? 
Anyway, it felt like a trip in time back to Paris when I visited a couple of years ago. 

The macaron was chewy, rich, and dark. Even with the filling I feel they've added real espresso which is impressive. A little bit of TLC goes a long way, as it wins loyalty in customers. I am very much coming back.

I had espresso, raspberry, and passion fruit chocolate. I think the passion fruit was a little stale bc it was older, but that's okay!"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-08-10,4,"I came here with my straight-out-of-France professor. How much more harmonious does it get? If she approves, I approve! There were samples of L'Exotique cake, which was divine. I took two, and they even insisted I take more. The service was super sweet and quick. 

I ordered an almond milk latte, my go-to, and it wasn't amazing coffee, but it was smooth and consistent. For $5.50, you get a large cup (non-dairy milk extra .50). I love the outdoor seating and the girly vibe. It's a cute place for any type of casual meeting. I wouldn't come here to work on your laptop, but I would come to do some reading.

Definitely looking into their baking classes! I adore things like that and the reviews make it sound like it'd be fun."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-08-06,5,"If you are looking for a delicious Mille-Feuille or a French pastry you don't have to travel all the way to Paris to get it!! Yes, search no more; Mille-Feuille Bakery Cafe on 2175 Broadway New York NY 10036 has you fully covered! 
This immaculate, shiny clean place is the best kept secret for all your sweets and healthy sandwiches with variety of ingredients. 
One thing that attracted my attention is the cleanliness of the place despite its location in a very busy Broadway Street. 
I was amazed at how the staff members remembered almost the names of each of their clients? They must be their repeat customers! They greeted every one of them with a smile on this very busy Thursday morning! The store was packed but the service was so fast that everyone was served happily; some enjoyed the outdoor seating in a fresh morning breeze!
The size of their selection of coffees, teas and juices were very generous! I certainly enjoyed my large mug of Hot chocolate accompanied with a crusty warm Croissant!!
By the way the prices on the items I have purchased were extremely affordable compared to similar stores in the area. 
I highly recommend this place if you miss your French pastries or if you just want to experience a taste of a French Bakery in America!"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-08-04,5,"Went to Mille-Feuille a month ago when I was in the city and am finally getting around to reviewing it now (oops)... but!!! I had a great experience there. The pastries all looked delicious, but the blueberry danish I chose was spectacular . I also ordered an iced mocha to go with it and the coffee had an amazing taste (the chocolate definitely helped too )! And an added bonus was the cuteness of the bakery! I would definitely recommend Mille-Feuille to anyone visiting or anyone searching for a new regular spot"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-08-03,5,Mille-Feuille is absolutely amazing. it is the cutest little cafe and in such a nice peaceful are. their coffee is great and their pasteurized are amazing (highly suggest their almond croissant). honestly you just need to go and see (and taste) for yourself.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-07-27,5,"Wow this is exactly what I've been needing. Great coffee and pastries at a reasonable price. I paid $10 for an almond croissant, plain croissant, and iced coffee. The plain croissant was lovely and after having tried so many mediocre croissants at coffee shops in the neighborhood I was very glad to have this one. Buttery, flakey, fresh, slight crunch but still soft. It wasn't overly heavy and didn't make me feel like garbage after. Almond croissant was sweet, if a little mushy, but a great complement to the strong and properly brewed iced coffee (they serve la Colombe). Overall this is exactly what I expect from a bakery cafe, tasty coffee and no bullshit when it comes to the pastries."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-07-13,5,"Awesome bakery, coffee and atmosphere. Indoor and some outdoor seating w/ a super welcoming staff. If you're missing a croissant and coffee break in France, this is your spot!"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-06-27,2,"I have eaten here before. Good coffee and bakery items.  However today one of the Male staff members, who seemed to be preoccupied with the cash register did even acknowledge our presence. After standing at the counter for approximately 45 seconds we walked out. I am sure we would have spent some serious cash here. This rook place on 06/27/2019 in the morning."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-06-17,5,"-The almond croissant was fantastic - definitely top 2 or 3 I've had in NYC. My wife (who is even more obsessed about these things) thinks it may be tops. 
-They were out of the French doughnuts already by about 11 AM which was disappointing given how much other people liked them.
-It's a crowded little shop especially when your typical UWS lady sprawls out at the table right in front of the counter so there's hardly room for two people to pass by."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-06-08,1,"Very disappointed. Got a sampling and wouldn't return to have any of them. Mille feuille had burnt pastry layers and bland filling. Almond croissant was dry. Choquettes dry. I didn't go early in morning and perhaps the case, open to the room air, does little to preserve freshness. However, I went there with friends for a treat and we all got duds."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-06-08,3,"This is a little cafe attached to a hotel. There's coffee, tea, and an assortment of both sweet and savory treats. Seating is limited and not especially comfy, but there seem to be some regulars who set up with a newspaper or book and stay awhile. 

Coffee is $3 for a small (also $3 for a single espresso), which seems to be increasingly common in downtown hip coffee shops but still rattles me. On the bright side, if you get it to stay it's served in a mug, which I appreciate.

Pastries are half off at the end of the day, but not sandwiches or quiche slices, which is perplexing. Do they serve those the next day? Or just hope that there will be a sudden influx of hungry people right before closing? Unclear."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-06-05,5,"I had the best coffee IN MY LIFE today in that place! Now it's my spot forever! Amazing and super friendly staff which love what they are doing, that's why coffee is so tasty! Thank you! And see you tomorrow!"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-05-23,5,"This is the best French bakery ever.
The croissants are absolutely delicious and the rest of the pastries too. I tried the pear one and also a regular chocolate cookie with walnuts that was out of this world. The coffee deserves a special mention. It is made diligently and it is perfect. I tried the cappuccino. One of the best ever. The place is clean and nicely decorated. The people who works there are nice too."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-05-03,4,"I stopped by Mille-Feuille Bakery yesterday while in the area, and they did not disappoint. I had an almond cappuccino and the last praline macaron, and without exaggeration, it was one of the best I've ever had. What was also pleasing to me was the customer service I received from the employees there. Both employees were friendly, attentive and professional. I loved everything about this place except for the limited seating, but fortunately, I was able to find a seat outside on a bench. I will assume that paying seven dollars and change is about standard for a cappuccino and a macaron, so in that case, it was worth it. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of their baked goodies. Thanks for making my morning Mille-Feuille Bakery!​"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-04-30,5,I am staying at the Hotel Belleclaire and this pastry shop is next door. I ordered a ham and cheese croissant and a latte. Wonderful start to my morning.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-04-27,5,"I travel to New York City once or twice a year. I usually stay on the Upper West Side, perfect for daily trips to Mille-Feuille. This time I'm staying in Chelsea, but that did not stop me from trekking uptown for my Almond Croissant. So worth it! There are a lot of pastries in this city...and I've tried them. These are the best! And the coffee is good too...and the service, always kind and helpful."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-04-23,5,"Tonight I had the best chocolate chocolate cookie I have even tasted, truly amazing with such high quality ingredients. I can't wait to try my pear tart in the morning. I will be back next week to enjoy a baguette for sure. The women working there was so very lovely. You must try."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-03-23,3,Oh men I really wanted to love this place because the staff is so so fantastic and it's so close to my home but my almond croissant was overly sweet. I never had such a sweet dough in an almond croissant. I might stop by again and try another thing anyway.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-03-09,5,"This review's sole purpose is to tell you about the yummy cake that the Royal Chocolate Mousse is. Ever since I have tasted this mouth watering dessert I have been dreaming about it day in and day out. The cake itself melts in your mouth and his little bits of praline scattered throughout that are little pops of crunchiness. 

I have tried the slice itself, but the whole cake size, priced at $18.00 is a great option to share. You also get more bang for your buck as each slice comes in at $7.50. 

I have not tried the other items and I hope to do so one day, but for now, it's just me and the Royal Chocolate Mousse cake with a glass of milk or red wine.

Thanks.

P.S. Service was great. The cashier was making jokes and hitting up great conversations with everyone. He definitely knew his clientele and I appreciate that kind of effort. 

Grade: A"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-03-07,4,"I pass Mille-Feuille twice a day and this is my first time stopping in. I loved the huge, glass coffee mug. It must hold 16 oz. and helped carry me through a long evening at the theater. The star of this show however is the Almond Croissant, a favorite and one that I have a bad habit of seeking out and ordering.
Graced with plenty of almond filling, crisp on the outside and soft inside, this ranks up with other well known patisseries. The total, with the enormous cup of coffee ( which I did not love but I am spoiled at work with Stumptown) was 7.50, not bad and in fact,a true NYC bargain."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-03-03,5,"They have the best croissants I ever tasted in the US. Very good pastries in general, and great coffee. Very friendly and helpful staff. It is an amazing gem in this neighborhood.

I've been a regular customer over the past few years and going to Mille-Feuille is always a great way to start my day."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-03-03,5,"I love going to bakeries and this one was definitely at the top of my list in New York. The French donut with chocolate is definitely the best baked good on the menu. The outer crust was crunchy and the layers of the donut were super flaky. The chocolate on top added sweetness that cut the savoury aspect of the donut. Overall, I was incredibly pleased and would recommend it to anyone visiting the bakery. The only downside is that it is oily - but the oiliness of the donut doesn't really detract from the taste. 

The chocolate croissant was tasty as well but make sure to ask them to heat up the croissant so the chocolate is melty. Same goes for the apple desserts. Worth the wait to warm it up! 


Overall, it's a great bakery to pick up layered goods. Every item we ate was delicious and we enjoyed it so much that we brought some home with us. The coffee is also pretty good here too!"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-03-01,3,I wanted to have a GOOD mille-feuille for a while and unfortunately this was dissapointing for me. The puff pastry was good only the cream was bland. A lot of vanilla seeds but still didnt feel satisfied. For me a mille-feuille should be filled with a real pastry cream and this was like a tasteless whipped cream.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-02-17,4,I highly recommend the french doughnut.  It was truly a delight.  It was light  fluffy and not too sweet.  It paired perfectly with a cup of cofffee.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-01-27,5,"Worth seeking out for the almond croissant alone, but we sampled several items, and everything was wonderful. Excellent coffee, too. It's on the pricier side, but it's a perfect example of getting what you pay for. We'll definitely come back."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-01-21,5,"Fabulous ham and cheese croissants, pastries and coffee, all served with a smile. There are lots of bakeries in this neighborhood but I wouldn't go anywhere else."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-01-09,3,"Some hits, some misses, and an overall feeling of the taste being closer to Paris Baguette and Tour Les Jours than, say, Levain or even Recolte. 

First, to the obvious namesake. I've been spoiled by Martha's absolute behemoth of a mille-feuille and I wasn't too taken by a version that was maybe a half of the size and almost double the price. But I ate my words as soon as I took that first bite: the creme is absolutely on-point and the flaky layers snapped and cracked, as they should.  The pastry was a little stale around the edges but overall, a very good dessert. 

The macarons were a little disappointing. Very little jelly in the middle and, despite trying a few different flavors, almost all of them tasted way too sweet and one-note. Except for the rose, which was way too floral. 

I've also sampled several of the pound cakes (actually, one of my favorite things to order in a bakery is a good pound cake, despite my proclivity to eat the whole entire loaf in one go). The walnut cake was the best: good and moist, while the lemon cake was overwhelmingly tart and the caramel cake ended up being a touch soggy and greasy in the middle. 

I really wish they would expand and add some more seating space. As it stands now, there's only one long aisle running parallel to the counter and some narrow seats jutting along the aisle. You're basically knocking your bags and winter puffy coats into people's heads as you try to figure out whether you're more in the mood for a chocolate pecan tart versus an almond croissant. A lot of other people clearly love MF, however, so I may revise once I try more things."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2019-01-06,4,"I've tried their Macarons at Bastille day festival. The rose petal macaron is my favorite, so delicious! It tastes like real roses. Will go to the store to try it again and other flavors too."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-12-30,5,"Mille- Feuillle  is a small bakery that specializes in French pastries and Croissants.
The coffee is served in stylish white mugs and is excellent. The aroma is one of a great roast and the flavor in the mouth has hints of dark chocolate.
The croissant is one of the best I have ever had: golden brown, crunchy, buttery but not overwhelmingly fatty. The pain aux raisins( raisin bread) had just the right amount of sweetness and the soft filling contrasted well with the baked crust.
The STAR was the galette des rois : this pastry celebrates Epiphany and is baked throughout  the month of January in France. The owner shared with us that it is their specialty . Made of two circles of puff pastry separated by a frangipani ( almond  cream) filling , it was so good that the slice disappeared in 30 seconds. The plan is to have another one tomorrow morning .
To the yelpers reading this: trust me, go to millefeuille bakery and get this slice of heavenly pastry before they are out !!!
6 STARS !!!"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-12-27,2,"The lady working was welcoming and polite. The baked goods were neatly displayed and the bakery was clean overall.

I got the croissant and mille feuille cake to take home. The croissant was okay and it was like any other croissant from a bakery. The cake was extremely disappointing. The cake did not taste fresh at all. The pastry wasn't flaky and it was not enjoyable. 

I would not recommend this bakery."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-12-15,1,Horrifyingly bad customer service. Rude staff. Inability to properly complete an order. NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER will I support this business.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-12-06,5,"Amazing! Tried the veggie quiche, chocolate doughnut, cherry pistachio pastry, and the macaroons. All were fantastic but the chocolate doughnut especially is a MUST. The staff is also great, very detail oriented."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-11-30,4,"Mille-Feuille is one of my favorite cafe-bakeries on the Upper West Side.

The baked goods, obviously the main draw, are very good. Not to the level of ""venture here specifically to try these,"" like nearby neighbor Levain, but to enjoy with coffee and a book or some work-from-home tasks, they're great. I'm particularly a fan of the almond croissant, but haven't gone wrong with anything yet.

The lattes are also great, and not too pricey by NYC standards.

Mostly, I like Mille-Feuille because they have all the ""little things"": ample outlets, enough tables/chairs that there's usually one available without a wait, and a well-kept public restroom. Like most places in New York, it's a tight space, and more room for spreading out with books or a laptop would be ideal. But it's more comfy and has better eats/drinks than any other cafe I've yet found on the UWS, so for now, it'll more than do."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-11-28,4,I pop in here a lot for pastries and coffee. The pastries are really good and they do a solid chicken curry sandwich. I just wish ether had a little more seating and maybe a few outlets because I would love to be able to sit and take my time with the coffee.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-11-18,3,"When it comes to French pastries, I like to consider myself a connoisseur. I say this to give people an idea of my standard of review and the high expectations I have for great French pastries. After living in France, Switzerland, and London, I've tasted some of the best French pastries in the world. Moving to New York, I was on the hunt for the perfect or at least really good comparable French pastry to what I had experienced. I've tried almost all the French pastry stores in the city, including Maison Kayser (1), Mille-Feuille (2), and Récolte (3). I would rank them in that order, Récolte is a close second but the registers are extremely slow there it's ridiculous (separate review on that).
The croissaints at Mille-Feuille are underwhelming. They are not great, but not bad. They are a little too white and thick inside, not as flaky and buttery as the Maison Kayser brand. It almost tastes a little better than an Air France or airline croissaint. Their other pastries, including almond croissaint and ginger bread are underwhelming too. The ginger bread in particular is VERY dry and actually I would say a grocery store brand is better than what they sell. I also don't think it passes as French, more of an American dessert that people will buy b/c of the location. 
There is almost never a wait though, so that's a plus. I can see a lot of tourists in the connecting hotel next door stop at Mille-Feuille a lot and seem to be pleased w/ the goods but if you are looking for the real thing, this is not it. It's passable for New York, but not satisfying. I would take the time to walk the extra block down to Maison Kayser if you want to feel satisfied from a good French pastry. 
Having said that, Maison Kayser, as good as it is, is not as good as some of the Parisian patisseries and boulangeries, but it's the best I've tried in the city so far."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-11-16,5,"First impression upon walking in is that this place is small and bustling with activity; a short line of people are waiting to place orders, a handful of small round tables along the wall are all occupied (with a young couple, a single woman, and an elderly gentleman reading a newspaper), and behind the glass pastry case, the two staff members are speaking lively and rapid-fire French. 

Service is quick and efficient; I had just enough time to contemplate all the pastry options before it was my turn to order.

The pastries are DELIGHTFUL. The French doughnut is a joy - crispy, gently sweetened layers that are light, airy, and leave you wanting more. The pain aux chocolat and Matcha latte were fairly straightforward, but also good. 

Very positive experience. Would recommend & return."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-10-29,1,The staff is horrible and don't appreciate your business.  Plenty off wonderful places in the city to spend your money - avoid this place.  We all work to hard to be treated like dirt by a restaurant and it's management.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-10-28,5,"Simply the best coffee and French pastries and baked goods.  I go nearly every day for a large americano. Where else does it come with three espresso shots? Sure it's small and seating is limited. But owner and staff and always pleasant. No wonder the place is thriving, even though it's just steps from a Maison Kayser chain outlet and a short walk to other competitors."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-10-14,4,"A frensh style local bakery, high quality coffee, extreemly friendly service, the best ever almond croissant, must try"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-10-13,5,"Small, but excellent bakery on the upper west side that serves artistically made French style pastries, macaroons and other delicacies.  I had breakfast here and our selections were wonderful.  I had a quiche Lorraine and my wife had a chocolate croissant.  We both absolutely loved our selections.  The coffee was also very good and the service was very pleasant.  The décor is also very attractive.  One thumb up (I'm using the other one to type)!"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-09-29,1,I'd give no stars if possible. Another overrated NYC rip off. All the pastries are over cooked and tasteless. My cookie was 5 steps below Trader Joe's take And bake.   Coffee was ok. Staff was ok.  Mille-Feuille was bland and pastry was nearly burnt. It's their signature item and it was nothing near good.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-09-23,3,"Good coffee. I had the chocolate mouse. It was way too rich and sweet. I could not finish it. I was hoping to try the mille feuille, but they were sold out."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-08-12,5,"I haven't ordered from here in a while, mostly because The Great British Bakeoff hasn't been airing so I haven't needed a sugar fix, but this place is definitely worth a trip if you live in or around the UWS. The pastry for which it's named is probably their best. The macarons aren't quite La Duree, in my opinion, but they're close, and the other baked goods are mostly better."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-07-27,5,"small place with tiny tables, awesome deserts (lemon merengue, opera cake, something with raspberries) and very good drinks (latte, chai latte, hot chocolate). goos service too."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-07-24,3,"I ordered an espresso and an almond croissant. The espresso was above average; the almond croissant, meh. As for service, pretty much nonexistent. When it was my turn to order, I told the cashier my order and waited for two minutes for her to charge my card,etc. while she seemed to be taking care of other customers who were not in line. but after the 2min wait she said she didn't hear anything/wasn't aware I was ordering, so I waited 2min for nothing and had to repeat my order. Through the whole process, very cold tone, no smile. Then I had to wait for my food for 4 more minutes, even though the croissant was in the display counter and would literally take one second to be retrieved, and it takes less than a minute to make an espresso--turned out they didn't have a plate so I had to either wait for a plate for my croissant or have it in a paper bag, even though I ordered to stay. Lol what kind of a business doesn't have a plate:) Overall, simply put, the food is too mediocre to justify the lousy service."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-07-11,5,"Wonderful, fresh Pain au Chocolat. I enjoyed it more than the Chocolate Croissants I ate in Paris."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-07-07,5,What a gem of a place! Beautiful pastries made to perfection. The macaroons will melt in your mouth. They have a buy three get two free special over the weekends. The owner was kind enough to make me a triple shot cappuccino. The bakery is a stone's throw from Central Park on a beautiful tree lined street. The interior of the bakery has a European feel to it with the most amazing preparations. Not to be missed on your visit to NYC. Locals love this store and the owner.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-07-03,5,Got an assortment for my niece and sister. They loved it -all. Every single item. There were six. I don't remember which. I had help from the girl behind the counter. And I chose one or two based on looks. I'll be back
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-06-27,5,Came here few months ago and they were closed for renovation. Place now looks very clean. Probably the cleanest rest room in a restaurant I have seen. Cappuccino was out of this world!  The Mille feuille was amazing. I would definitely come back. Friendly staff
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-06-17,1,"They have wonderful baked goods! However, in a recent visit the staff was very unprofessional to my friend. They were rude, pushy and accused him of 'waiting too long' to order. He had only been standing and perusing the pastries for 30 seconds tops. After he placed the order for croissants he proceeded to the register. At the register, the woman at the register insisted that he show her proof of money before even ringing him up. This was appalling and humiliating to any customer. He were very upset and felt disrespected as a result of this experience. He also happened to be the only person of color in the establishment, no one else in the bakery was treated this way. The staff did not realize I was with him and I witnessed the entire exchange happen. I hope management reevaluates how their staff treats their customers of all ages, races and ethnicities who are simply trying to enjoy breakfast without getting harassed."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-06-13,5,"I had the plain doughnut this morning. It's a cronut, so it's flaky like a croissant. This was good, a bit greasy but I still liked it. It actually tasted a lot like those little sugar coated Chinese doughnuts they have at Chinese buffets. Those are my guilty pleasure so this was just like the boujee version of that. 

The other pastries looked really good so I'll have to go back sometime. They also have a breakfast special of a croissant or pain au chocolate and a coffee for $5 that I'm gunna have to take advantage of sometime soon."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-06-08,5,"I am not one to hand out 5 stars without some thought, but I LOVED this place!  It was the best part about staying at NYLO which was just okay.  This place made it worth it!  The Matcha Latte was sooooo good, but the best part is feeling truly in NY and at a Paris cafe at the same time!  It is absolute eye candy in there!!  Nice pastry box of so many colors and cool looking desserts.  I had the quiche which was awesome.  I came back two days in a row if that tells you anything.  Best coffee I had in the city.  I don't like going places alone, but I was so comfortable sitting sitting at my little table drinking my latte.  I am a fan!!!"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-05-31,5,"When my pastry chef friends recommended this place as one of the top places of their craft in NYC I knew it had to be good. 

When I walked in and saw the adorable sleek space, was greeted with French style and got a gaze of the pastry case, it dug deeper.

Coffee was gorgeous, and s little puff pastry was perfection. 

The place doesn't feel over exposed or overly commercial.  It feels sublime and perfectly done."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-05-13,5,"A little piece of Paris in Manhattan. I love this place. Bakery goods are amazing. The $5 breakfast is such a good deal! Everyone is so nice and the manager is so attentive! The service is impeccable. They make you feel at home, really. And YES, they have mugs and real plates!! Can't stand places that only use paper cups and plastic cutlery."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-04-28,5,Any branch is simply great with the delicious desserts and plenty of coffee alternatives. Definite stop-by for a French style coffee shop experience.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-04-27,3,"A cozy, cute bakery in the Upper West Side. It's quite popular with lots of regulars, it seems. Service was nice and efficient. The dishware was warm, and I like that. To me, it means it was just washed in hot water and dried perfectly. Nice"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-04-24,5,"Why there's not a place like this in Miami!???!! Best latte ever, delicious sweet treats. Small but cozy."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-04-20,2,I used to come here for iced matcha latte last summer and it was great. Last weekend it was warm enough to try iced matcha so I visit the cafe and immediately noticed the place was different. I realized after I ordered that they changed ownership. My latte was bad. They charge extra for almond milk but they only put a drop in. It tasted like just matcha and water. I would not go back.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-04-01,4,"Super cute boutique coffee place with amazing French pastries! It can get really crowded inside and hard to order. The coffee is amazing, I got the mocha a week ago and have been back twice since!"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-03-28,5,"One of the best bakeries in NY, this place is legit. Like going to a bakery in France. I recommend the French donuts which are similar to cronuts only I prefer these because I feel the flavor of the dough is more developed and buttery. Their st honore cream puffs are the perfect bites -- piped with strong vanilla flavored cream and crunchy bitter caramel. I usually can't resist getting it. Obviously the Mille-Feuille layered dessert is also legit. I think anything you try will be amazing. They're also known for their macarons which pack tons of flavor and have a good chew. Seriously go."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-03-25,4,"Big fan of this bakery.  I got the almond croissant which was one of the best I've ever had.  The filling they use inside is unreal!  It also was a big size and not overly expensive.   

I also got a latte which was solid.  Not the best I've ever had but definitely worth getting.

Will definitely be back!

Note: They no longer serve pistachio croissant (per the server). Would recommend they bring that back!"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-03-18,5,"Came here for a quick bite I got my usual ham and cheese croissant, it was very delicious and the cheese was nice and creamy. The desserts here are very yummy I tried a pistachio macaroon and it was so good perfect in crunch and softness. The macaroons were delicious but much much smaller than the usual macaroons. There's not much seats here about six to seven tables of two. Overall the bakery is very cute and great for quick breakfast bite. The staff are nice and welcoming they have a bathroom available and WiFi"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-02-17,4,"Came here for a quick lunch, ordered a latte which came with a cute heart pattern and had a ham and cheese on a croissant which they warmed up for me. They had a cute selection of goods and a few seats to enjoy them. Would come back here if I'm in the neighborhood."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-01-30,4,Really fresh really great pastries!!! This place feels more boutique than the really popular Maison Keyser that is popular here in NYC. I prefer this place- selection is smaller but the pastries taste lighter which eliminates that guilty feeling after indulging in the forbidden pastries. Went here one morning when we were staying at the Nylo and it was in a great convenient location! Must try!!!
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-01-18,5,This is the delicious decaf cappuccino they made for my daughter--and their pastries and quiche are always wonderful
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2018-01-06,4,Amazing macaroons. Totally recommend the green tea one. Servers are really nice and the place is so cute. Only complaint is not enough seats and their green tea mach latte is good but after awhile it started to taste like spinach.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-12-23,5,"I can't rave enough about this place!! 

After a certain hour (I'm not sure exactly when) half of their baked goods go on sale for half off. Everyone was very friendly and helpful in helping me pick which breads I'd like based on my preferences.

Unfortunately, they were sold out of their almond croissant, however,I had the raspberry almond croissant and was very, very pleased. I normally don't like fruits/jams due to the overwhelming sweetness but appreciated the light, fresh raspberries in the croissant. 

+ Ample samples
+ Can't beat the price
+ Pastries are deliciouss!"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-12-18,4,We came here after lunch to enjoy some dessert and coffee. We shared the mille-feuille and a hot cappuccino which went perfectly together. It definitely warmed me up from the snow storm outside. The staff was also super nice. The only down side is the limited seating here.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-12-18,5,"Such a quaint little shop!! I pass this place everyday on the way to school, and I always see signs for their breakfast and lunch specials. I finally had time to stop in today and was floored by how sweet and prompt the staff was. Plus, a decently priced, delicious breakfast made my morning. I'll have to come back again to try the different pastries I was nearly drooling over"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-12-13,3,"The pastries actually look a bit better than they taste. There are lots of tarts and macarons and eclairs..... and while nothing I tasted was ""bad"" by any means.... nothing was particularly noteworthy either. The coffee, however, was really great..... fresh, hot, and an ample sized cup."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-11-22,1,"Everything is ok. Passable. However what really turned me off was the Algerian employee that decided to get on the phone and go on a diatribe about the horrible French people that took over his country...as I'm sitting there with my French in laws understanding every word he was saying. 

That's the thing about NYC. People here are so international that most understand 2 to 3 languages...with French being one of the more popular. I'm not sure working hours are for going on political rants on your phone in front of customers who just want to enjoy a hot beverage and a pastry. Perhaps the management should train the staff to be more professional.

Especially ironic given that it's a French pastry shop......"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-11-15,5,"This place is my favorite bakery to visit every time I go to New York.
It's a place u can enjoy any French desert u crave for without breaking ur wallet. Their apple pies are simply delicious.
Every thanksgiving, my family and I order all the deserts we need from them and they never disappoint us.
Sometimes, my kids and I just walk down there just to try out their samples at the store. 
It's located in a very clean and beautiful neighborhood which is very important to me.
I love their French chef, he just have amazing skills with food.
Meanwhile, the bourbon flavor from this bakery will keep u salivating all day long if u live or work close by.
We will be visiting again next week when we visit New York for this thanksgiving."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-11-12,4,"I had the stacked pastry puffs with the vanilla flan. At first bite/glance I was surprised how it was harder and not soft flakey as you would expect it. It also wasn't very sweet but perfect for a coffee or tea drinker.

I really enjoyed it with the matcha latte although next time I will only have 1/2 of it! Orrrrr I might just get the flan instead

Quick note: cramped space and limited goodies but perfect for both savory or sweet. They have almond milk."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-11-10,4,"Had the Praline Mille-Feuille. Met expectations but didn't wow. Loves the chocolate crossaint! Mixed reactions on the iced mocha, but I'm not from NY so I wouldn't judge. Every country seems to have their own version of an iced mocha..."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-10-30,5,"Nice people, great pastries and baked goods. Baguettes and quiches too. Perfect for quick breakfast or lunch or special treat. Oh, coffee and tea are excellent too"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-10-28,5,"I love Mille-Feuille... a thousand fold!;-) In the last few years many cafés have opened around town. Mille Feuille is is by far my favorite. Just today I enjoyed the most amazing delicious vegetables quiche with mushrooms and a generous big latte in a glass. I ate especially slowly, I wanted the great taste to linger as long as possible.
The atmosphere and interior are bright and lovely, very nice and friendly staff, a nice display of sweet and salty goodies and very clean. I'm European with family in Italy, France and Germany and this cafe is able to keep up with the best cafés in Europe.
 Merci bien, mille feuille, for saving me a trip to Europe to enjoy yummy treats.-)"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-10-27,4,This place is cute inside. Pretty much what you would expect from a frenchy little cafe in the city. It has lots of pastries to choose from and everything is well crafted. The coffee isn't too bad. I'm never totally in love with the coffee when it comes to places like this. They're pastries are great but lack in coffee. Its usually your little hipster joints that will serve up smooth coffee.
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-08-18,2,"Service here is terrible. Donuts are too greasy. They have a cute little interior, but overall this spot is not worth the trip. Espresso drinks are not made with much love. Maison Kaiser just a few doors down is a better pick."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-07-27,4,"The place itself is very tiny and cute. It is very organized and there are so many colorful pastries. Ordering was a breeze and the staff was very nice. I managed to score 50% off my croissant after maybe 6 pm which ended up being a relatively good price ($1.50-$3). There is very limited seating, about 7 tables with two chairs each so seating can be difficult when there are a lot of people.

The food overall was pretty good. I ordered a raspberry almond croissant with a panatea matcha latte. The croissant was very flakey and buttery. The almond filling was very smooth and consistent throughout the croissant. My only dislike about the raspberry croissant is the powder outside. It gave the croissant a very sour taste which contradicted the sweetness from the raspberry almond combination inside. But despite that, I would recommend it and will come back to try the other flavors. As far as the matcha latte, I have had better. The flavoring was not as strong and there was more milk present in the drink. I will most likely stick to their sweets in the future."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-07-21,5,"The atmosphere here is intimate.  The restaurant really has a French flair!  They serve an assortment of really good pastries and macaroons, donuts etc.  But if you are looking for something lower in carbs try their quiche. We had their ham and cheese quiche and it was so good we went back for breakfast the next three days!  Also, their coffee was of a pretty high quality.  It was delicious - much better than the usually run-of-the-mill you get elsewhere!  Also the manager and workers were extremely friendly!  Highly recommend!!!
Bonus - there is a market next door so you can grab a piece of fruit on and be on your way ;-)"
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-07-05,4,"Willing to walk several blocks out of my way for this place: they serve La Colombe coffee and most of their baked goods are excellent as is their service. Specifically, the Blueberry Tarte Fine is AMAZING! And their ""french doughnut"" (cronut?) is yummy if a little greasy. Weirdly, their Mille-Feuille has been the only item I've found even a little disappointing."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-06-09,5,"Popped into this adorable and yummy bakery to grab a coffee and a treat (or two) before heading off to a long day of work while staying at the Milburn nearby.  Delicious, beautiful and a perfect set-up to my day.  I even managed to get 4 pastries home to Chicago in one piece to enjoy with my daughter. Check them out next time you're on the Upper West Side - Manhattan."
240,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-3,2017-06-03,5,"I stopped by for a cup of coffee and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. So rich and full of body. The barista was nice and friendly. Inside, the decor is lovely and clean. 

The cafe is in a public transportation friendly area, but then again it's in NYC so how couldn't it be? Wonderful area in Upper Side of Manhattan. 

If you're in the area, stop by"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2020-03-19,5,"I absolutely love their iced oat latte! it's kinda pricey but it's super delicious. they have brunch as well and probably will try that next time! the inside is also really nice, has a great seating area for those who want to dine in. will be coming back again!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2020-02-26,4,"This is a nice Cafe at the upper West side. The place was spacious and their sugar sensiyive light foods were good. I had a very nice breakfast here recently with my friend. Their lunch sandwich and the cappuccino and their pastry made my day. 

The only one downside was the dirty bathroom. Maybe that was just a bad day."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2020-01-11,5,So good!  Nice seating (limited) in the back.    Chai tea was too sweet but their coffee was excellent.  The barista looked very focused on his creations.  Would definitely return when I am in the area.   Very loud.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2020-01-09,4,"Best coffee on the UWS with a nice curated selection of pastries and made-to-order food. The harvest bowl salad and egg plate are my favs. The lines are often outrageously long, but move at a steady clip- it's worth the wait if you have the time. Plus, a great spot to cowork or for a coffee date."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2020-01-08,3,"Yeah not what it used to me.  This was probably my fav coffee shop in NYC and this was my fav location.  Not anymore.  They changed their menu, the bread and the coffee just isn't the same."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-12-31,5,"_As always_ with my coffee shop reviews, this one answer the question: is this a good place to come and get some work done?

The answer is: strong yes if you come _early_; maybe less so during the many peaks that it (justly) enjoys. 

The reason it gets less good to work is simple: around 830-9am on weekdays and weekends it gets New York-y and crowded and, obviously, therefore harder to focus. Not a lot to do about that. It's a popular place; I don't want it not to be.

Here's why I found it nice to work in during those ""off"" hours. The off hours I utilized were early: from opening at 630 or 7am until 830 or 9am -- those were my good hours. I bet there are other ""off"" hours during the day when the rhythm slows down, but idk when they'd be. Anyway here's what's good:

-- No wifi. WHAT? But I'm telling you because maybe you're like me and you're like, ""what???"" but then you're like...""oh, but that's better for some kinds of work."" Right? So that's how I was with this, and I appreciated it. Obviously if you need wifi that isn't so good.

-- Nice staff. They're friendly. They talk you through the drinks. I got guided to a matcha latte with soy milk that was delicious. Which leads to...

-- Good coffee, good drinks. All I had was regular coffee and that matcha latte with soy. Both were good and I looked forward to them.

-- Nice space. Especially, if you're working, that area in the back. Just as it can get kind of clattered and noisy when full, it's serene and secluded when not crowded.

So that's what I got. There are specific parameters -- watch out for the busy times; no wifi! -- but as long as you're prepared to roll with those, which yes might take a little familiarization, I've found this to be my favorite spot on the UWS as of 2018/19 to sit with my laptop and get some work done."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-12-30,4,"It is a pretty nice and spacious coffee shop. I came here for brunch/snack and was very nice, quick and pleasant. I could sit and talk without bumping into other people and hearing what they are doing and talking about. Food options are good for people with dietary restrictions. 
They also had water and cups so you do not need to request, just come and take. 
I was not impressed with dirty bathroom... it was 1 pm and bathroom was pretty dirty. I think it needs to be cleaned more often"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-12-22,4,Busy place with a lot of tables taken with people on laptops. Good bacon and egg brioche roll and the coffee was better than the NY average. Fast service.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-12-21,4,"I really enjoy their cappuccinos and lattes here. I normally stop in for a breakfast in between sessions. I have tried the market plate but really recommend the egg white toast. I can't remember the name but it comes with roasted red peppers, no cheese, on sourdough. I love that their dishes comes with a nice Spring Mix tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.  I love a side of roughage.  The eggs could always be a touch softer even though I always request soft eggs. The customer service can be a little up and down. Sometimes there are bright spots in the staff and sometimes there are dry spots. There is plenty of seating here in both the front and the back. The bathroom (a singelton) is roomy and clean. They have a drink punch card though they have never offered me one even though they have asked the person right in front of me. I like the location as well since it's pretty close to the red line at 79th. 

The pastries look good. I would like to try them one day. I tried a chocolate pound cake but it was best with the coffee not so satisfying on its own.

They could get to 5 stars if their staff was more consistent, if they offered me a drink card (petty) and if they had drink condiments where you pick up your drink versus having to go to another location to get the caffeine dressed up. Same with salt and pepper. I have to go get packets. It may sound silly but once I left my plate to go grab some condiments and my plate was taken away. They made me another but still - could've been avoided."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-12-14,4,"I love this place most at odd hours when it's relatively empty. Otherwise it's packed with people (students, writers, young parents with babies, etc.). 

The coffee is excellent and their pastry selection from local bakeries is great as well. The bagel sandwiches and lunch sandwiches get the job done, but are nothing extraordinary.

They have a lot of seating but tbh most of the time it's pretty hard to find a comfortable spot. No wifi btw."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-12-04,2,"It was a nice, cozy atmosphere but theres no wifi. My avocado toast was very good. However, coffee shops with plenty of seating in NYC but no wifi seem like a waste."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-11-29,4,"A cosy and warm local coffee, friendly service, good coffee and corasoin, highly recommended"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-10-29,1,"BE WARNED - NO WIFI!!! I also didn't have cell phone service in parts of the space. I didn't realize this until after I spent $17 on a latte and avocado toast. The latte was sub-par and the avocado toast, while tasty, was not worth the price I paid. The tables are small but plentiful and the space was not functional for groups of more than 2 people. The only real saving grace was the kind staff that worked there. I will not be returning."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-10-26,5,The avocado toast was amazing the star being the bread! The coffee is also really good and not overall sweet.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-10-15,5,Fresh ingredients. Light refreshing breakfasts. Good coffee. Nice staff and casual ambiance. Usually a line sometimes difficult to find seating.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-10-11,5,"Irving Farm is a solid choice for coffee and food. I would give their coffee 4 stars, but their food choices are excellent. I love that they have Brazilian cheese bread as one of their pastries. The cheddar scallion scone is also delicious. Plus one star for the continuously friendly faces and the fact that they have a punch card to earn a free drink!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-10-08,3,"NOT AN INTERNET CAFE!
So only three stars for that, since they advertise as being such (first thing that comes up in most search engines, too). Food is good, hang is good, nice enough place to work, but not if you need a wifi connection. They should change their preferences in the search engines."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-10-03,5,This is such a nice little place to have coffee and get some work done. This staff is so friendly and the coffee is great. I didn't order any food but it all sounded really good! They also have oat milk!!
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-09-29,4,Breakfast burrito has a genuine kick to it which I can respect. The side salad is a nice addition. Pour over iced coffee is flavorful and they are holding out with the plastic straws. Would recommend taking your order to go though and heading down to riverside park - inside decor did not appeal to me and as others have noted there is no WiFi provided.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-09-29,4,"No wi-fi ...but otherwise good beverages eg tea and food. Atmosphere is also decent, noisy but not too cramped. There's enough staff as well."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-09-27,3,"So I totally was drawn in by the wonderful smell of bacon even though I'm a vegetarian lol. I got the breakfast burrito, the people behind the counter were super sweet and concise and it came out pretty quickly. It also kept well given I had to wait an hour to eat it because I had an appt. 
Once I finally ate it everything was fine until the end of the burrito....there were egg shells allll up in it, like not just one or two but maybe a whole half egg worth of egg shells and it was too late because the bite of burrito was already in my mouth. Gross way to end your almost 10 dollar burrito. I could have made myself the same thing for less and no egg shells ya know. 
I know for sure it was an accident, the cooks must have been rushing for the busy morning crowd. Regardless I saw many happy customers around and their menu options are great and ultimately 9.75 is not that much anymore for a burrito BUT I hope this review just brings the mistake to their attention so it doesn't have to happen to anyone else. 

Wish I could have been refunded :( But thanks for doing your best Irving farm, I may still come back we'll see."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-09-26,1,"NO WIFI

How is there a coffee shop in NYC without WiFi? WTF are they thinking? I am so disappointed I ordered coffee and an expensive sandwich before realizing this. I will never come back here."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-09-11,2,"You walk in and immediately think it's a large space but once you take a look, walk around, the layout of tables feels cramped, dark and a bit dirty. 

I tried to do work here but the overall vibe was eh. The one downtown is definitely more the move."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-09-01,5,"As a tourist who has visited two times now, I was looking for a place exactly like this. Somewhere you can go that's not directly in the hustle and bustle of the city, yet in the city. The coffee was absolutely delicious and so was the food. Ive already recommended people to this place and will be returning. This is now on my list as #1 coffee hang out in the city."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-08-29,2,"NOT easily stroller accesible  (a few steps down). 
I really wanted fo like IF. Guess I chose the wrong item? I wasted almost $5 in the worst donut I could find. First of all, folks at IF, let me remind you that the shape of your ""donut"" is actually the one of a bundt cake. Maybe you want to call it by its name so people don't actually expect a donut? (Check my pics to see the bottom of this food item). 
Second, the flavor. It was supposed to be ""chocolate caramel"" but it had nothing but a fat flavor and then and extra sweet frosting. Disappointed  
The 2 stars is because the place is roomy and well decorated, a nice atmosphere but I don't think I will be back. Sorry"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-08-23,5,Shay and Melanie rock! Great service. Love the space here and the quality of the food.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-07-29,5,"We ate breakfast/brunch here 3 times on out recent trip to NY. My husband, son, and I absolutely Irving Farms. Each time we ordered the Market Plate with bacon, the egg, bacon, and cheese on whole wheat bagel, latte, iced Americano, and iced tea (the red one). The Market Plate is everything you'd want in a breakfast plate. It had fresh scrambled eggs, a good helping of salad, avocado slices, sweet potatoes, and a side of applewood bacon. The bagel sandwich was also excellent. The bagel was perfect with a little crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. We love that this place serves healthy breakfast/brunch. Prices are also reasonable. One note though, on the weekends, it gets pretty crowded and seating is limited. However, we had no problems finding seats on the weekdays."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-07-28,3,"Went on a lone journey to this spot Sunday morning after hearing from a friend that this was her go-to coffee shop. Spent 17 bucks on an average plate of breakfast food and a solid cold brew in a mason jar - pretty much what I expected. I liked the cohesive rugged interior design. Ambience is dim, chill, and noisy with a welcomed draft of AC to top it all off on this humid summer day. Not too crowded, but to my disappointment, tables are tiny and circular, and there's NO WIFI - not ideal for working, which is why I came originally. This place does the job for a quick bite while chatting with an old friend, but that's pretty much it."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-07-25,1,"Used to love this place.  It is expensive, but they had two awesome lunches on the menu Super Freak (a delicious salad blend of super foods) and the best Shakshuka in the city.  They have since removed both from the menu with no real replacement for the Shakshuka and a very mediocre Kale and Avocado salad replacing the Super Freak.  :("
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-07-25,5,"This place was lovely! I always walk past it when I walk my dog but I never got the chance to stop in, that is until I woke up way too early for work the other day! I stopped in around 8AM on a Wednesday and there were enough seats for everyone. 
I ordered the bacon egg and cheese and it was phenomenal! The egg was nice and runny, and the bacon was crispy and delicious! So tasty, kept me full the rest of the day! 
The cold brew was excellent too! They have soy milk and oat milk as dairy substitutes. 
They also have a little refrigerated section with cups of yogurt, orange juice, water bottles, etc. 
my boyfriend got the bean breakfast wrap (idk if that's actually what it was called.) but it was VERY heavy and filling! Came with a little side salad too. 
We also split the Brazilian cheese bread and it was INCREDIBLE! 
Will definitely be returning!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-07-18,2,"I used to like this place but sadly they have recently changed the food menu and it is much more limited than it used to be. I went in last weekend to grab some breakfast sandwiches to-go for me and my family and I was quite surprised at how limited their options were. My two main complaints: 1) our bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches were so basic and sloppily made that I hardly think it was worth the $9+ price point. 2) I asked the cashier if I could order 2 simple egg and cheese on a wraps since they have a breakfast burrito on the menu and they make everything to order. The cashier said with a smile, ""I'm sorry we can't do that. There is no way for me to put that into the system."" So I was basically forced to order two $9.75 breakfast burritos and asked for all the additional mix-ins on the side. Of course if I had gotten a simple egg and cheese wrap it would have been cheaper so I felt like this was just another way to force people to pay more. All that I ask is that they find a way to make things more flexible for people who have certain dietary restrictions. Otherwise, I won't be able to be back. All in all, we had decent breakfast sandwiches for over $40 and they were definitely not worth the price. The corner store down the street would have been sufficient enough but unfortunately they weren't open yet for the day.."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-07-16,4,"I was looking for a very casual coffee shop where I could get some studying in and have a good meal with coffee, and Irving Farm fit the bill. You seat yourself and the majority of people are in their laptops or reading. The atmosphere is quiet with a couple of parties having quiet conversations, and also clean with great wall decorations. 

I ordered the Harvest Bowl which was much larger than I expected, a great problem to have. Maybe it was the quinoa or the sweet potatoes, but I was stuffed and had to toss the last few bites. Seriously delicious, filling, and healthy. The coffee was also good. A large variety of options and they make their single pours with a Kalita. Hard to find many faults."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-07-14,3,"EH. Not impressed. Came here on a Friday later after work for a pick me up cold brew around 7 pm and the place was fairly empty. The coffee shop was actually pretty big, very deceiving from the outside. They had seating in the both the front and the back with a really cool wall in the back of the shop. Something about the feel of the place didn't jive with me though. I got a small cold brew and asked for almond milk, they didn't have. I don't get that. Birch coffee doesn't have almond milk either and it's annoying. I don't want oat milk or soy, I want almond. I think it's a statement kind of thing, like if you carry oat milk instead of almond you're in a different category that the other shops. The only category I put coffee shops in that don't have almond milk is the category of places I wouldn't make my regular shop. Anyways, the small cold brew was $4. I didn't think it was anything great. Cold brew is a treat, for me at least, I think it tastes like coffee ice cream when it's a good brew, this was not delicious. Didn't do anything for me. The staff was nice enough, the place seemed conducive to posting up for a while to get work done so for those reasons the place was decent but $4 for a small cold brew, I want it to be good and it was mediocre at best."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-06-15,4,"Great coffee, no WiFi. Always plenty of seating. Perfect for a weekend morning. You won't be upset."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-05-30,5,"Such a great coffee shop in my personal favorite part of the uws. The service is always great and if you go on a weekday you might be able to find a spot to get some work done. Whether you prefer hot or cold beverages, they make both exceptionally well. Pastries are delicious. The back room let's in a nice amount of natural sunlight as well"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-05-22,1,"I travel to NYC every 2 months and I always get the avocado croissant without fail. This trip, the avocado toast is no longer the same. One of the worst I've had. Cold toast with cold avocado that is not seasoned well. It was hard to swallow. Definitely a huge disappointment and not sure if I will visit again. Bring back the old avocado toast! This is a step down from before! Thumbs down!!!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-05-18,3,"This has been my favorite coffee shop in NYC for the past year.. I came here religiously every weekend! Their cold brew is delicious, but honestly the reason for my consistent returns is the avocado toast! In my opinion, it was the best avo toast in NYC! That is, until today... they changed the menu this week and to say I'm disappointed is quite an understatement. The avocado toast I received was barely a step above two thinly sliced pieces of wheat wonderbread with a smear of avocado and some red pepper flakes which I practically had to choke down. There is no taste compared to the avo toast from before the menu change. To supplement this sad state of a plated presentation, they threw on a side salad with shaved carrot. Although the greens were fresh and the taste was decent, it's not what I want to eat at 8am with coffee and a side of sub-par avocado toast. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING THE OLD AVO TOAST BACK!!!!! It's the only reason I come here"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-05-15,2,"Two reasons or more for 2 stars 
One you walk in there is one server to take order and it goes as slow as slow can be with no reason.
Second the Ice coffee I got was weak and bitter and over all after I have order they asking again what did you order what size.

For me it was the last time I will go there"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-05-04,4,Wonderful coffee shop with lots of seating and WiFi. Great place to catch up with friends and easy to get to as it's right off the 79th St subway stop. They sell Decaf Coffee beans for $15/bag. I took one star off because the customer service was poor at best.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-04-29,5,"We had lattes, oatmeal with fruit, and overnight oatmeal. My wife and friend both had the overnight...it was cold but yummy. The oatmeal with fruit was tasty and generous.  We'll go back."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-04-21,3,"Cute place for a coffee date and for a quick bite to eat. Not great to get work done, no wi-fi. Not sure why yelp recommended this place as number one for coffee and wifi but come for the coffee!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-03-20,3,"Ummm...I'm not sure how to start writing this review, it's just because everything is under my expectations. The place is good in the picture but in reality lots of messy tables there and no one clean it up! Coffee was okay but my brunch was not. I'm not sure that should I go back again or not but this time I can only give this place 3 stars."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-03-16,5,Great coffee shop with plenty of seating. Pastries etc too but the coffee drinks are hot and made to order.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-02-24,4,"Love the vibe of this coffee shop. My family were planning to check out some of the museums nearby for the day, but we wanted to grab some breakfast and coffee first. We went around 10 am in the morning and there was a huge crowd already, great signs that this place is popular amongst the locals.

I usually stick to one drink when I travel which is the mocha. The chocolate in this drink is spot on. Wasn't too sweet or bitter. Most important, the drink didn't feel heavy. For breakfast, I went with the Bacon Egg and Cheese sandwich on an everything bagel. Solid bagel sandwich, even better than some actual bagel bakeries in NYC. The gruyere and the bacon just make it for me.

This is a great place with warm and welcoming staff. You could tell, that they could tell, that you were from out of town when they started talking more about their coffee and food as they attempt to win you over.

Definitely recommend this place for future tourists and will be back if I'm ever back in town."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-02-04,5,"Nicest people, nicest place ever. I am an unabashed regular here who does tons of writing and drinks a fair share of cappuccinos for hours at a time. The baristas take pride in every single beverage they serve. The cappuccinos and iced lattes have cheered me up through many a trying New York City afternoon. In addition to the strong, full--dare I say, healing?!!--flavor of both drip coffees and espresso-based drinks, they often throw in free good-will coffees since I go so often. This is truly one of my favorite spots in the city. I'm one of many regulars, so it's obvious I'm not alone in thinking this."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-02-03,3,This place is pretty cool. I wanted to try it as a new study spot because I saw they had a decent amount of seating by New York standards. The food and coffee is great. But service kinda stinks and there's no WiFi. So I will not rerun for studying but definitely for a quick bite!
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-02-02,5,"Great coffee! (Offers alternative milks: oat and soy - not almond)

Delish pastries for here or to go. Good menu for cooked brunch, too. 

Lots of seating, but not necessarily quick turnover, esp. mid-day on weekends, because a lot of friends meet to catch up or individuals do work / read. Note: no WiFi (take the opportunity to unplug!). Consistently busy, but not overwhelming. 

Cute space, not quiet (don't try to take calls), friendly staff and customers."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-01-23,2,"The coffee is fine, but the zucchini flax muffin is hard as a rock. Not sure if it was left out, but I'm pretty underwhelmed for a first go around here. $7.25 for a mediocre coffee and doorstop muffin is disappointing."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-01-20,2,I used like the cafe because it's big and there always are some spots for me.  But it's cold inside during winter time and sometimes the music is really noisy.  I am getting disappointed.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-01-05,5,"Great atmosphere, music and food! I ordered the scramble eggs with kale salad and it was great! Cappuccino was a bit bitter but not bad. I would go back for sure and I highly recommend it."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2019-01-04,5,Irving is always packing in a crowd but the employees are clearly hard working and trying to get everyone their order in a timely fashion. I really recommend the hibiscus tea and the Belgian waffle. Come here!!! The high prices are justified.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-12-31,3,"Needed a place to do some work along with a caffeine boost, so I decided to give this place a try. The front half was quite busy and noisy, but I was able to find myself a quaint and quiet spot in a back nook to settle down and set up shop. Coffee in hand, I embarked on research and writing. To my disappointment, there was no WiFi, so I had to use the hot spot on my phone. I was able to get some things done, but the lack of available internet resulted me terminating my stay much sooner than intended.
I did order the avocado toast with a scrambled egg and a hot black coffee, which were both excellent. The spices and toppings on the toast were quite delicious and I will probably be back for it. There were several gluten free options as well, including muffins! I will need to return to taste them. 

In summary:
**NO WIFI**
**head to the back for a quieter atmosphere

241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-12-21,5,I stayed at the hotel across the street during my visit and was so glad to have found this place. I popped in one morning for their two eggs scramble and a chai latte. The eggs came with roasted sweet potatoes with tahini drizzle and some shredded vegetables with a vinaigrette. It was so good. I wish the eggs could've been fluffier but the sweet potato-tahini combination was delicious. NY has so much delicious healthy food!
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-12-21,3,"Food was pretty good, they had oat milk which is my favorite non-dairy milk so that was great BUT they had no WiFi which was super annoying because the ambiance was cool. Could have enjoyed it more if I could check my email"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-12-20,4,"I visited Irving Farm for the first time on Dec. 15, 2018. I'd come looking for beans, really, and they had 'em. I left with a bag of the 71 House Blend, gratified that they were very fresh, having been roasted just 3-4 days prior.

While I was there, I sampled the goods in the form of a cup of the same beans from the big batch urn. I drank it black and was not disappointed. It's a great blend and would make a good daily driver. Served nice and hot and it seemed freshly made.

Service was fine if a bit impersonal, but they were fairly busy at around 2:30 pm on a Saturday. The place was pretty loaded with what looked to be mostly college kids. 

I brewed some of the 71 House Blend a day or two later at home. I don't wanna brag but mine came out better than their batch brew. You know, V60 pourover and all that.

I didn't try any of the food but what I saw going by with the servers looked OK. They were selling lots of it so it can't be terrible, right?"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-12-13,1,The coffee good the food eh. Avocado toast was more like guacamole toast mush . No crunch to toast and it was was overly salted.  Not fresh chunky avocado instead if was like processed guacamole.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-12-09,4,"For me, Irving Farm has been a good cafe for slowing things down and escaping from the usual pace of the city. I go every few weeks for a leisurely coffee and an occasional breakfast sandwich, always with reading material in tow.

Both the drinks and the food are great, and there are fresh pastries brought in from known bakeries. The menu is on the pricier side, in my opinion, so you'll pay for the quality.

The place doesn't have WiFi, and my cell usually has poor signal, especially in the seating area in the back. I personally like having a place to go that forces me to unplug, and while I see some customers on their computers, I'd recommend this cafe for offline reading and/or good conversations with.

UPDATE (12/9/2018): photos of cappuccino and their overnight oats jar!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-12-06,5,"Maybe the best bacon, egg, cheese sandwich (on a brioche bun actually) that I've ever eaten. I wasn't even sure I was hungry, but one look at that mouthwatering morsel and it was gone. Also great coffee and as friendly as thy can be under the crush of customers staffers."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-12-02,4,Good coffee and tasty pastries. More on the expensive side but decent as a light breakfast/brunch.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-11-27,4,"Cute little neighborhood coffee bar. There's some communal seating in the front and tables in the back. Friendly service, good beverages and a small menu to order from if you're hungry for more than coffee and croissants. Nice comfortable vibe. I'm not one to frequent or hang out in coffee bars, but Irving Farm had such a cozy and chill vibe, that I may just catch up with friends in this coffee bar more often."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-11-20,4,Cool coffee shop near American museum of natural history. They were open late which is always nice for us night owls. States they roast there own coffee which is cool. Had a cold brew which was tasty and brewed correctly. My wife had a vanilla latte which she starts was delicious. Had a cool design on it but not exactly sure what it was but more intricate then just a heart. Also have foods options but can not comment on it as we ate dinner just before we went there. Nice place to relax with plenty of seating and plugs for electronics. Recommended a
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-11-03,3,"My americano was served cold after the barista (girl with the beanie) put cold milk in it.  She raised an attitude with me when I asked her to warm it up.  Thumbs down for the tude, but the nice boy at the register was pleasant!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-10-21,5,"Such a cozy coffee place- in a world of Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts, it's so nice to see a nice neighborhood spot. Their mocha and espresso are amazing and it's a wonderful place to bring a laptop and do some work. Will definitely be coming back!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-09-24,5,"I love this place. Great place to sit and people watch or just relax your brain after a long NYC day. Great place to read and relax. They have delicious food, delicious coffee/tea, and super super friendly staff. 
There is NO WIFI. So don't come here with your computer expecting to get some emails out! You won't!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-09-18,2,"A simple coffee to go will do for the future.
The staff has a weird attitude. Kind of passive aggressive. Rubbed me the wrong way. 
Overpriced. 
There's no WiFi. 
The back is super loud. 
Disappointed. Meh."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-09-12,4,Coffee tasted great and cool vibes but no WiFi & ran out of glassware. I had my coffee to stay but they had to put it in a paper cup.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-09-12,2,"A crowded coffee shop without WiFi, and with overpriced mediocre food. The staff is nice, but I don't think I'll be returning here which is unfortunate because it's so close and there aren't too many other options."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-08-22,5,"This is always my go to place when I can't think of anywhere else to go! But not in an it's bad way, just I've been here a bunch. Lol there's obviously a reason why i keep going back. The coffee and the desserts are my favorite, both of which I have not had in a while due to my salad intake. Fortunately, the salads are sooooo good and they are soooo big! Neither me or my mom could finish ours this last time. There was sooo much hummus which we loved at the beginning but then it got kind of overwhelming on the salads we both got but that was ok. 

The croissants are also another favoriteeee, of course I haven't had those in a while either, maybe next time!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-08-22,5,"Irving Farm has the best coffee on the UWS, in my opinion.  My drink of choice is an iced decaf latte with Oat Milk and a touch of their homemade chocolate syrup.  It's truly my favorite drink.  In addition - the cool neighborhood vibe inside and outside is such a pleasure...and the food is always fresh and delicious. Avocado toast, eggs, and baked goods.  All delicious.  IF is the perfect place to catch up with a friend or meet a business associate for a quick meeting."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-08-14,4,Really delicious and cute little coffee shop! I had a hibiscus iced tea and a honey and milk donut. Yumm!
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-08-13,5,"Drinks: My go to is either hot or iced coffee. You can tell that they take a lot of pride in developing their method for cold brew, the flavor is so smooth. I have never been disappointed! Their coffee beans are roasted in Millerton, NY. So you are supporting a NY business by choosing Irving Farm over one of the many other coffee chains in the area.

Food: The home made cheddar biscuit with free range eggs and cheese. I think I've gotten this *almost* every time I visit this location. The biscuit is ridiculously delicious. I have told many friends and relatives that they have to try it and now I'm telling you! Go now! This is seriously a perfect way to start your day. How can you have a bad day after a flaky cheddar biscuit like this?!

Bathrooms: Always clean!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-08-08,4,"Great atmosphere, cozy, good food. The food is fresh, with many choices. The service is friendly and gives many tips if you can't choose from their menu. The cold brew coffee was a bit strong for my taste but good. I find it a great meeting place for friends or a business meeting."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-08-04,2,"Food: 3.5/5 --decent flavor, but food was served cold and portions are unimpressive
Service: 1.5/5 --slow service, were out of options, tables and seats were dirty
Ambiance: 3.8/5 --sunroof was nice. Good cafe vibe"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-08-04,1,"Honestly, this place was terrible. The service was bad, the tables were gross, and there were so many people in there taking up tables that didn't even have anything from the cafe. They were out of sourdough bread and wouldn't let me switch to a croissant and gave me their only bread they had left. Their sandwich was TINY....for $12?! It was a sandwich I could have (and have) easily made at home. The chicken was small and it was the most simple, small sandwich. Should have been $5 at most. My husband's burrito was cold (it had grill marks....at least deliver it hot). We waited about 30 min for our food which is ridiculous for a sandwich. I didn't see anyone cleaning tables or really working for that matter except the cooks and barista. Overall, don't get food here. I can't speak for the drinks. I will never be back here again."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-08-03,4,Ah he sspho shoohwwhsoshzoaaooalzswlssltgvztlllasgtlgvtosallsslstooggbs bb b.  I open quite once a day for
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-07-26,5,"Great atmosphere, love the wood paneling and layout.  We had the grilled pesto chicken which was very tasty. As a word of advice they will bring your food to your table but not your coffee, so keep that in mind when ordering."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-07-24,4,"Very chill coffee shop to get a lot of work done in. No wifi. A bit overpriced, but very good quality. Good vibes to sit and read or work on a paper for a while. Natural lighting in the back and a few tables out front during the warmer seasons."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-07-22,5,"Amazing place!
I've got ""Latte"" with ""Morning Cinnamon Roll"". It was delicious.
Lovely atmosphere and friendly staff!

Good luck, guys!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-07-19,5,Very very good cold brew! I am a regular and work very close to Irving and it has seriously become a staple coffee shop for me. The staff remembers and recognizes their regulars and even will prepare my drink as soon as I walk through the door! Go here !
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-07-17,5,"Seriously the BEST iced latte I've had. This little gem was tucked away just a few steps from my hotel and I'm so glad I stopped in. There are a few tables outside and several more throughout the long, narrow restaurant. 
There are lots of baked goods and other breakfast food to enjoy. 
Seriously, though, I feel that this has just ruined other coffee for me. I will be making a return trip to sample other types of their coffees and maybe watch and see what wizardry they use to make their coffee taste so damn good."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-07-09,1,"I drink espresso everyday, I would never pay more than 3.50 for an espresso which in itself is overpriced in America. I lived in Italy where an espresso is 1 Euro. 

Being in a good cafe to work or catch up with friends is one of my favorite activities to do to unwind in this overly overpriced and busy city.

Irving failed my expectations for a good cafe in the UWS, a neighborhood that I love and grew up in. 

Overpriced ""iced"" espresso. 3.50 and an additional 75cents to add ice. First of all, why would you charge for frozen water ? Let me know. The espresso was not strong at all. They gave me an attitude for wanting to add DROPS of oat milk into my espresso. Can't say much for their coffee everyone is raving about. 

Cafe was noisy, dark, terrible atmosphere and uncomfortable seating.

If i'm getting charged 4.25, at least give me good service, strong beans, and a good atmosphere. 

Won't be going back to any of their locations."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-06-22,3,"The pastry selection is getting worse, presumably because bakeries do not allow coffee shops in each others' vicinity to compete. Joe just opened another location on 72 and Amsterdam which carries fantastic stuff from Ovenly, and Box Kite gets all their pastries from Colson. The croissants from Irving Farm come from Bien Cuit and are excellent. The donuts from Underwest are also great. My favorite is the zucchini bread from Margaret Palca. But I cannot say the same about anything else they currently have here."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-06-18,4,"Decently strong cold brew, on the expensive side. Great looking baked goods display but insanely overpriced, although I decided to splurge on a blueberry thyme donut. The frosting was tasty, the cake was a bit dry but maybe that was because it was pretty late in the day. It sort of tasted like a blueberry muffin. Lots of cool donuts and breads. A bunch of food options with average prices avocado toast. The seating in the back has a skylight but no windows. One restroom. Little patio out front with a few tables. Weirdly they don't put the milk out for people to add themselves, instead adding it for you, which just seems a little controlling, although not really a big problem. The staff is friendly and helpful answering questions about various items, including the cola cold brew."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-06-14,1,"The food here is too expensive for what it's worth. $14 for a bacon, egg and cheese? Craziness... I've live in this neighborhood my whole life, and have never spent so much money on something so basic. Plus the guy at the counter didn't say anything about how much the add ons would cost. I used to be a regular but the place has gone downhill over the years. The service is terrible, and the food is bland at best. I'd recommend checking out the many other places in this neighborhood that are much better in terms of quality of food and price, and much less pretentious."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-06-14,5,"My wife and I visit NYC every June, staying on the Upper Westside on Broadway. We love Irving coffee shop because they have great coffee,  not overroasted like Starbucks, and we love the microbrews, too. Guess what! We are visiting next week, Upper Westside and Broadway!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-06-09,2,"This branch of Irving Farm has some nice people working at the register but there is one really mean young man (short-haired and tall). When you say hello to him he just looks through you as if he wants to kill you or like you don't exist. He seems filled with hate. It's an awful experience to buy coffee from him. Really! I've started walking to Joe because of it. It's not just me--he is unresponsive to and glares at other people. Management should send in a mystery shopper to see for themselves. Other than that, the acoustics here are terrible. It is so loud. And the offerings are way overpriced. Five dollars for a donut that costs $3.50 at Joe. $12 for a grilled cheese sandwich. I like the sandwich, with its zingy mustard, but it's not a $12 sandwich. And the presentation is lacking--it should have a side salad or something rather than just sit unadorned on the plate. (Note: they did just change the menu so I'm not sure they are still serving this sandwich, but in general everything is overpriced and many dishes have a blah presentation.) Lastly, can they improve the system wherein a guy with a loud somewhat harsh voice screams out the number for dishes when they're ready? In a way I've gotten a bit attached to this, but there still something unsettling about it. At any rate, I go to this Irving farm less and less."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-06-07,5,"This place is awesome! They wouldn't let my wife have milk in her pour over (it's a curated collection), so that was a victory for me (I'm always embarrassed when she asks for cream to taint her black elixir.) Plus, you're in good hands when your brew is prepared while wearing an ironic mustache and bike hat. The pour overs were, by the way, awesome."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-06-02,5,"Now I am learning to be a coffee pundit. Thus I went to lots of coffee roasters on my recent visit to NYC. They have pour overs, and many different varieties of coffees from all over the world with ingredients I would have never thought of (ie:  peanut butter).  I even told them what I want and they educated me a little, thanks for helping Irving Farm.  I also love that they don't have wifi, which means talk to the people, or the person you came with or enjoy a good read.  

The environment is relaxing and hip for sure.  They even have classes you can take to learn the genius of coffee.  I really felt like this was taking coffee roasters to the next level, I loved it all.  

Plus we had breakfast as well, their homemade cheddar and chive biscuit with scrambled egg and my choice of guerye, was a perfect breakfast sandwich (it was huge and filling, look at my photo I added to Irving Farm to see.  But it was very good and for $5.50 you can't beat that price in NYC.

There are many locations throughout the city, so Irving Farm can become your favorite coffee roaster in NYC no matter where you are.  Enjoy, I can't wait to enjoy when I'm back in the city again."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-05-24,5,Great coffee spot on the UWS. Great drinks and food. A substantial amount of seating that always seems to be filled with people getting their coffee fix for the day.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-05-24,5,Great coffee!! Skim cappuccino  would highly recommend. Very silky foam. Comfy seating and nice staff
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-04-22,4,"Service: 5/5
Coffee: 4/5
Food: 5/5

Great spot for a morning/afternoon coffee and snack - I found the espresso to be a lacking in flavor, but it wasn't bad. The lox sandwich was really delicious, and there are a lot of seats to sit and relax and read a book/so some work while enjoying some coffee or food."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-04-18,2,"Sure great coffee and great spot but a 20 minute wait?! 9:30 on a Thursday morning, the line is out the door, they have one check out person. You must be joking. I wanted to grab a muffin with my coffee but once I finally got to order, I was so ticked off by the wait the $5 pastry seemed even more outrageous! Get more staff and you'll be a great spot"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-04-18,5,"I went here on an OKCupid first date many moons ago. While that date was a dud, I did find a new love with Irving Farm Coffee Roasters. They have THE BEST biscuit sandwiches I have ever had, and I love their lattes, a lott-ae. Welcoming staff, buzzy and chic without being overcrowded or kitschy, and the baristas are sharp and friendly while also being modest. I don't get to this location nearly enough, but I really do enjoy it when I have to run errands in the neighborhood."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-04-16,1,"Surly and slow!  I prefer not to go to Starbucks as I prefer to go somewhere privately owned but the hipsters who work here make it really difficult!  

I am sure they have advanced degrees in obscure topics which make it difficult to find employment elsewhere - and I am sure they have other talents such as playing mandolin and pickling - but sadly they are not at all suited to customer service.  

A sad face and bad attitude probably help when performing angsty indie songs, but they suck when serving chocolate chip cookies."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-04-14,5,"Cutest little coffee shop with a great playlist. Beautiful skylit area in the back. Got an Arnold Palmer and Chocolate Walnut cookie.. yum!! Only issue is there's no wifi :( but overall a great atmosphere for hanging out, relaxing, or being productive!"
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-04-14,5,Great food made to order! We had the salmon avocado sandwich which was amazing! We loved the whole experience! Looking forward to breakfast too!
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-04-08,4,Good coffee and great spot to chill on a Sunday afternoon. Can be hard to find a place sometimes though.
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-04-05,4,"One of my favorite coffee shops on the UWS!!! 
Big fan of the their lavender latte, almond milk latte and their cappuccinos.  There are few seats in front abd a decent amount seating in the back. Their baked goods are delicious and the service has always been pleasant."
241,irving-farm-new-york-new-york-10,2018-04-03,5,Delicious and fresh options. Plenty of seating and conveniently located near the American Museum of Natural History. The wait was not bad at all. I loved the coffee and considering I am from WA my expectations are high (and no I am not talking about Starbucks- yuck!)
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2020-06-16,1,"I am so terribly disappointed with Box Kite. This morning I waited with my kids from 7:55am until 8:12am and the barista completely ignored me. I had knocked on the door but he continued to go about his business....which was not to serve customers coffee. This is the second time I've been disappointed. Three weeks ago I walked up at 2:53pm only to be told by the same barista that they were closed. It's a pity because they make a great coffee but I like to support business that appreciate business. And when you're surrounded by other good coffee establishments, I think thats a quick way of losing return business."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2020-05-30,2,Always loved this place but their handling of covid is egregious.  A shared sugar dispenser that everyone touches?  Signing on a touch screen that everyone touches?  Update policies to match pandemic times and of course I'll return my review to its original five stars.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2020-04-09,5,"This coffee shop is the only place in NYC I can drink coffee and it doesn't make me feel sick. Also, I noticed they change their coffee so almost every time I go there their coffee taste different. 

Zeus"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2020-03-26,4,Just walked past Boxkite and saw that they are open right now during the quarantine time. It's 9:45 AM with an open sign and somebody at the register. So if anyone is looking to support local coffee shops this is one that you can go to. I've had their coffee before really good and strong. Pretty fair prices as well!
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2020-02-17,5,"Great neighborhood place with excellent coffee and friendly staff! They have passenger, sey and their own coffee batch brewing each day. The barista is open to chat about coffee sourcing, farmers and relationships. Super interesting! Keep up the great work!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2020-01-11,5,Coffee is second to none. Totally unassuming. Knowledgeable staff that clearly cares about what they are doing and brings integrity to every drink they make.  Great pastries as well.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-11-06,5,Smooth. Delicious. Art. Ordered a latte and a cappuccino. Highly recommend. We'll be back.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-10-12,4,Great for coffee aficionados.  Limited selection and limited space but the coffee is top notch
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-10-06,3,Coffee is ok. Had a latte and was quite disappointed. So many better options in the area. Tap which is a block away has excellent lattes and iced lattes. Blue bottle isn't far and is pretty good too. This is a cute spot but the coffee is lacking
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-09-12,4,"I've had a lot of coffee, and this place has a solid cold brew. Is it the best? No. It's is good, absolutely. 
Place is easy to miss as sign is tough to see, but address is correct."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-07-11,5,Definitely the best coffee place in New York City. I have never come across such Devine coffee in my global travel. It's unfortunate that they don't have any more cafes in the city. It's a must must for all the coffee connoisseurs to at least visit box kite once because you won't be disappointed. Great friendly service
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-06-17,5,"Best coffee shop in NYC, owner is very welcoming. I tried the cappuccino which was the best I never had before!! This place is a little paradise on earth! A must try!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-06-14,5,"Absolutely loved the coffee I got here. Service was wonderful, and it's very clear that the owner and employees really geek out about coffee. 

It's definitely not a place to get work done, but it doesn't pretend to be that. I think some coffee shops try to be a workspace while also setting a high standard for coffee, but kind of fall short on both ends. Box kite knows what it's about - an excellent cup of coffee, either taken to go, or enjoyed at the bar, maybe with a book or a friend."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-05-19,4,"Tiny little shop, on the expensive side (above $5 for most coffees), but good coffee for sure. Very limited choices of pastries but one very good chocolate croissant is enough for me! Kids liked the strawberry ginger muffin. Great service, nice atmosphere."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-24,5,"We wanted a cup of coffee while waiting to meet friends   What we enjoyed was the most delicious cappuccino ever. My wife had two! The owner, Nathan, is a great guy. He offered us free pastries too (it was later in the day). I would recommend this coffee shop to anyone."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-14,5,"A friend of mine recommended Box Kite when I moved to the UWS and I'm SO glad she did! It's my favorite coffee on the UWS. If you're in the area, be sure to check it out!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-14,5,"Fantastic coffee and great service. I came in with my boyfriend the other day and he got a regular coffee and I got a cappuccino. The baristas are very knowledgeable about the coffee from taste, to beans to the best way to serve what you're looking for. You can tell that everyone who works here takes their craft seriously, are able to answer any questions you may have. The shop is small, but cozy, with a no-frills attitude that's clean, comfortable and gets the job done to caffeinate you! They also have lots of available outlets to charge your electronics! We'll be back!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-07,5,Best coffee in Manhattan. Don't bother going to any other shops in the neighborhood if you're on the UWS.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-06,3,"I would have given 5 stars, I think they're coffee is probably great but they don't have decaf but they do have oat milk."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-24,5,"Best coffee on the UWS.  
I walk 12 blocks to come here past six or seven Starbucks and other coffee chains because it is really that good!! 
All the espresso based drinks are phenomenal!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-01,5,Don't let the size of this tiny hallway like coffee shop fool you- great coffee can come from small coffeehouses. I stopped by Blue Kite the other day as I was rushing to Brooklyn- and despite a crowd left within minutes with one of the most delicious cups of coffee I have ever had. How Blue Kite with a staff of one can serve its customers more quickly than that green logo coffee chain with a large staff is truly amazing and makes me think that whoever is running Blue Kite should be put in charge of running bigger things like the MTA. If you love good coffee and appreciate an efficient and friendly staff- Blue Kite is for you. A hidden gem.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-02-21,5,"I admit, I don't drink coffee. However, my family, particularly my dad- and my boyfriend are all coffee snobs. Elliott's a barista himself. We liked Box Kite so much, we went back to order a second round on our first visit, and we ended up going 2 days in a row  . Boyfriend tricked me into oatmilk latte and i LOVED it. 
Tip: its teeny inside, like big coats and backpacks are problematic teeny. So prepare for that. Fret not, this is the upper west side, where there are tons of cute dogs to pet if you're waiting outside:) 

Also, you have to spend sometime looking at the wallpaper! It's super cute and funky! 
Lastly, to complete a fairly random review, I think they sell a few pastries, but seemed to be okay with the guy reading hemingway and munching on levain cookies from around the corner. That compliment Box Kite's coffee so well! They should do a collaboration hah"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2019-01-30,5,"Box Kite is a small coffee gem in the UWS. 

The baristas are friendly and always know what they're doing. My coffee is excellent every time (I drink mostly capuccinos and americanos). 

There's a not a ton of room in here but it's great for a quick caffeine stop or a grab and go."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-12-21,5,They have oat milk!! My favorite non dairy milk! I got an oat milk latte and it was amazing. Coffee is great and so happy they had the vegan option for me. The shop is quite small so you have to look closely for it
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-12-07,4,"The coffee is amazing - espresso and drip. AND they do matcha w bamboo whisk. 5 stars for coffee. 

But PLEASE stop playing heavy metal in the morning. Haven't had coffee yet + aggressive music before 8am is not a good combo. This didn't used to happen! 0 stars for anxiety inducing music."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-12-04,5,"Unlike 99% of the food and drink establishments on the UWS, Box Kite has some personality. Guys behind the counter are personable, real, knowledgeable and did not just get spat out of Soul Cycle. Coffee is expensive, but I imagine their rent is criminally high. I would be down for a darker roast for their normal pour but that's a small quibble."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-11-25,5,"Our go-to place in the UWS for espresso and thankfully it's just down the block from our family's apartment. Nice staff, strong and smooth espresso - we like Cortados. 

We're only in town for 5 days and have already been here 6 times!

The only downside is that they don't make the drinks quickly so there can be a slow moving line at times. But worth the wait!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-10-22,5,"I'm a barista, so I'm very picky with the espresso that cafes use. Before coming to box kite, I hadn't found a cafe with espresso that was high in quality and flavorful. 

Box kite is a very small place, which is fine since most coffee lovers are on the go. It threw me off a little when I saw that their only dairy alternative was oat milk, since most cafes will carry soy, almond, and coconut milk. However, those chose well because steamed almond and coconut milk does not blend well with espresso, and reports are coming out that soy is bad for you. Oat milk replicates the creaminess of whole milk. As a dairy free person, I knew that box kite knew was a good choice. 

I got an oat milk latte, and I was amazed. The oak milk had a great consistency, and it blended so well with their espresso. I wish I was closer to this cafe, as it's the only cafe I've found that has espresso that's better than the espresso at my job. I'm in the city often so I will be back soon."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-10-19,5,"Best coffee in the area! I grab a cappuccino here every morning, never disappointed. 

A little hidden so you have to pay attention to find it, but look for the red neon coffee cup in the window."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-10-16,3,"Tiny little coffee shop that has a counter where you order and three or four bar stools to sit at. We were visiting NYC for a few days this past week, and after visiting a couple of museums, we wanted to take a break and enjoy a coffee/tea while it rained. This is really a grab and go place, but since no one was else was there, we sat on a couple of the bar stools for a few minutes. Decent tea/coffee. Decent service. Nothing bad/nothing particularly special about it. Good place to grab a coffee/tea to go if you're in the area."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-10-14,5,"Nice little coffee shop. There isn't too much seating, but that's part of the allure. I had a cappuccino and it was excellent--and I'm somewhat picky when it comes to coffee. Would definitely recommend, a nice treat!

Prices are obscene, but no stars deducted since they run at the NYC standard (e.g. $5 for a latte). I guess you gotta do what you gotta do to bring in the loot."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-08-15,5,"Impressive coffee plus laid-back staff with a cozy corner to lounge in, what more to do you want? On a serious note, this spot is spot on! The cup of cappuccino is perfectly crafted with the right amount of milk and espresso, and adorned with the usual frothy decoration of a tulip, a heart, abstract art...? I can never figure out what it's supposed to look like but that's not the point. Moving on! I decided to give it another go at the same visit and got their cold brew on my way out, which turns out to be the smoothest cold brew I've had in the city, sans milk. I don't need to have the dairy but there are many places around town that serve up really bad coffee that I either toss out or require milk to drown out the disgusting taste. It's in no reflection of bad coffee at Box Kite that I added the milk, but merely a try with the combo and it certainly held up its balanced flavors. Stars are going way up for BKC, and they're worth it!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-08-12,5,"Standard tiny coffee spot, really just a counter behind a door.

Had the iced cascara latte. OH EM GEE. It was perfect -- just a tad sweet, a lingering taste of the coffee fruit (the cascara). 

The better half got a Matcha Latte. PSA: comes unsweetened."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-08-05,2,"Espresso machine can only make one drink (assuming 2 shots) at a time, meaning if there's a line of 3 people and they order a total of 5 drinks, you will be waiting for the barista to individually make 5 drinks before he/she gets to yours. The espresso is ok and they charge 75 cents for oat milk (don't believe any other non-dairy is available)."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-07-23,3,"V good and ""serious"" coffee place for the neighborhood, where they will not mistake a cortado for a cappuccino etc.   However, the space is small and narrow and in my personal experience there is often only one barista working, and They Are Cool and play heavy-metal so sometimes you have to stand in line, waiting and listening to this.  If you're OK with that then this is a very good local place for a coffee."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-07-14,1,"I was really excited to try this place, as it's a short walk from where I'm staying... But first time at this place--very disappointed  Poor customer service for one--The guy behind the counter looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. I was being polite and friendly, trying to engage in conversation about their coffees, and he had short answers and was curt. I ordered an oat milk latte, which was NOT worth the 5.50. Tasted faintly like espresso. You're much better off sticking to a place like Tobys Estate, where the oat milk lattes are a dollar less AND actually taste like espresso has been poured in it. Definitely won't be going back here"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-06-22,5,hole-in-the-wall gem (more a to-go spot than a cafe) with cute decor and an ever-revolving list of brews. The baristas here know what's up and always get great texture and pours. P.S. they have oat milk.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-05-30,3,"Cute little spot. 

I got a chai latte, which after the first sip, my immediate thought was that it tasted like a Yankee Candle, or maybe Christmas potpourri? Way too fragrant for my taste. My fiancé got a regular latte which was much better. Stick to the coffee :) 

Service was slow but there was only one guy working and a line of like 10 people. Def not his fault but maybe they need more people working?"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-05-26,5,Great coffee and friendly staff. Tucked away on 72nd this tiny shop is a favorite among the locals.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-05-17,4,"Tried their cappuccino and it was a good.. the pastry is 50% off (maybe because they're closing soon at 6pm, i came at 5pm) so tried one of the pastry. Everything is good."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-04-26,5,"Awesome little spot, with excellent service and coffee. It's a great place to just sit and catch your breath for a minute, or grab your coffee on the go. Cool vibe, and highly recommend."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-04-25,2,"Coffee is good but the service is hit or miss. Guy with hoodie and beard is extremely unfriendly and the fact that it says they open at 7am is a blatant lie. Several experiences where I've waited outside for 10-15 mins and still not open. 

Will now be getting coffee elsewhere due to recent experiences."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-04-23,5,"Box Kite is undoubtedly one of my favorite coffee shops in the city. If I lived or worked closer I would come far more often! 
Although the space is quite minimal, it's because nearly everything about Box Kite is focused on the coffee. That's the reason you're there; not to gawk at gratuitously trendy styling, have a place to be seen, or enjoy an avocado toast (delicious as they might be). 
It's the coffee! Everything is dialed in with care and the baristas know what they're doing 100%, actively experimenting while they're at it. You can have a chat and it's wonderful. Always interesting roasters as well, I love it. 
Box Kite could be construed as an upper west side caffeine fix, but it's far more.  Go for the coffee, and also come back for the coffee!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-04-13,3,"Service - 2 stars

Batch brew 1 ($2.50) - 3 stars
Pretty dilute but smooth and not tannic.

Pastry selection was dismal."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-04-01,3,Good coffee and nice decor.   It's a little bit of Brooklyn on the UWS.      Staff are not too friendly which is a shame for a small neighborhood coffee. Bar.   It's super tiny which is part of the fun.   Used to be a hair salon that no one went into.     I wish they would have a few more food options to go with their coffee drinks.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-04-01,5,"Tiny coffee joint, much needed in the caffeine desert that is the low W70s. Service can be a little slow but that's because they treat espresso as a craft, and don't compromise quality for speed unlike many cafes in the city. Eclectic music selection should keep you in a good mood while you wait."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-03-25,5,"Best cappuccino and cortado we had while in Manhattan. The milk was perfectly sweet and the cappuccino was perfectly smooth. Don't be deterred by the line or limited seating, this cup is worth the wait."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-03-24,4,"As small as it gets. Long line, a couple of stools by the counter. Coffee is really good. No pastries at all. Milk options limited as well."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-03-13,5,Cute little hole in the wall coffee shop. We went here on a rainy Tuesday. The barista was very nice and knowledgeable. We got our Dirty Chai Lattes in under 5 minutes.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-03-08,4,"My friends and I love this shop. Never have I seen more care taken in the making of an espresso drink. Really delicious cold brew as well.

The only reason it's not 5 stars is that there's this one guy who's consistently rude. One of the baristas, he might even be the owner, big dark beard and just no sense of how to deal with clientele. 

Everything else is great."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-03-08,5,"Imagine your perfect cappuccino... This place is making it, and with absolute consistency. Right texture, right volume, never bitter. Provides a moment of bliss in the morning.
Tiny spot though, definitely a line that lengthens and contracts throughout the day. Fairly priced for the quality. Always interesting roasters to bring beans home from."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-02-11,5,"What a cute little coffee shop (and I do mean little)! I stopped in here on my way to run some errands and ordered just a simple hot coffee. It was brewed to perfection and what I liked is that they serve oat milk which is much creamier than almond milk. I wouldn't recommend this place as somewhere to go do work as there's only 3-4 chairs lined up against a bar and it's a vary narrow space, but it's a fantastic spot to grab coffee while running around the Upper West Side."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-02-07,5,"I get a cup of 12oz Latte every time I'm in the area.  Love how they measure the grind that goes into making each cup of coffee.  As a result, every cup is a perfect cup of latte...smooth, rich and emotionally satisfying.

P.S. Please bring back the brownies!!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2018-01-09,3,"Yes, the coffee is good, maybe a bit better than Starbucks -- but it's expensive (even for Manhattan), and the servers are rude (even for Manhattan) -- so if you're in the upper west side and need a caffeine hit, this tiny joint will certainly serve you one -- and yes, it will be better than the one you can get at Starbucks -- but I wouldn't go out of my way for it, especially in NYC, where there's seemingly a Starbucks on each and every block."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-12-13,5,"Well brewed coffee, though the bean for the drip wasn't anything amazing. My wife's latte was pretty good.

For those complaining that this isn't ""strong"" Italian espresso... it's not supposed to be. The Italians over-roast their beans, and that's not what third-wave coffee is about."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-11-29,4,"5-star cold brew at a 4-star place. Seriously strong cold brew - definitely gives you a jolt! - with a great taste. Love the simplicity of this hole-in-the-wall shop and the hidden gem factor but I have to reiterate others and admit the baristas are not the friendliest. Absolutely worth it for the coffee if you're in the area! 

For the best cold brew in NYC, follow @nyccoldbrew on Instagram!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-11-29,2,Used to love it here but the last 2 times my espresso was made by the same person using his bare finger to smooth out the grinds that were being used for my drink. Same finger that took my money. He was also rude. Too bad I'll have to find a new go to coffee place.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-11-20,1,"Rudest. Barista. Ever. 
We came to this place on a recommendation, as we are coffee nerds from Columbus, Ohio, but if the vibe is bad, so will be the coffee. We were pumped and excited when we got there, but we obviously ruined the guy's day by coming in with our happiness. I hope he sees this, and that my sincerest apology is communicated for daring to bring happiness into this tiny, cold hole in the wall. 
Dude also slammed the coffee on the counter, and stuck his finger inside the lip of the cup too while preparing it. 
Rudeness aside, that's gross. 
So... I hope the other employees are happier!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-11-05,4,"Stopped here after the NYC marathon and wish I was in better form to fully enjoy and embrace this shop but quite pleased nonetheless. 

Upon entering the shop, it's a stout hallway with bar height shelves on either side that work great for casual leaning, coffee cup placement and chatting. Unfortunately a bit awkwardly sticky and wet from running in the rain, I was sad to see there wasn't a restroom that I could sneak into to change and instead just tried to sequester myself at a far end of the bar. Despite my disheveled state I was warmly greeted and promptly served up a totally DELICIOUS oat milk latte which totally made my day :) 
Sidebar: I was super excited to find that they served oat milk, my preferred foamy drink base, though I did only find this out because there was no soy and I can't do almond milk. I call this a major win.

Looking forward to coming back on a less soggy day for another great cup of joy!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-21,5,"Delicious coffee, served without pretension. Others have said it was expensive, but I didn't think it was any more expensive than Starbucks."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-16,3,"New York is not in short supply of good craft coffee spots. Of course, it's harder to find uptown. I was really excited to find Box Kite. I was even more excited by the look of the small, narrow hole-in-the-wall space! What brought this place down was the slob who made our coffee who was completely soulless and never stopped talking to his friend or girlfriend. Yuck. The coffee was fairly solid if not a degree colder than it should've been and a tad mild. Not bad if I lived or worked nearby."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-10,5,"Best on the UWS. As a craft coffee trained barista I get a bit snobby. Box Kite is a hidden gem in the hood. I walk past 3 other basic-needs joints to come here. Prices are what's expected of a high end coffee spot. Matcha latte is solid, cold brew is on point, still haven't had an espresso but I will be coming here enough to eventually."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-09-30,4,"It's nice that this upper West side express box café is here. The vibe is a little hipster for sure and the music was entirely inappropriate for a Saturday morning with several children under the age of 10 in the store. I don't really need to hear somebody talk about the size of their penis at 8:30 AM much less the discomfort by the idea of six-year-old girls hearing about it. As for my usual order of a small Americano with lots of room did an OK job there was no Crema on top, there was a slight weakness to the Bean but it was not bitter and so I would give it a B+"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-09-18,5,Small little place for some of the best coffee in the city.  I first stopped into Boxkite because I work in the neighborhood.  They certainly know their coffee and have a great cold brew.  The staff is very nice and are up for chatting about whatever. I've gotten to know both Manny and Amy and they always make my early mornings just that tad bit better. 5 stars fo' sho'!
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-09-01,4,"I have not had coffee at more than half a dozen places in NYC but the coffee here was really pretty good.  The space is a little small but was not crowded when I was there.  One of the best features of this place however was the 16 USB power outlets on the wall.  So many of my trips across NYC have been plagued by low phone battery.

So if you want a good cup of coffee and a place to charge your phone while you trek across NYC, give this place a shot!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-07-29,4,This place was tiny and hard to find. However the coffee was good and tea was the same price for any size. Overall reasonably priced and a decent spot. Just don't expect to be able to grab a seat during peak hours.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-07-27,5,"I live for coffee shops. Box Kite is one of those hidden gems that you stumble upon, nearly missing it, as you stroll through your neighborhood.

I usually get a cortado (sometimes with a pastry), sit on one of the few stools available, and read while I enjoy my drink. Their espresso tonic is also one of my favorites!

There's usually only one barista working, so if there's a line it might just take a bit longer than you'd expect, but hey, all good things come to those who wait!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-06-23,4,I accidentally walked past it when I was looking for this place. It's a small cafe with limited seating. I ordered a latte and waffle and they were pretty tasty. Great spot if you wanna grab a drink to go.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-06-16,5,"I've made my way through this spot five or six times in the past month or so. It is tiny, so don't expect to show up and grab a table because there aren't any. There is a thing bar rail and a few stools - outlets are available for your phone, though. 

Personally, I love the 1n1n1. It's espresso, cascara tea, and a mini-latte (super-mini)

They do offer Cascara+tonic which is absolutely perfect for a warm afternoon. 

The barista was knowledgeable about her stuff and she pulled a great espresso shot for me."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-06-05,5,"Tried this coffee shop for the first time over the weekend and it's definitely up there among my favorite lattes (right alongside Rex, Bluestone Lane, Culture Espresso, and Konditori). The ""espresso & milk"" drinks encompass everything from a cappuccino to a flat white to a latte to a macchiato, and you can choose between 4 oz, 8 oz, and 12 oz. My husband picked the 12 oz latte, which was unsurprisingly a bit milkier-tasting, and I went with the 8 oz latte for a deeper espresso flavor that was just as smooth and not at all bitter. On top of the great coffee, the barista was super knowledgeable about how to make the espresso and extremely helpful and friendly, sometimes not seen in similar shops. The space is small if you're planning to linger, but since I was just getting my coffee to go, I didn't mind. They also had some good-sounding chocolate bars on sale, but I wish the price had been more clearly advertised. Either way, I will be returning for sure!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-04-04,5,"Of my two favorite coffee shops this hails as numero uno. The service is impeccable and the brews are made to perfection. The coffee grounds crushed beautiful, seeped at the right time and temperature, and the product is literally caffeinated heaven. 

Very limited seating is the only issue but this is a place to enjoy coffee, not spend countless hours surrounded by college students hogging the world's cyber power. 

Love that a small glass of sparkling water was served with the espresso - that's how it's done right, Milano style.

Perfect little place - hope this one doesn't close down!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-03-29,3,Was in the area and wanted to get good coffee and I found this one on Yelp. I got the americano and it was okay. I honestly didnt even finish it. I like my coffee nice and strong but this was just didn't cut it for me.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-03-27,5,Quaint little place. Loved the atmosphere and the coffee. They were able to make me a cortado even though it's not on the menu and it was perfect. They also have conveniently placed USB wall plugs  in the sitting area.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-03-24,5,"Super impressed! The espresso with milk (triple) - like a latte. It's delish! Notes of toasted nuts, smooth, not bitter at all, one of the best I've had! Also, barista is knowledgeable, nice, and gave me a sip of the cascara tea because I was debating on purchasing a bag. It was yum, so I got a bag to make at home in AZ. Small, clean space. Small storefront, so don't miss it!"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-03-14,4,"Incredibly nice service! My friend and I are aggressive seat hawks (side note: seating is limited, maybe 5 spots tops?) and when we left our spot in line to claim a seat the guy at the cashier actually saved it for us. Was he enabling us? Maybe... but 5 stars for service. Instead of just saying no when I asked if they had iced tea (they don't) he also said he could brew tea and ice it, which I appreciated.

Oh they also make a fantastic iced chai. I know they're famous for their coffee, but the iced chai was spicy and rich but not overly sweet. It's rare to find a good iced chai at a coffee shop (most come from the box and are way too saccharine) so I was pleasantly surprised at theirs :)"
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-03-06,5,Non-pretentious elite coffee. Def a top 3 in the city and my personal fav.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-03-05,1,"Asked for a pourover, was told ""I can't make that, I'm all alone and it's our busiest day"".... 3 other people in the cafe, only 1 waiting on line behind me... after I waited about 5-6 minutes for 2 very methodically made espressos in front of me. Sat around for 20 minutes after getting a batch brew, maybe 12 people came through? Sorry but that's just poor service especially for a coffee shop that is actually into quality. Disappointed."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-02-06,5,"I had my first cascara latte at Starbucks. Prior to that, I had only heard of the fruit and its reputation as the ""poor man's coffee."" Upon first sip of the CL at Starbucks which cost a whopping $5, my instinct was to spit out the cloying sweetness and curse at such blatant bastardization. But I had the drink again at Box Kite yesterday, along with a teddybear financier from Colson. Although I am certain that Bolivians do not drink this fruit with so much milk or latte art, the tender, silky, and subtle sweetness in a cup completely floored me."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-01-15,4,"Super tiny space that you can easillyyyy miss the entrance as you're passing on the street. They have delicious coffee and a good selection of teas as well. There's a counter space for seating, but definitely not a place I would come to do work. The baristas are really friendly and the interior is unique. If you simply want a grab and go coffee, this place is your stop. It is a little pricey though. I paid $4.50 for my cappuccino."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2017-01-07,4,"Box Kite coffee is small, but you're gonna get a good cup of coffee. This area in particular has no lack of coffee places, but Box Kite is likely the best. For that pleasure, you'll pay a higher price, but it all depends on your coffee preference. 

Note Box Kite is small and although it has a few seats at a side bar, you probably won't want to drink it inside. This is not where you go to chat with a friend or do work; this is a 'get some coffee and go' type of place."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-12-24,4,Very tiny coffee shop but it was the perfect stop to get an afternoon coffee fix after walking around all afternoon. I had an almond milk cafe au lait which was delicious. My brother had a Tokyo Fog which was their take on a London fog and he really enjoyed. It was a bit pricey for the size of the drinks and unfortunately they do upcharge for non dairy milk. But the barista was very friendly and it was a pleasant pit stop in NY. They have a punch card to earn a free drink as well.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-12-22,5,One of the best cafes I've ever been to -- rivals giants like Stumptown and Intelligentsia. Try the espresso tonic; you won't regret it.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-11-18,5,So glad we found this gem! Adorable little coffee joint with friendly staff who can whip up anything your heart desires. Try it!!! Look hard cuz it's easy to miss.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-11-12,5,"Amazing experience! If you are already sick of Starbucks, this place is a must! The Asian guy behind the counter is very knowledgable. I really enjoy the conversation with him. Don't hesitate. Just walk in. Grad a coffee and enjoy the afternoon."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-11-11,5,"Not a coffee connoisseur. I usually just drink Americanos. The guy behind the counter was very nice. I ordered an espresso black and he poured the hot water in the cup in front of me and told me to say when. Again, not a connoisseur, but it tasted good to me. Sometimes Starbucks will have a nasty burnt taste. Overall, great service and good coffee. It's a pretty cute and quaint little store too. Would come again."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-10-27,5,Excellent addition to the neighborhood. The UWS desperately needed some third-wave coffee action and Box Kite more than suffices. Cool small shop and perfect drinks. FYI house brew only until 2pm.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-10-13,3,"I expected no less than excellent coffee from a place that sells just that, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.
Coffee was just ok, and one of our mugs was served with coffee spilled all over. Very unprofessional. 
The general experience wasn't great either. Barista was not welcoming at all and loud Metal is not quite my choice of music first thing in the morning...
Full of unmet potential."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-09-25,5,White Matcha Latte. Yes! I love it and highly recommend if you're a matcha fan or just now starting to add it to your repertoire. To be clear - this latte is literally green and super delicious.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-09-13,3,"After reading about this being a good coffee spot on the upper west side, I decided to give it a shot on the way to work. Look carefully when you walking down 72nd street to find it; I almost walked right by it. It's a small, nondescript entrance that is presently under scaffolding. It is quite cute and very cozy inside. This tiny coffee shop offers the usual coffee shop fare as well as matcha, which I appreciated. More coffee shops could have matcha. I ordered an almond milk latte and was not disappointed. Pretty good coffee was used, but it did have a slightly bitter after taste. It didn't completely turn it off but it wasn't as smooth as I like my lattes. They did not have unsweetened almond milk, which is alright but I find the almond milk tends to leave a saccharine like after taste. Overall, the coffee was enjoyable but not the best i've ever had in the city."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-09-12,4,"I'm not a coffee aficionado by any means, but I really enjoyed their expresso and tonic.  It tasted a bit sour on the first sip, but didn't have any unpleasant aftertaste that you sometimes get from coffee.  It went down deliciously with a scone.  They have a tiny 5-seat bar seating area, but very well equipped with USB chargers (no regular plugs).  I would come back again to try their regular coffee."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-08-29,4,"Delicious coffee! Cozy little nook of a place with a bench that could fit two children or one adult (with a little room to spare), plus seating along a narrow counter on one wall. Lots of USB charging spots. I was able to get some good work done here in an hour and a half, and would come back."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-08-18,5,This place knows how to make legit espresso! And the staff are super friendly. Patronize them!
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-08-02,5,Try to espresso and tonic!!  Great place for a quick cofee.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-07-28,5,"Favorite neighborhood coffee shop! You can tell that they really take pride in serving great coffee. After only a couple of visits the barista rememebered me and what I order. They have a limited menu but i guess a real coffee enthusiast isn't going to be interested in a bunch of ice-blended ""shakes"" anyway. Great place for awesome, no-frills gourmet coffee."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-07-21,4,"This is a must if you can find the tiny space. Even with more choices in the neighborhood, I find this one of the best when I've visiting this part of New York. Love the caramel notes of the iced americano."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-07-17,3,"I don't know - I judge a place by if I have to add sugar to the coffee either because it's so bitter or the milk doesn't make it.  This place was aight.  Didn't HAVE to add sugar to my cappuccino, but it was a bit on the bitter side."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-06-26,3,First off I passed right by this and didn't see it. There's no sign with the name on it but the name was on the door which is how I noticed it. It is also soooo tiny and small but cute. I had the cold brew wasn't anything special but did the job
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-06-24,3,The coffee was really good.  So it was nice to stop and have a coffee.  My wife didn't want to stay when she came in and they were blasting heavy metal.  Like death metal.  Haha.  I liked it.  The barista wasn't really helpful as he drank his beer and made coffee.  But the coffee was good.
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-06-09,1,"Rude service! the waiter who works here doesn't have any idea how to properly treat customers - after asking for an extra hot coffee, he instead gave me one that was lukewarm, and only wanted to heat it up in this one special occasion 'because usually they never do so'. avoid at all costs."
242,box-kite-coffee-new-york-4,2016-06-07,5,"Small spot, friendly barista, and amazing espresso. This is a must visit shop if you're in NYC"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-07-04,5,"My 4th of July turned awesome jst now as I discovered Quaraná sold at Tap
Super friendly staff as always"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-05-30,5,Their açaí bowls are truly the best. Had their amazing wraps too. We had a vegetable wrap and the mushroom wrap. The food is delicious and very friendly service.
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-05-21,1,"Just ordered two tapiocas (""taps"") using Uber Eats but its ""Help"" funcionality is not working, so decided to write a review here. Order was over an hour late (according to the delivery guy because the restaurant asked him to deliver three orders in totally different places). Suffice to say that the taps arrived cold and worse than that, one of them came without the extras I ordered. Being Brazilian (and a fan of taps), its a double disappontment. Tried to contact the restaurant without success."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-05-09,4,It's a little slow in service but the Brazilian soft truffles and moist chocolate cake compensated for the delay. I will try their crepes at another time. I like their grab n go dessert stand.
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-03-29,5,"Amazing, authentic Brazilian acai bowls that are legit massive (probably not a good healthy move to eat the full one like I did, yolo amirite?) and tapioca crepes for all the gluten free ppl out in these streets. Such a great vibe for getting work done too!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-02-27,3,I'm a huge fan of acai bowls and I was looking forward to this one but because of the gluten free granola ect but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The taste just wasn't as great not the texture. Also for the price it's very small.
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-02-26,2,"Completely inedible. I like crepes. I like gluten free food. But apparently the two cannot yet be combined, or at least not in the way this place does it. Tried 3 different crepes, both sweet and savory, no go on all. I love the concept and really wanted to like it. Yelp let me down this time!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-02-22,5,"Gosh I just love this place. Everyone is super nice and accommodating. I haven't experimented too much with their menu, as I mainly get their acai bowls as a post-workout treat. I do not eat gluten or dairy, and their bowls work great for me and do not upset my stomach. They come in various sizes, and while they're a bit pricey, I'd say they're worth it. I've tried many other acai bowls throughout the city, and these are by far my favorite!!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-02-22,3,"I loved Tap NYC and came weekly for an acai bowl. However, they've since changed the acai recipe and now it's overly sweet and artificial. I'm so disappointed! I've really tried to like the new recipe (that comes pre-prepared out of a machine similar to soft serve ice cream), but it's so artificial I can't get through it. 
The cheese bread is truly delicious, but I am so disappointed in this change to the acai bowl."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-02-02,4,"Clean and chic little store. Our barista was absolutely amazing, after learning that my main goal of having a cup coffee is to photograph beautiful latte art, he went out of his way to carefully craft two distint and perfect tree designs on top of our lattes. High five to the best customer services!!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-02-02,5,"This is the best açaí bowl in the city. They don't use Sambazon like everyone else, that's an açaí blend. They use real açaí and sweeten it with guarana. The toppings are great, the chia cakes together and makes for a chewy pudding, and the granola and nuts are also great. Which says nothing about the cheese bread, but the açaí bowls are truly impressive. Get the Monster Açaí Bowl."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-01-24,4,"This place is delicious with a ton of gluten-free options! I was skeptical of a tapioca crepe at first, but the crunchy texture is very tasty, and the fillings are awesome. I recommend the cauliflower crepe, and mushroom. My only gripe is that they don't have a bathroom."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-01-16,3,Great coffee and nice staff. I'm giving 3 stars because they don't have a fucking bathroom for paying customers. Why would you do this?
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-01-13,4,"Can I just say that this place is a haven for us gluten free folks. I got the veggie wrapioca(tapioca flour and organic eggs) and a pao de quiejo(cheese bread). The cheese bread was amazing, nice and soft with the right amount of flavor and chewiness. The veggie wrapioca was OK tbh, I wasn't swept off the floor but it did its job. One thing is that its kind of pricey particularly the cheese bread ($3) for the size. Other than that I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for Brazilian food, plus the ambiance inside of the cafe is great (think low music, brightly lit, etc.)"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2020-01-08,1,"Overpriced! This place is grossly overpriced. I ordered a tapioca crepe with Caprese filling, and with the $15 price tag, I was expecting something to blow me away if not at least fill me up. Although the crepe looked cute, I did not like the taste (it was too starchy for my liking), but the portion size was horrendous. I am not a heavy eater by any means, but after eating a crepe and one of their cheese puffs, I was still hungry. I could have bought a similar Caprese sandwich for half the price, which would have not only tasted better but would have also filled me up.

I think Tap is trying to create a fad with the tapioca crepe but not sure how that will work without any returning customers. I can see people trying to it just to see what it is but never coming back again. At least that is where I am. I would have given two stars, but I am giving one star because of the outrageous price and also to offset the high rating they have (I have no idea why)."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-12-31,5,"Good place for people with food allergies. My friend is allergic to basically everything under the sun and they were able to accommodate her. I got the grass fed steak crepe and it was delicious, filling and affordable. Also, major points for not using plastic cutlery (they use wooden utensils.) Highly recommend!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-12-09,2,TAP has changed a lot since they first opened a few years ago. Don't order takeout. Orders are typically incorrect and inconsistent.
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-12-06,5,"Really great place for someone with Celiac. I have tried their savory and sweet crepes, cheese bread and cheese bread sandwiches. All taste amazing. Wish they had a location downtown near financial center."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-12-03,3,"Place is ok. Their competitive edge is their tapioca crepe, very unique. However I tried them and found them expensive for the size and nothing out of this world. Tasted just ok. The customer service was nice, lady added honey to my friend's tea with a smile. However this is a cafe/coffee shop place and has no customer restroom, I thought that's a really inconvenient feature. The decor is nice, everything is orange colored theme and vibrant, there's a nice green plant wall as well. One plus was outdoor seating and multiple outlets for laptop or phone charging use inside. Place also has WiFi. I don't think I will return unfortunately due to lack of mentioned amenities. Perhaps this place is good for a quick coffee with a friend. They offer matcha drinks."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-12-03,5,"Searched gluten free restaurants on the upper west side and Tap NYC popped up. I'm so happy that it did, because I'm so obsessed with this place. I have celiac, so the struggle to find gluten free is real, even in the NYC. I had the cheesy jalapeño bread and the mushroom mix crepe. It was absolutely delicious, so inventive, and the staff was super friendly. I'm only in town for 2 days, and I'm definitely coming back."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-11-17,2,"Ok. So, the Coffee is good. The atmosphere is good. My problem Was that the crepes.... were not very good. It's tapioca based crepe, which I'm like ""sure, that will be fine"". The problem is it's not tapioca flour......it's pure tapioca starch. Like whole tapioca kernels is what your crepe is made up of. It's not good.  Not even remotely good.  Go for the coffee or whatever, but sadly, their main premise just isn't good. My opinion only.  Some may like it."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-11-08,4,"Oat Milk Latte was not the best, I recommend sticking to their food. That's where they really shine. 

The wrapioca is awesome and I usually recommend it to people who want a more hearty option. The batter is made with tapioca flour and eggs and lasts with you for a while. 

My go-to was a lox and cream cheese crepe but they recently replaced it with a lox and avocado crepe, which I'm excited to try! The lox cream cheese crepe was a delicious GF alternative to a lox bagel. 

Their mushroom mix has some truffle oil on it which really brings everything together. Overall so good!

No bathroom but they do have WiFi."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-10-31,2,"Truly awful iced matcha - flavorless and bland, with undissolved clumps of powder"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-10-19,4,"The Brazilian tapioca is very different from the taiwanese tapioca. This crepe was very unique but the tapioca by itself doesn't taste like anything. I liked the crepe as a mid-meal snack. 

The acai however was extremely sweet!! It's made with fruit juice instead of almond milk. If you like juices, you'll enjoy this acai bowl; otherwise stick to the crepes. 

I don't know if this tapioca will become the next fad, but for what it's worth it was worth a try."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-10-08,5,"Best Açaí I have ever tried (I had some decent and bad ones) and now my new favorite dish is tapioca crepe. 
Great costumer service on the top of delicious food which worth what it cost."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-10-03,1,I used to love this place. Smh I looked over paying a RIDICULOUS amount for a açaí bowl but I liked how rich the bowl taste. I walked over at 8am (the time they are supposed to be open) on the dot and the place was closed. I was confused because I see two guys walking around behind the counter. I figured they probably came late. So I went to buy water else where and came back and they were still chit chatting with the door still locked and the chairs still on top of the table. I'm knocking and I know they hear me and they are fully ignoring me. Smfh absolutely disrespectful. Never spending a dollar in that establishment.
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-09-15,1,"Specifically asked for an order with certain ingredients left out. When I wanted to confirm they were left out, the cashier tried to argue that is not what I ordered. What makes it worse is the other staff tried to convince me to take the order as is saying I can just remove it when I eat. Had to keep firm ground for them to redo the order. When they handed it off in a very rude demeanor, I had already lost my appetite."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-09-05,2,"I've only eaten here once. The food was interesting and good, although my mushroom wrap could have had more filling. But to my mind, the prices are way out of line. I'd say the food was expensive even if it cost 50% less. I'm not likely to return. And I thought it was illegal to not have a rest room for customers if you can seat 20 people, which TAP certainly can if you count the tables outside."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-08-25,5,"as someone who lived in Brazil for years and married a Brazilian wife who can cook like no other, I always avoid Brazilian restaurants as I can be very critical. I also have Tapioca at home all the time.
This place rocks, the carnitas, anytime, Caprese and  Mushroom mix are amazing. Cheese bread is decent too and staff quite nice."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-08-17,4,The lox cream cheese crepe tasted delicious!! Friendly staff as well. Not giving five stars only because there is no public restroom for customers. Would be a perfect place to get some work done if they did.
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-08-14,5,Amazing Real acaï bowl with really good crunchy homemade granola full of nuts and not only oats!! Good coffee as well ! We tried different places for acaï we are acaï lovers and it's the best
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-08-12,1,"Shows in all apps tha they open at 8:00am, walked there to grab something for breakfast before work and was such a waste of time. They were not open, i could see the workers inside, I called them at the door, just to ask something and the guy that was on the cashier was stupid!
He didn't move himself and just shouted from inside: what do you want??
Ridiculous, wast of time"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-08-10,3,The Acai is delicious but overpriced. The monster size is a huge cup but only half filled with Acai and toppings (completely different from the picture that is
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-08-06,5,"Excellent coffee (with oat milk) and I don't know what those tapioca cheese ball things are but they are AMAZING!!!  Great place for coffee and a snack, I definitely will return."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-08-04,3,"Chill atmosphere with louder music than similar places.  I'm not crazy about the food here, but maybe tapioca crepes are just a little too strange for me.  Looks like styrofoam and tastes cardboard-like.  Maybe if you really are focused on it being healthy, it'll taste better.  I've had the carnitas and eggs benedict.  The fillings tasted just fine, but are overwhelmed by the crepe.  Whenever I come, it's because I'm not craving any of the more common foods and want to eat slightly healthier.  Otherwise, would only come back for the iced latte with oat milk, which was delicious.  The paper straw won't survive a short meal though so drink it fast."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-07-17,3,"If you are expecting normal crepes, this is not the place for you. HOWEVER- if you are gluten free or looking for a unique tapioca sandwich style crepe experience, give it a try.."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-07-06,4,The food is delicious. My only complaint is that it is very pricy. The crepes and cheese bread are great!
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-06-30,4,Lovely store for a quick health bite while exploring the city! Customer service was great and food was delicious! Thank you!
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-06-24,4,"Exciting new option in the neighborhood, the food is great with original healthy options. Although both times I had the meat crepe(chicken or steak) I felt the meat was under seasoned and mushy(both were served in a shredded style. Prefer the veggie options"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-06-23,4,"Stroller accesible but, no restrooms. I LOVE tap. The pai de queijo is to die for. The coffee is fantastic (great baristas!!) and everyone here is just so friendly! Can we add the restroom guys? It would be one of my favorite places then! #LifeWithKids #TheyAlwaysNeedaRestroom"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-06-23,5,Very friendly staff and the food is fresh and delicious. I tried the Mushroom Mix Tapioca Crepe which was flavorful and the perfect amount of food for a light lunch. Will absolutely return to try the Cheese Bread and Acai Bowl. They are 100% gluten-free so definitely will bring my friend who is gluten-free here.
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-06-18,4,"To everyone and anyone out there looking for GF food...come here and don't look back. I LOVE my friends at TAP NYC. I make the trip from DC to hit up all my fav GF places and this is at the top. Not only are their crepes delicious and flavorful, but they have amazing cheese bread and acai bowls. The menu is simple yet still plentiful. The staff is kind and friendly.I have had many different crepes and the caprese is one of my favorites. Then again, you can never go wrong with Nutella. Another thing i love about this place is their coffee.  They also love the plant and offer eco-friendly utensils.

The only reason I take one star off is the lack of a restroom. I know its NYC and it can get crazy but coming in.... to have coffee and crepes, it would be nice to have a place to wash your hands and powder your nose. Will always be back when I am in town. Shout out to the entire team here!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-06-15,4,"Delicious Acai, cheese bread, etc. For food, five stars, but the place has no bathrooms. It is nice and big enough with enough seating inside and outside but no bathroom."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-06-15,3,"Food is delicious. I've been here many times. 
Service is good. Some employers are friendlier and more polite than others.
No bathrooms so this is definitely not a place to hangout for long. 
Never had any issue other than today.
I heard one of the guys who make the food yelling at another employer calling him ""viado"" which is a way of calling another person gay in Portuguese. He was clearly trying to be funny as he went on and on with his ""joke"". But it's very offensive an unacceptable having this kind of behavior in a business. It's very non sense and disrespectful."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-06-12,2,"I cannot believe the Baby Açai Bowl is $9!.. 
9 bucks for a cup smaller than a cocktail in a club - and with JUST granola.
I at least wish it met my expectations taste-wise, but alas! One of the worst açai bowls I have Ever tried."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-06-07,4,"Great place to do work. Good vibes and better music.  Props to whoever was being DJ. They had a mix of Queen, The Who, AC/DC and more! I just had some tea to drink"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-06-04,2,Not a great experience here. I had their gluten free crepe with lox cream cheese and first off it was way overpriced at $15. The crepe tasted like cardboard. I added a star because the filling was ok.
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-05-26,2,"I've passed this place a few times and was intrigued. Finally, with a free morning on my hands, I ordered 2 tapioca crepes. Not what was I was hoping for. The one- and two-star reviews sprinkled below describing the crepes as reminiscent of laundry detergent, styrofoam, or paint chips aren't far off.   Maybe they are an acquired taste.  When I read tapioca, I was thinking of a light, spongy pancake.  I found the crepes dry and tasteless, not helped by the almond/banana or vegetable/avacado fillings.  I would discount the many glowing five-star tapioca crepe reviews below. I'm guessing they speak more to the cafe's reputation-management abilities than cooking skills.
  Having said that, I plan to go back and order something else. I'm gluten-free and would love some nice good breakfast options.  I would recommend spending $15 to decide for yourself. Then leave a review here."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-05-12,4,"Ordered the lox crepe and the carnitas crepe. I LOVED the crepe itself and the texture. It is very unique and its not something that you could create at home or even buy in a grocery store. It is soft like any sweet crepe you would imagine, but it has a spongy texture. Second, the presentation was very beautiful. Definitely make sure to look through the pictures of it on yelp. Lastly, any of the combinations posted on the menu could be in a bagel, but the crepe is so light and airy. I think of it as a lighter alternative to a bagel. 

I personally would love to eat this on the daily, but it cost me roughly $30 for two crepes. The carnitas crepe came about to around $13.75 and the lox is roughly $11. I didn't order any drinks. It could be priced a bit more reasonably as it sells itself more as a quick service place. 

Lastly the service staff were very polite and professional. They were smiling and my food was served pretty fast."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-05-03,3,"Horrors! They no longer have the 'Vegan,' my favorite crepe. They now have something called the 'Veggie,' which looks similar ingredients-wise but I assume has some dairy product, thereby forcing the name change. Of course my assumption could be wrong I realize."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-04-30,4,"Everything in this place is gluten free! How amazing is that. I had the veggie cassava crepe with vegan cheese! I also got a banana muffin and my hubby got the chocolate carrot cakes! Talk about delicious 

The reason this place loses a star is because there is no public bathroom. Booo, a real bummer, especially if you traveled far to get to this place. You may want to make your ""Employee Bathroom only"" for paying customers as well. 

Average customer service. 

I would give it a 3.75"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-04-29,5,this place is super low key but i have always loved everything that i've eaten from tap. i recommend the mushroom mix wrapioca and don't forget to get their pao de quiejo (if you like kind of sticky/mochi-like consistency plus cheese.)
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-04-28,4,"Cute and casual Cafe at UWS... It's a total walk in kind of place... Place your order, pick a seat and enjoy.
I love that they have phone charge points near every seating.. that's very considerate of them.
The servers at the counter are nice and warm.. the guy taking my order allowed me time to decide, offer suggestions and not rush me into placing my order. Much appreciated considering that's a rarity in this city.
U
I ordered lox cream cheese wrapioca and an Americano.. the food is good but a bit pricey for a casual cafe. I paid like 21 dollars (including tip) for that.
So basically they have options of either tapioca crepe or wrapioca (which is gluten free and has egg in it) you can also get acai berry bowl (organic and regular) and other breakfast options.
A bit over priced but a nice place to visit once in a while."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-04-23,3,"The guy ringing me up was all smiles, but the woman making my matcha cappuccino couldn't have been bothered to acknowledge me or smile. I usually don't care too much about this, but the difference was stark.

Definitely get the Brazilian cheese bread. It was spot on!

No bathroom for customers. That's a bummer."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-04-14,4,"This cafe is a great place to stop and take a little break from walking around the city and to do some people watching. I like the concept of this place and how they keep the packaging simple and recyclable. 

I didn't try any food but the drinks were okay. The iced Americano was strong and straight to the point. The Chai latte was leaning more towards the milky side and not enough Chai in my opinion. Prices are decent for the area. They have indoor seating and outdoor. 

The only tidbit I have to add is to switch out the paper straws with biodegradable ones. The paper straws are super cute and go with the color scheme of the brand, but not very practical as it eventually soaks up the liquid and makes it difficult to drink. 

Also, there is unfortunately no public restroom for customers."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-03-17,3,Ordered from here recently and was not impressed. I had a chicken crepe with cream cheese and tomatoes. The crepe also had mozzarella on it which ruined the dish because it tasted rubbery and would have been much better without it. The overall flavor was good but the execution of this item was not great. I perhaps would give it another try and order something different as the other menu offerings looked tasty.
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-03-12,4,"We were exploring the museums and decided to stop for something light for lunch so stumbled across Tap.  I had never really come across anything like this before - crepes made of tapioca making them lighter and naturally gluten free.

They have a variety of both sweet and savory options and the crepe itself has a unique texture that is crispy and light. The kids went with sweet - a Nutella and a caramel / cheese concoction that as weird as it sounds, worked and was delicious. Our table favorite was my pick - a caprese version and my husband got the carnitas which was also enjoyed.

They have a selection of fresh juices,kombucha , matcha and coffee type drinks to go with your crepes. The only negative was I felt the price regardless of this being NYC was a little steep for what you get thought this can be brought  down if you go with their specials which are reasonable.

Overall very unique and delicious lunch!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-03-09,5,"Fave: Wrapioca with housemade steak, tomatoes, onions, arugula

Pros: their housemade chicken and steak are very juicy and flavorful; the food is very filling; I love the Parmesan crust; I appreciate the paper containers and wooden cutlery

Cons: tapioca can be heavy; the crepes are bit thick (I prefer the thinner  wrap); the fancy ribbons and customized delivery bags - I'd rather have cheaper food prices and no delivery charge"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-03-04,5,"I'm Brazilian so I love tapiocas and I'm happy to report that TAP is awesome!
Great option for lunch, specially if paired with açaí :)"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-02-16,4,I like it here and I like that everything is gluten free. It's not over the top amazing but it's very good and I even bought the crepe mix to make at home. Staff is very nice but no bathroom.
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-01-26,4,"For the past couple years or so, I've been lusting after Jeff O.'s gorgeous Upper West Side food pics.  Seeing the neighborhood's culinary scene through his lens made me want to rethink my entire ""the Upper West Side sucks for food"" philosophy. Ultimately, I could no longer resist.  I contacted the man himself and he was kind enough to give me a list of his favorite haunts to help me plan a mini food crawl in the area. So Jeff O., this one's for you:

The thing to get here is definitely a tapioca crepe.  LOVED its uniquely chewy cum crispy texture!  A lot.  I think I'd get a different filling next time, though.  Wasn't that crazy about my goat cheese, arugula and mushroom pick.  The cheese totally overwhelmed the veggies and it was all I could taste. Nonetheless, this was so different in the best of ways.

Also tried some pao de queijo, aka Brazilian cheese bread, and liked this, too.  Maybe not as airy as what I've encountered elsewhere, but packed with flavor. Experienced a bit of sticker shock with the 2 for $5 price, but then, am used to getting this at random little storefronts in Newark, New Jersey.  

Both of these are gluten-free by definition, in case that's a selling point for you.  

This fast casual cafe offers minimal seating and fwiw, sells their pao de queijo frozen to reheat at home.  Also spotted brigadeiros, Brazilian condensed milk truffle-like treats, should you be in the mood for something sweet."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-01-10,4,"This place has some of the best matcha I've been able to find on the Upper West Side! It's not too sweet, which for me is usually the issue. They offer mill substitutes as well. The space is trendy, with little succulents at every table. It also has plenty of seating and the wifi works, so it's a good spot to get some work done."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-01-07,4,Gluten free tapioca take out and sit down. Pick up food at counter. Will try it again.
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2019-01-06,4,"This place is nice, clean, and good atmosphere to chill and do some work on your laptop. The chai latte is really good."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-12-30,4,"*leaning more towards 3.5*

I am a fan of trying new, interesting food items, so when I read that this place sold gluten free tapioca crepes I figured I needed to go give them a shot. I will admit, it looks like a styrofoam mess, but after the initial ""what the..."" shock it's surprisingly good. I had the crepe with lox; delicious and with a good amount of lox inside. I have gone back to try others, but fancy the lox crepe the most. 

I tried both their matcha and latte, and I didn't like how the made the matcha (not enough matcha so it essentially tastes like milk -- not acceptable for the cost). The latte was pretty good; the coffee was smooth and creamy. 

Their açaí bowls are not something I would ever get again. They pre-make them, there is little at all for toppings, and the consistency is not at all what I am used to (I am a Californian which means I eat these an unhealthy amount when I am back home, but I do live in NYC now). I tried this twice, hoping the first time was a fluke, but, nope. Also, the cost for what you get is just not worth it. There is another place on the UWS which much better açaí bowls (Broadway and 86th). 

I do return for the lox crepes and lattes on occasion now, the rest I would suggest to be careful with."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-12-30,4,"While I like this place generally, it's a bit frustrating that basic ingredients are missing by midday. For example, they've run out of strawberries, don't have acai bowls or 2% milk for coffee. It's happened multiple times I've come here and am always puzzled by this."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-11-26,5,"If you are looking for delicious unsweetened matcha lattes, then definitely visit this cafe! I consider myself a connoisseur of matcha since I've tried most matcha cafes in NYC and have ordered several varieties online.  
I didn't try their tapas but will have to come back again!  Good variety of fruit smoothies too!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-11-25,4,"I enjoy the food, but please provide a restroom to customers. It was available a few months ago. I don't know why it changed."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-11-19,5,"Love this place ! Their lunch menu is $13+tax which is a crepe, side salad and a juice. Will definitely come here again and try all the other crepes :)"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-11-17,1,"Horrible delivery experience! TWICE!! First time I got someone else's food and second time after waiting and checking with the restaurant for TWO HOURS, food never came! DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!!!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-11-14,3,"OK... So I wish you could give half stars because I would've given a 3 1/2. I had a vegan crêpe & the stuff inside the crêpe
Was fine... Zucchini avocado Etc but personally I was not fond of the rough texture and the consistency of the tapioca crêpe. Perhaps it's an acquired taste. The price seems a little expensive but with the lunch special you get a juice and a side salad so that sort of makes it reasonable. A fresh juice alone  is probably five or six dollars in most places. I would get the dressing on the side if possible next time as it was way too much for me. I don't like a salad that needs swimming lessons. I also wasn't thrilled with the fact they don't have a bathroom. Didn't even know this was legal except I guess they have a sink which gets around the regulations."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-11-01,4,"Love this place and the food and the people but disappointed you removed the bathroom - customer centricity guys. I'm sure it was a pain to manage but restaurants where food takes a while to make and enjoy...needs a bathroom. Plus people like to hangout here! Which ""was"" a great perk."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-10-29,5,"I am obsessed with their Acai bowl and tapioca crepes. The Acai bowl is delicious and not too sweet. The crepe was crusted by parm and was crunchy and chewy at the same time - I had the one with avocado, mushrooms & arugula. Have been here twice in a week much to the detriment of my wallet."

Came here to escape the rain and get some work done w free wifi.
Eric the barista is terrific!
He got me an almond milk off menu & was reasonably priced!
Atmosphere clean and serene.
Would be happy to chill here a while.
Menu looks delish & healthy. Saw some customers eating an açaí bowl - can't wait to try.
Mushroom mix is popular too.
They have gluten free!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-10-04,5,"Great place! Probably the best tapioca I ever had (even in Brazil), vegetarian/vegan friendly also gluten free. The cheese bread is made in house and it also worth it, friendly staff."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-09-17,4,"Cute spot on the UWS! I came with a friend on a Sunday at 1pm and it wasn't a problem getting a table. (You order at the counter and seat yourselves.) Most of the tables only seat 2, though, so bringing a group in might be tough.

First impression of the tapioca crepes: these look like styrofoam! But are thankfully much tastier. They're chewy with a slight crunch, and somewhat airy. 

I ordered the Eggs Benedict crepe. Overall it wasn't bad, but 1) the portion size was pretty small, and 2) the egg is fried, not poached. (I suppose a poached egg would probably be logistically difficult. But the brunch fiend in me was still a bit disappointed.)

My friend got the carnitas, which was slightly larger than my crepe, but still rather small of a portion in my opinion.

I wouldn't say tapioca crepes are my new go-to, but they're definitely worth a try - and a nice gluten-free option!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-08-14,1,"This place does not have a bathroom for customers.  Why?  Because they would have to remodel it to make it wheelchair compliant.  Their solution is to not offer a bathroom to anyone!  My solution?  Eat elsewhere.   Shame on you, Tap NYC."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-07-28,5,"I don't like GF food but I like this place!  I had the anytime and my daughter had the Pollo.

Not sure how this is even legal in NYC-perhaps an email to the health department is in order.

243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-06-24,4,"Disclaimer: I'm not a fan of crepes. I think they're a gimmicky, overrated tease that lack everything that's great about pancakes.

But tapioca crepes are a strong exception.

I've never heard of Brazilian tapioca crepes before coming to Tap. I tried a sweet crepe with banana and dulce de leche. The texture of the crepe is way better than your usual flimsy crepe. The tapioca starch makes it crisp and firm enough to cut into without demolishing the entire thing. The banana and dulce de leche combo is insanely good. I have a sweet tooth so it's fine for me, but it is very sweet so consider yourself warned.

[Pro-tip] A friendly Brazilian watched me eat this with a fork and knife, and then advised me that it is easier and tastier to eat it *like a sandwich*. He was absolutely right. It's messier, but it's fun and you'll get all the fillings in a condensed bite.

[Random bonuses] It's quite a good treat for people with dietary restrictions. The crepe is only tapioca starch (which has no gluten), salt, and water. No added oil, eggs, stabilizing agents, or anything.

[Other things] Good coffee, super comfy seating arrangements, free WiFi, lots of natural light, and plenty of outlets. There's a sink to wash your hands in the back, but no public bathroom unfortunately.

I introduced myself to tapioca crepes with a sweet version, but apparently the savory ones are very popular as well. Next time I'll give one of those a try. I'd recommend giving this place a shot, even if you're like me and don't like regular crepes."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-06-18,2,"Goodness, what a disaster. I could tell the staff weren't feeling confident but was still surprised when they lost my order. (This is a small cafe -- I was standing by the counter!)

When my crepe arrived, more than twenty minutes later, I literally couldn't eat it. Like tasteless gum.

The coffee was good, thankfully."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-06-11,5,"This is by far one of my favorite coffee spots on the upper west side. The staff are all very knowledgable and welcoming. Once you begin to come here often it feels very ""homely"" and comfortable. Instead of ""you again??""( in an annoyed way) It's, ""YOU"" (with a happier approach). 

I've tried a few of their tapioca crepes and my favorite is the Vegan, even though I am not vegan. The eggs Benedict crepe is also really delicious during breakfast. I really want to try the sweeter crepes but haven't gotten around to it yet.

They also have combo deals for breakfast which include coffee/tea or orange juice for around $6.50 (??) I think, I can't remember haha.

The Acai bowls are fresh and filling, it's NYC so they come at a cost. I can never finish mine because its so filling! 

They distribute a loyalty punch card where if you buy 9 drinks, you get your 10th free. Make sure to ask for one. I've filled mine up a few times. 

The wifi is fast, but the only downfall is their bathroom problem (well not so much a problem in the gross way), ask them to explain to you and they'll tell you why. I think it's unfair people give this place a bad review because of that."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-06-08,5,"Didn't realize this place was gluten-free, but I'm so happy it was! The crepes are gluten-free only, made with tapioca starch. If you aren't used to the texture you may not like them, but I loved them. I had the eggs benedict crepe and it was delicious. Also had coffee and the Brazilian cheese bread, everything was great."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-05-26,1,"I can't believe I just paid $3.5 for their ""homemade lemonade"", it is just lemon water with two mint leaves inside! What a rip off. It's crazy sour too, it's almost too painful to drink. I asked the staff if it's supposed to be this sour, he looked very confused and said yes. So now I'm confused. I seriously just Google lemonade recipes and every single one of them requests sugar! Excuse me, let me try that again. EVERY LEMONADE recipe requires sugar! In fact, it's the second ingredient on the recipe! Right after water! Their lemonade has 0 sugar in it! I'm so pissed! Its so sour to a point that is unbearable! Anyway, I won't be coming back ever. Their tapioca crepes were just okay. Nothing to write home about."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-05-22,5,"I was looking for good lunch places in the area and I saw this suggested and decided to take a look. It was only a 5 minute walk from work so why not. Initially I thought this was a breakfast place with the crepe specials being advertised but my god how it all changed when I looked at the menu. I decided to get the $10.90 Lunch 1 (11am-3pm) Tapioca crepe filled with chicken, mozzarella, tomato, a side of salad and Mango peach iced tea. Total came out to $12.96 with tax which is not too bad for what I got. The crepe was amazing and my made my mouth water with each bite. I was mind blown about how they made tapioca into a crepe form... which is also gluten free... and delicious. Definitely coming back to this place again and I highly recommend it to anyone near Lincoln Center especially to those tourists wanting a bite to eat after seeing a Kelly and Ryan taping."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-05-11,2,"This pains me - a lot.

I've been a TAP regular since day 1 (literally, day 1). I was super excited to come back after some time away for work, to see the staff (who remembered me!) and enjoy the great food. Between my last few visits and my first visit back, I noticed a few things that have caused me to lower my review:

1) The café prides itself on its gluten-free crepes and pastries - and they really are delicious. Several months back, they started carrying oatmeal, which was printed onto the same menu as the crepes, proudly promoting how gluten-free-friendly the establishment was. My fault for not asking, I really should have as someone who is sensitive to gluten, but... it turns out the oatmeal is not gluten free! In fact, they were using store-bought good old Quaker Oats. Thankfully, I didn't get too ill, but let's break this down a little bit. First, you're a place that prides itself on gluten-free products. There are plenty of gluten-free oatmeal products on the market. One would (wrongfully) assume the owner would make that connection and offer a gluten-free oatmeal. He didn't. Second, if you're not going to offer a gluten-free oatmeal in your otherwise gluten-free store, you'd think they would call that out on the menu. They didn't. Third, for people with more serious allergies who found the store to be a safe-haven (I met many), you just introduced a huge amount of cross-contamination potential into what was otherwise a safe space. 

2) The bathroom is no longer for customer use. A staff member explained that following a lawsuit (apparently tied to some sort of ADA issue), the owner had a choice: he could reduce the seat count of the café to skirt the requirement to have a bathroom, or close the shop for a few days to do the construction work required to make the bathroom compliant with whatever ADA issue was identified. He opted to reduce the seat count and close off the bathroom for staff only. This is a café that serves drinks and food, cooked to order. The walls are flanked with power outlets. It was designed for people to come, sit, and spend some time in. They are laptop friendly, to entice people in the slower parts of the day to come, have some food and a coffee, and get some work done. How do you not have a bathroom? Aside from the obvious customer-facing issue here, I'd think that from a profit standpoint, it'd be a more long-term-focused solution to take the cost hit up front, make the repairs to the bathroom, and allow for more seating rather than restrict who can be in your café, which can have a long term impact on profitability. I don't know the business' numbers, but I just don't understand the position. And, for as long as you choose to not allow customers to use the restroom, why not at least put a sign on the door? 

The food and the staff are both still great, but it seems to me like the owner is out of touch with what his customers want and expect. It's a shame, too, because it's a great space. But if it can't be trusted to know its customer base, keep them safe, and offer them the most basic of amenities, then there really is no point in continuing to go.

It's a real shame and I hope the owner addresses these problems.  Until then, tchau Tap."
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-05-02,5,"Tap NYC has the best Açaí bowl that I've ever had!!!! The balance of the açaí and banana is perfect. It does not have an overwhelming banana taste. The fruits on top are super fresh and complement the bowl very well. I think the best part of the bowl is the homemade granola. It is literally the best granola I've ever had in my life!!!! There are lots of nuts and dried fruits. It's super crunchy (but not too crunchy that it cuts your mouth) and extremely well seasoned. I wish I could buy this granola on its own and eat it for the rest of my life. I highly recommend their açaí bowl anytime of the day during any season! I can't wait to try the tapioca wraps that they serve. The next time I go, I will make sure to order it. It seems super interesting."

243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-04-10,5,"Yes! What a great cafe. I had the matcha latte and my friend had the pineapple mint lemonade, which was amazing. Tapioca crepes looked very good, but we skipped them because we weren't that hungry. People were studying in the cafe, but there was still some space to sit. Great to catch up with a friend, study, or grab lunch. Would go back!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-04-07,3,"The place is very cute and cozy... but as a Brazilian I ate better tapiocas in my life... their texture is kind of heavy!  Tapiocas should be thinner, they may put a brazilian guy to make it, I guess... the fillings are good, but not the texture! 
Also the sweeties they have in there (brigadeiros and others) are very overpriced! 
I hope they can improve!"
243,tap-nyc-new-york,2018-04-07,4,"I came to try out their infamous tapioca crepe. I got the ""dark side"" which was the tapioca crepe with banana slices and dark chocolate (you can also choose nutella instead). I am surprised how good it tasted.

I walked into this place with my parents as it looked really good - it was 35 minutes before closing. Proceeded to ask for an espresso and two lattes, and a carrot cake. The waitress looked at me confused saying ""I can't give you any coffee because we close in 30 minutes"". Hm. What? I abstained from commenting and proceeded to ask ""what can I have instead? Any coffee that's ready?"". She laughed at my face and replied ""...tea? But we're closed"". What? Now I had to say something ""you close in 30 minutes, which you said so yourself. You are a coffee place that is not serving coffee. This is also no way to treat new customers."". I will never again come back. Stay away."

There was something almost toasted and nutty to the aftertaste.  Also the lotus flower made in the froth was pretty darn artistic.  I was only in town for a few hours but this is going to me my new go-to anytime I'm in NYC.  Hope to get back while they still have their fall pumpkin offerings still available.

I went around 11 am on a Thursday and it was pretty busy, no line but almost every table was full. My sister and I were lucky to snag the last 2-person one available. This isn't really a location I suggest for working; the tables are small, the environment is pretty loud, and it's cramped quarters overall. There's also no restroom. 

That being said, the coffee is solid and I love that they have a variety of nondairy milks available. I'm always impressed when coffee shops have oat/almond/etc. milk out on the bar next to the half and half and skim."

Staff are all attentive and friendly, no one takes themselves too seriously, and their offerings are consistently excellent (including their single-origin beans and hot coffees). The only remotely annoying thing about the place are the throngs of yuppies lining up to order, but, given the great coffee and the location, this is completely understandable! Keep doing what you're doing!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2019-04-06,3,"Ordered the iced green tea. Which was solid

This space is cozy and the tables are small but comfortable. They have an exterior door outside their primary door, so in the winter there usually isn't that chill breeze that sweeps in whenever someone comes in. 

It's fairly small with only 8 tables crowded in, which is pretty good for a non starbucks cafe in Manhattan. 

I sat here for about an hour and a half while waiting for someone's afterschool ballet class to end. I'd say I was pretty lucky to get a table, and I saw some other ballet students waiting here as well (the studio is just around the corner)

I would come again for the place to sit, but would leave for another cafe if they didn't have a seat."

Sometimes I feel like lattes are too milky at various coffee shops, but their lattes here have a really strong coffee flavor, which I love! If you are a coffee addict like me, definitely give this location a try!

The only negative for me is that there is not a lot of seating and there is no restroom. However, they do have free Wi-Fi, so it is a good place to get work done if there is an open seat/table. I will definitely be back here in the future!"

My friend made the mistake of googling ""Starbucks"" and it pulled up a SBUX on the other side of the building where we were attending the taping. Problem is, it's a SBUX inside the building specifically for ABC employees, so not open to the public. Oops. Security suggested Joe Coffee and it was conveniently a few blocks away. The inside was bright, cozy and warm with a few tables for people to sit and enjoy their coffee. I ordered a hot chocolate and my coffee snob friend ordered a tall dark roast, to which she gave it a thumbs up!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2019-03-16,2,"Yesterday morning I stopped in for the first time. Colleagues of mine raved about this place, so I figured that I'd give it a shot. Cute place, no waiting, but crowded and I couldn't find a seat. I ordered a cappuccino and proceeded to wait on the side. When I saw the barista making one to stay, I asked if I could get it to go instead. He very rudely raised his voice and annoyingly stated ""This isn't yours"" and walked away. I was taken aback. When I did receive my cappuccino, I had two sips and then threw it out. It was terrible for it tasted bitter and burnt. I wouldn't waste my time or money to go here again. It's too bad because I really wanted to like this place."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-12-26,1,"Both the cashier and the barista were surly and rude. They definitely did not make me feel like a welcome customer. And on top of it, my café au lait was burning hot, she way over-steamed the milk to the point of scalding. My son's chai latte was also unbearably hot and burning. Buyer beware!
Hospitality is clearly not important to this shop. With plenty of other coffee options in the neighborhood, I will not return."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-12-20,3,"Visited very briefly on Saturday, Dec. 15, 2018. I only stopped in to check out bags of whole beans. The place was pretty crowded; there'd have been no place to sit if I'd wanted to do so. 

I did end up leaving with a bag of Ethiopian Konga Cooperative Yirgacheffe beans, which are outstanding. Pricey at $20 but you gotta live sometimes. They were at least very fresh, roasted earlier the same week. They make a dang good V60 pourover, that much I can tell you. Might be the most tremendous pourover the world has ever seen before."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-12-18,4,"Small place, great coffee, great prices and super close to Central Park. Went to Joe's after a long walk in the park and was glad to have this cute, little spot at such proximity. My friend took a Latte and I got Hot chocolate and both were great. Service was great, the cashiers were friendly.

Highly recommend this!!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-12-18,2,"Three strikes You're out!
Rude service
Twice  the price as other local spots
Muddy thick acidic coffee"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-11-21,1,The $7 latte is apparently a thing... and not a particularly good latte either! The place is also tiny and the staff are reluctantly helpful. Never again!
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-10-31,5,"Joe's coffee...you are magic in a cup!! Please come to the West Coast!! I'm from the Seattle area, and you would kick nasty Starbuck's a**!! 

I just happened to stumble upon this coffee shop while on a layover.  I ordered a vanilla latte with oat milk and it was good, no, it was great!! Normally I would add a bit of sweetener, but after my first sip I knew it was perfect the way it was. The coffee was smooth and rich, with a hint of sweetness. My only regret is I didn't get a large and wishing I knew about this place earlier.

Another plus was they had a tasty vegan muffin to accompany by tasty beverage. 

Until next time Joe...never change, I promise to be back soon!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-10-02,1,"I work at an office a block away from Joe Coffee and my coworkers and I were looking for a place to get coffee since Starbucks closed and the nearest Starbucks is on 72nd street, so we gave Joe a try. Since none of us drink coffee we stuck to the chai latte and we fell in love. Well, that day we went was the last time we were able to get chai. It's been 2 weeks and they have no chai at the location. You'd think that since they only have a few options other than coffee, they'd keep those in stock but nope. Now we have to take the long walk to Starbucks. It's unfortunate because we have lots of meetings and love our chai and with about 40 staff members.... that's a lot of chai. Too bad."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-09-15,5,"Iced Oat Milk Latte. Delicious! The kids liked their hot chocolate, too. Staff is friendly and helpful. Good people watching."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-08-02,1,The man working the front was extremely rude and condescending. I've never been treated so horribly before. Definitely do not come here. I sat for one second and he literally yelled over the counter asking if I was going to buy anything and if not that I had to leave. I had *JUST* sat down and there were plenty seats available. Can't help think this was racial profiling because he was mugging me the moment I walked in.
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-07-29,3,"The coffee is good and the sitting area(outside) is awesome. The bakery items are not great, I would recommend coffee only.9"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-07-10,5,"Love Joe Coffee everywhere in NY, and this Lincoln Center location was no different. It's a hip and pleasant atmosphere, with decently priced drinks. They make their iced chais really well!

Come here if you want to study, meet friends, or just grab a drink on the way to some other destination. The friendly service is always a plus, and makes the whole experience worth it!

PS. Make sure you get a punch card - you get a free drink after 10 purchases!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-06-23,5,"Wonderful staff, and great coffee. I come here daily and have nothing but the very best of thoughts. Thanks to all the staff who make this place what it is."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-06-15,5,Stopped by and ordered a few lattes on the way to Central Park. This was our favorite coffee place while visiting NY!
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-06-13,4,"They do a great latte! Coming from Melbourne, Australia (we are known for our coffee snobbery) we were very happy to find somewhere to get a good cup. Only negative is it's expensive."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-05-20,3,"Way over priced for what you get. I got an almond milk latte and it was only filled up 75% and the milk didn't taste very fresh. I probably won't come back to this location, although the people who work here are literally the sweetest and friendliest folks!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-05-09,1,"I walk in at 630am on May 9, the rudest employee tells me they're closed. I ask when they open she says, ""Could you step out please?"" I obliged but not before asking why she'd unlock the door to a closed shop. There's a reason I get my coffee every day at the Starbucks on 86 and Columbus. Who wants to walk down 3 blocks for that rudeness?"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-04-21,5,"Unreasonably good drip coffee. So good I ended up drinking more than I intended. Good balance somewhere between Starbucks and hipster coffee. I hope Joe expands nationwide. And the staff is nice too, and they had some gf baked goods options."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-04-16,3,"Their coffee is great! Barista's make every coffee great. It's a good coffee shop to come in, grab your coffee and leave because it's tiny and it's always packed with people. There is always a line when ordering. I gave it 3 stars for 2 good reasons:
1. No bathroom
2. No wifi

I like working on my computer at coffee shops. Despite me having wireless wifi with Spectrum (which they are terrible!), I still prefer using the coffee shops wifi because it's not so spotty. WiFi is super important to me. Even if I don't bring in my computer, I like to be on my phone and do work from it. 

So, it's  coffee shop to grab coffee on the go. Def not for strollers either! Too small."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-04-03,5,"They have best hot Chocolate
I am happy that they take credit card 
And very are very friendly"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-03-29,5,"Easy going crew, everyone is so nice and shockingly awake.. got an oatmilk latte - perfectly yummy!!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-02-17,2,"When you walk by don't be fooled by the a pint of people in line. This is New York every coffee shop is busy in the morning. Coffee is just average. And I asked for a larger latte.  I was told that they only have one size and I needed to by 2 lattes if I wanted a larger size. They might get want to look at their pricing board.  The latte is in the far right row with the large or extra large regular coffee size. Confused, I was.  If you see Joes coffee just walk by there has to be a better coffee  on the next block, with better customer service."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2018-02-01,3,"Just okay. 

Staff is friendly and prices are average. Bf had a macchiato and I had a drip coffee. Neither one of us really enjoyed our drinks. They had an unfortunate burnt flavor to them."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-12-12,4,"Cute little oasis for some quick Java fix. No frills, just a place to get that much needed caffeine."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-11-27,4,"Really great cold brew here, strong and great depth of flavor. There's a small seating area, it's definitely more manageable in the summer time as they have outdoor seating but it's also a popular place to hang out on Columbus Ave. It's not necessarily the cleanest location of this NYC coffee chain and it feels like one of their busier ones (based on the size). I usually just grab and go here."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-11-18,5,"Good coffee for a less than Starbucks price.  Nuff said.  

Also, the inside looks pleasant to sit in."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-11-02,4,"Had a cappuccino which was pretty good by NY  standards. After living in Europe and drinking Italian espresso and Turkish coffee, US coffee no matter how good is just OK...

I liked that Joe actually serves in China and not just paper....paper is awful! 

A little out of the way but so much better than Starbucks puke!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-10-03,4,"Excellent coffee and expresso drinks, great selection of pastries and donuts, friendly baristas. They also have a punch card (1 punch/drink; 10 punches = 1 free drink, can be any drink). Downside is that there isn't much space to sit, or even stand inline. We love Joes, but have learned that if there is a marathon/5K in Central Park this place is completely over-run at least into the early afternoon."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-09-30,4,"One of the best almond milk lattes I have had! In hanging out at Central Park the suegra and I wanted some iced coffee. The hubs while getting pizza landed on this gem. Thank goodness!!! The right amount of ice, almond milk and some smooth espresso!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-07-27,3,"Came here because yelp said they have wifi, BUT THEY DONT. Also, the hot chocolate is very average. The hot chocolate at Dunkin donuts is better."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-06-13,1,Worst espresso. If you like authentic Italian espresso... skip this place. $3.30 is way too much and it's terrible.
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-05-29,5,"I visited Joe Coffee because they open at 7am on the weekend where everywhere else opens at 8 except Starbucks (and I refuse to spend my money in there)
A very nice cup of 8oz latte with 2 shots.  The espresso is on the stronger side which I love and it is nice that the espresso flavor pierced through the Califia almond milk and foam (califia is very velvety in texture and it tends to flatten the the kick and the finishing note some coffee beans have). 
The barista was very friendly- and I got my perfect cup
On a Sunday morning to start off the day!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-05-16,4,"I really like the coffee here. It's way better than Starbucks and the staff is just lovely.  This particular location is, however, too small.  In the morning the line goes out the door wth only 5 or 6 people in cue. It's great on a warm day however, as you can sit outside.  I would most likely not use this as a meet-up spot.  it's just a really great place to get coffee to go. Today I had an iced latte with skim milk and it was fabulous. I couldn't finish it but it woke me up and filled me up so that I was able to nail it at the gym right after!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-04-16,2,"I am not an expert on coffee, and can only review this joint based on my experience drinking coffee across America. The coffee is lightly roasted and the espresso is undercooked. The sourness of their coffee can be tasted even when litigiously hot--a bad sign.

The coffee is mediocre at best, but the staff I experienced there on this one particular morning was fun.

There was a blue-haired barrister, overweight--clothing non-designer. She had a septum piercing and some tattoos. Her conversation with her co-workers were about the maleness of the indie rock scene, and how POC (people of color) are underrepresented in the scene. As a black man from Michigan, this made me feel uncomfortable. Let me shelve my race card and instead play the snowflake badge. I need a safe space. This hurt my feelings. It's no wonder my espresso came out sour... a bitter, sour-grapes chewing, Vagina Monologue reciting third-wave feminist milked it from the machine. An espresso machine designed and created by the patriarchy, based on the principles of science, which we all know is a sham propagated by male hegemony.

G'day!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-04-13,4,"The doughnuts are amazing, the coffee is great, and every employee seems very into their job. Definitely will be coming back as much as I can. It's a little pricey -- $7.75 for a large coffee and a doughnut -- and I'm not a big fan of the Square thing they use to take credit card payments, but it's definitely worth it"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-04-05,4,"It's a chain coffee shop but the small interior with about 10 seats inside works to proVide a cozy vibe. NO WIFI I repeat there is no wifi here. There's is one person who wrongly assumed that there is wifi but I assure you there is no free wifi here. The TWC type of wifi is here but if you are not a local and don't have an account then you are out of luck. There is also no bathroom. 

Coffee however, the cortado to be specific, is perfect. Their chai latte is also yums. They also have underwest donuts here."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-03-18,2,"Very good coffee meets high pretension, high price, no wifi and a notably leather croissant."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-02-16,2,"Hi, can I have a latte with a shot of pretentiousness please? $6 for a pint size yogurt parfait that one can finish in 3 bites? This is what's gone wrong w NYC. Good luck Danny Meyer"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-02-05,5,"It might be fighting words to say this is the best coffee in NYC, but I'm willing to go out on a limb for Joe. This is easily the best coffee I've had in NYC. The only espresso that comes close to it is Blue Bottle in San Francisco, and the espresso made from beans my sweetheart roasts at home. Yes, the space is tiny. Yes, the baristas aren't the fastest (though they are among the friendliest and certainly the most competent). But you're looking for great coffee, right? If yes, Joe Coffee is for you."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-01-17,5,"This UWS small storefront coffee shop offers a nice street view. There are a handful of tables but not enough to outpace the demand. On the weekends, the line can lead right out the door so don't plan on meeting friends and expect to get a table."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2017-01-11,4,"Good spot for a rest and cup of... Joe. 

We walked around Central Park and needed a place to get warm. Perfect, this spot served coffee and had seating. I got a latte, and fiancé got a hot chocolate. The espresso is great here, and the foaming technique is good (come on, you must have at least one experience where the barista did not know how to foam milk for your drink). I really appreciated my latte. (I totally sound like a coffee nerd lol)

Joe also offers punch out cards. After ten purchases, you get a free 12oz. drink."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-11-18,5,"I enjoy their coffee a lot, so much that their lack of interior study space is forgivable. I wish they had a bit more room to spare to give customers more space to read and talk, but again, their coffee makes up for it."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-11-09,4,"staff was very friendly and helpful. coffee was worth the price. the place itself was very small, however that is irrelevant if you are on the go!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-11-06,5,"Summary:  Great coffee in a barren wasteland of no coffee shops. Small seating area is good for 1 or 2, though I've seen folks take up to six, particular on the outdoor seating.
 
That's right. Barren wasteland... that is how it feels when you are not caffeinated and need your fix in the early AM in this part of UWS.....Lincoln Square if you're a realtor.  

It's actually almost laughable.  Other than Joe's you've got 2 types of options for coffee:  1) Places that sell coffee but don't open until close to noon 2) places that sound like they should have great coffee, but don't (Europan, MetroCafe, etc).  Otherwise, you got to hoof it down to Columbus Circle for a proper fix.

Joe's properly sells coffee and coffee accoutrements, i.e. bagels, croissant, pain au chocolat, you know... stuff you want with coffee, not a cooler with snapple.  

Do I know it's a bit of a chain?  Yes. Do I care, no.  I love the staff here.  They will still make that cute little milk heart in the froth for you no matter how busy it gets post NYC Central Park run.  I Heart your milk-froth-heart.

The pastries are actually pretty good.  I always get the pain au chocolat, which isn't just chocolate bits but solid chocolate chunks."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-11-01,3,Coffee is great but the service could be better. I ordered an iced-coffee and asked for less ice. The barista simply poured out the existing ice and handed me a half-cup of iced coffee. I was a bit surprised to be honest. The service was also a bit slow and there were a ton of flies/mosquitoes flying around which was surprising since it was chilly and it was October already. Will hope that other locations aren't as poor.
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-10-23,2,"Slow service and coffee is just okay. There's always a long wait to get coffee, probably because there is only one espresso machine. I only come when I'm in the area and need coffee. Starbucks with their long lines are faster than here."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-10-22,4,"Most adorable tiny little coffee shop. I love the wooden tables outside.

Barista service is a *little* slow, but still acceptable.

Chai is so delicious and fresh-tasting here. Highly recommend."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-09-30,5,"We were on vacation and we just wanted anything but Starbucks for a change! A local recommended this little gem to us and we absolutely loved it. Friendly staff, small but clean place and the coffee is amazing. If your in the area try it~~"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-09-29,5,"Stopped by for a cup of Joe (haha) got a cortado and loved it. Great atmosphere, amazing coffee. Their espresso blend is sweet and smooth. I actually will likely buy some online."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-09-25,5,"The best.   Come here every time in Ny.  Tall guy
Barista (don't know his name) who made my cappuccino this morning crushed it, as he always does.  The microform is so fine it's like silk.  It's what cappuccino is supposed to be like but never is -- except here.  Also much better vibe than coffee shops in tourist areas -- here it's mostly locals, lots of regulars.  Highly recommended."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-09-21,4,"Great coffee, but it's cash only and there is seldom any seating. It's not far from Central Park, which means you can take it to go enjoy elsewhere."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-09-01,1,"Came here with my mom. Ordered two soy lattes ($12 for some reason). Watched them make it and was pretty sure they used regular milk, but figured they knew what they were doing and didn't want to be a bother. The guy gave me my two lattes and told me they were soy. I am lactose intolerant, so soy milk is essential for me (and cost an extra 50¢ per latte). I immediately thought that it didn't taste right, but didn't want to argue after he told me that they were soy. About an hour later, I was sick. Experiencing everything I normally do after consuming lactose. Now I can't be sure, of course, but all signs seem to suggest that my latte was not soy. This alone is not good, but when you consider that I paid an extra $1 for soy (though I was really just paying to get sick), it's especially unfair and wrong."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-08-17,4,"Cute little coffee place, yummy chocolate banana muffin. Seating for about 15 inside and has wifi. If you need some Joe or a quick pastry in the area, definitely a solid option to keep in mind!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-08-05,4,"Good little local coffee chain spot in upper west side. It is especially nice in the warmer months when they have outdoor seating. Otherwise it is a really tiny shop, and always crowded, so not always a great place for meeting people! I like their iced chai lattes. And they have a few (limited) gluten free food options. Service is ok, but usually they are trying to move customers through since there is usually a line. Overall it is a solid spot near Lincoln Center to grab coffee that is not Starbucks or a bodega."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-07-28,5,"This company gets some damn good beans, they brew it well. I have never had a drink from this place that I have not liked. Pricey, yes, but clearly worth it compared to the burnt crap you pay for from Starbucks, the ""flavored"" stuff that you may find in various places. I'll stop picking on large chain companies and say that the Mocha that Joe makes is very nice, and not too sweet. They have really tasty treats too, donuts, banana bread, cookies, etc. If you are in Manhattan, BK, you have to try this place! My favorite coffee I have had here is an Ethiopian bean"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-07-27,5,Just the best. I make it part of my daily walk and it's a great reward to get my cortado. The best baristas.
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-07-13,1,Too bad. Good coffee and good place to sit and work or meet up with someone. But no wifi and no bathroom. How either is even a thing in NYC- or anywhere- is beyond me.
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-07-03,3,"I had a cappuccino and a muffin, so not much. The service is slow, i wonder how they do with more people ordering. There is outside seating, and the place is clean, the service friendly..."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-07-03,5,"Stopped here for a caffe latte on my way to Central Park. The barista was super friendly, and there is great outdoor seating. Definitely will stop here again!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-06-10,5,I ordered a cafe late and it was pretty good!!!! The cream was decorated nicely and cozy atmosphere!!! The best place to take a rest and drop by alone!!!!
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-06-05,5,"Went it for Flat White and mentioned how I like less milk with my espresso, so the employee suggested ""Cortado"" and I must say it was exactly what I wanted!! Delish!! Also ordered Iced Chai Latte which was was amazing as well!

Great coffee and great service :)

Thanks!!!!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-05-26,5,"Awesome coffee place. While the line can sometimes be long, that's just because the coffee is so good!  The staff is really friendly and all the coffees they make are incredible. I especially like their single origin coffee, it's always fantastic. There is also a nice little patio to sit outside on a nice day to enjoy the coffee and take in the laid back upper west side vibe. Overall my go-to coffee joint!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-05-22,2,Great coffee. Terrible service. Came here the last two days and ordered an almond milk cappuccino. Yesterday they gave me a cortado and today they gave me a latte. The cashier also called the group behind me annoying while taking my order. Get it straight and be kind!
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-05-06,4,Very modern coffee joint with a wooden set up. It's a decent size and seats about 2 dozen heads. WiFi is available for those Web surfers.
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-04-27,5,"I come here literally every day to visit, grab and go, and even sit and do work. This is my local neighborhood coffee shop I always wanted when I moved to the city. Also, the best baristas! Kind, personable and really know their craft. You will not be disappointed!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-03-29,4,"There's a Tumblr term that applies to tiny, cute things: smol. Joe Coffee is smol as smol can be. 

The coffee is too good and the Doughnut Plant Doughnuts too delicious for this square footage and the single outlet. There's excellent people watching too because of its proximity to the Lincoln Center area. So you start to feel a little dejected waiting for a seat on busy days. :(

But look on the bright side! It's getting warmer and soon you'll be able to take your Joe to-go and sit out in the sunshine feeling all the smol nestle inside you with each sip.

244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-02-20,5,"Sugar free vanilla latte extra hot. I get this every time, and its just perfect."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-01-17,5,"Came to this location this morning since I was on the Upper West Side and thought I would see if I liked the vibe here.  It's quite cute, though the line basically went almost out of the door, but other than that I like the place and the customer service I received.  Very polite and friendly.  I had a free drink card from the Joe Coffee location at Grand Central that I received after some guy basically cut the line and took my drink and another customer's drink, forcing me to have to wait for yet another one to be made, which was quite the wait, as the baristas seem to believe in taking great care to ensure that the drinks they make come out great.  The waits can be a bit long, but the quality makes up for it.  I have actually stopped frequenting one of my organic coffee spots (at least for coffee anyway for now) as I've been very happy with Joe Coffee and the pastries that they sell... Addictive!!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-01-14,5,"This is my favorite coffee near work. The staff are pretty switched on, and know how to keep the line moving when it's busy. They have a frequent coffee punch card, which is a nice incentive to return. Also, if you buy coffee beans, they have a punch card for that too. The coffee selection is great, but my favorite without a doubt is the almond milk latte. I haven't had a bad one yet! If you're feeling a bit hungry with your drink, grab a donut as well - the maple syrup one is fantastic!"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2016-01-10,5,"Excellent Cortardo. Possibly the best coffee we have had so far in the USA. Meets South African standards, friendly staff and decent pricing. Really enjoyable vine"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-12-25,1,Didn't like it. Coffee was very sour. I don't understand why this is such a highly rated place. The staff should've offered to make me a new cup or something else when I said I'd like them to take my back or throw it out. Very strange. I don't recommend and I won't be coming back.
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-12-10,3,"I just don't think the coffee taste that good. I go with the house drip, traditional iced coffee, and cold brew. I go at least once a week because it beats going to Starbucks down the block but I just dont think the coffee taste good.

Service is good for the most part. A few times its been really slow and other times you feel rushed. The set up isn't all that great to wait in line, for your coffee and to get milk but it works."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-11-24,5,"Great coffee. I love their house blends. Much stronger than my office coffee - perfect in the mornings.
Quick efficient ladies behind the counter."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-11-12,5,"I spend half my money energy and time in coffee shops and looking for the perfect cup . Being a coffee snob ain't easy and well while I say that it's easy too ... Too many places to choose from and they are just as good with some being Exceptional. 
Joe for me is a chain but a local one. Before they decide to go the Shake Shack and Magnolia way ! 
And though I may not be a fan of the ones who expand I understand some of them just have to :) 
This Joe Iam particularly fond of one its in my hood and closest to get hands on coffee just as when I open my eyes but also this Joe has the best best best Baristas .... They - fewer they may be ( as I see the same ppl everyday) are like real Artists and friendly too ! 
Also my one place for the best Cortados in town if u don't want a Stumptown or an  Abraco !"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-11-08,3,Coffee is good but it takes forever. Are you still waiting? Probably because it takes so long. Hellooooooo.
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-10-20,5,"The workers are kind and responsive and the quality of their products is fantastic, I really enjoyed my cider and my out of town friends, who had said that all of the coffee they'd has was atrocious were impressed."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-10-10,5,Love their Coffee und relaxed ambience:). Once you try it you are not going to settle for Starbucks anymore
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-08-27,5,Perfect for my first morning stop. Coming to Joes is exactly what I need to get me going in the morning. I wish every coffee shop tried half as hard as they guys do here
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-08-25,5,I stopped by to get an iced coffee and came across their selection of croissants. Both were delicious. Got to stop by here again.
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-08-16,5,"I'm really picky when it comes to my espresso drinks, I like them strong! Starbucks doesn't do it for me, but this place is AWESOME!! Strong espresso"
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-06-24,5,My favorite coffee in the city so far. Such great flavor - wonderfully bold!
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-06-21,5,"Another stop on my cold brew your of NYC. The store was hot with no AC on this hot summers day. Service was friendly and the cold brew available in 2 sizes, $3.25 for small and $4 for large. Fantastic cold brew and the large best value in NYC a city where good cold brew doesn't come cheap."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-05-25,1,"Had never been to this location before. I love Joe, they are consistently the best coffee shop(s) in the city, mainly because of the consistently kind, rad people who work there. Everyone is very chill and interesting--good vibes. Except here. This was awful. The 2 employees didn't greet me, just stared as the gal kept bitching about another employee, then singing loudly and being patronizing about how to use the Square checkout, when I was just trying to get my punch card out of my wallet. Blue is a great album...just save the attitude. Won't be back to this one."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-05-23,5,A perfectly executed cappuccino & a jelly doughnut.  I'm very happy. The service here is friendly & relaxed. I really enjoyed my window seat where I was able to charge my phone & watch the world pass by.
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-05-17,4,"Busy little cafe with friendly staff and high quality brew. When the sun is out, grab your takeaway coffee and head to Central Park nearby."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-05-04,4,"Decent coffee, on par with some of the best coffee shops in the city like Birch, Stumptown, Third Rail & 9th Street. Apparently they are on a mission to make the BEST FLAT WHITE in NYC. So do strike a conversation to learn more about their progress. 

- Very friendly staff.
- Only proper coffee shop near Lincoln Square."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-04-26,1,"Joe Coffee serves up Artisan coffee with care most of the time. The coffee is freshly roasted and brewed. My problem with this location is the unsanitary way today's barista performed. He turned away with hos back to the La Marzocco, blew and wiped his nose into a tissue, I hope and proceeded to immediately brew espresso touching the portafilter, tamper and swiping across the coffee in the portafilter with his gremy, unwashed hands."
244,joe-coffee-company-new-york-9,2015-04-25,4,"My wife has been getting on me about rating too low for places that are decent. I got the house blend. It was drinkable. Joe Coffee, you are the benefactor of my wife's criticism. 4 stars."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2020-04-09,4,"Boule & Cherie is a favorite coffee shop / lunch spot on the Upper East Side to get some work done, meet with friends, or, in my case, tutor! With a decent amount of seating and steady wifi, it's a great option when looking to get a bit of work done or sit for a bit to work and then meet up with friends. My usual selection has included the matcha latte (which you can get unsweetened), cappuccinos (more than I care to admit), and a variety of muffins, all of which have been delicious. Overall, a very solid cafe work stopping into!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2020-02-29,4,Came here craving a Golden Milk Tumeric Latte after waking up sick. It did not disappoint! Topped it with a little cinnamon and sugar.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2020-02-12,4,"If you're looking for a cafe to get some work done, this is a great option in NYC! Reasons being: multiple tables, bathroom, solid wifi, solid drink menu and plethora of baked goods to choose from. They seriously got it all! It does get busy on a Saturday so I would recommend coming in early to secure a table on the weekends. They have some outlets around, but I would also recommend coming with a charged laptop to be safe. One bonus to this place is that they don't charge you extra for milk alternatives! This cafe will definitely be in my mix of study places to visit."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2020-02-09,4,"With tables, couches, and counter seating, Boule & Cherie is a great place to study, read, and catch up with friends. They have a wide array of pastries, sandwiches, and, of course, coffees and teas. I'm a huge fan of their almond croissant and their chai latte with almond milk. A great plus is that there is no extra charge for non-dairy substitute so get your oat/almond/soy milk on. 

For folks coming here to study, there are a few outlets and outlet strips available. There's wifi as well. In terms of noise, it can get pretty loud but I had ear buds in so it didn't bother me."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2020-01-05,3,"I'm not too sure why Boule & Cherie has a relatively high rating.  I came by on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was packed.  The staff is friendly and prompt, but it's not enough to make up for the so-so pastries that aren't fresh.  My pastry was about the same level of pastry you can get at a Gristedes.  The espresso was average.  What I find slightly strange is the lack of care when you stay to eat--espresso in a paper cup and pastry in a bleached wooden basket.  It doesn't make me want to stay, but rather get a move on as if I were at an airport.  I'm also not too sure how people park here on their laptops given the noise, the squished layout, and cement pillars blocking a fair amount of the only view by the window.  There is something about the place that feels strangely cobbled together and lacking cohesiveness.  Maybe it's the clashing of furniture or lack of art on the wall.  There's also no music.  Something just feels off..."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2020-01-02,5,"Great place to sit down and have a coffee while studying or working. I usually have the mocha and its always so rich. The sandwiches are decent as well. They have a fairly large menu for such a small shop. Can be a bit loud since the crowd changes so quickly, so probably not a good place for phone calls. Overall can't complain, and this provides everything I need when I go."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-11-09,5,"Best turkey croissant I ever had!! Going there every weekend now! Coffee was also good, sandwiches are pretty big!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-10-23,2,"Average food with slow, borderline incompetent service.  The people who work there seem to be bored hipsters. There are better options out there"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-10-04,5,My favorite local coffee shop!!! Literally get my coffee here every day. The staff are great and part of the reason we go!
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-10-03,5,"WiFi  seating  cheaper food 

I came to this cafe early (7:45am) on a Thursday and found the place to be empty and quiet. There was a slow flow of people coming in to order, but no one else really stayed. When 8:30am hit the place was full and loud like a brunch place..

In terms of food, I was between the salmon sandwich (smoked salmon, cream cheese and toppings on French bread), frittata and the veggie tortilla. The employee recommended the frittata ($5 after tax) because it's popular and filling (comes with side salad). It was filling but not that tasty so I wouldn't order it again. They bring the food to your table!! There's also a large assortment of pastries, pre-made salads, and coffee. 

The staff is friendly and the location is clean, def recommend for a quick breakfast or doing work for 1-1.5 hrs.

PLS get reusable silverware tho!!!!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-09-14,5,"My favorite place to grab coffee in the morning, all sandwiches and pastries so fresh. Friendly people, Nice and Clean. Blueberry muffins are most delicious. Outdoor seating, highly recommended!!!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-09-09,1,"I walked past this café one morning recently. It seemed tempting so I walked in. The smell of bacon was so overpowering I walked straight out again.

I have no desire to drink coffee or eat a pastry in such a noxious environment. Clearly other people do, or they don't mind, since the tables seemed quite full."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-08-27,3,"This is an ok place. Had an almond croissant with a cortado. Coffee was warm, not hot, and the croissant not 100% fresh. Employees were nice but unfortunately there was no soap in the toilet. Hoping they can improve these points. For more reviews check my profile"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-06-07,2,"Just went with my friend to grab breakfast and wow. We got the broccoli cheddar and the caramelized onion and goat cheese quiche plus a Nutella danish to go. They were warmed and looked pretty good with a small side salad. My broccoli was pretty average (except for the very clearly frozen and now very soggy piece of broccoli placed on top) but hers. Dear fucking god. It tasted like they wanted the caramelized onions to actually be caramel. There was definitely sugar in there, if not actual caramel syrup. It would've been completely inedible if it weren't for the goat cheese. But whatever, maybe food isn't really their thing and that nutella danish could still save it. Except what we pulled out of the pastry bag was not a nutella danish. It's apparently their almond and cheese danish and it was not particularly flavorful either. Pretty damn disappointing all around as the server even had me check what she entered, and it was correct. Maybe it's harder than I realized to distinguish between pastries."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-05-13,5,"This is my favorite cafe in the area. The sandwiches and pastries are always so fresh. Also, I love that there are plenty of outlets all around the space so it's a perfect place for working on a laptop or charging your phone."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-05-08,5,"Place is quiet, quick with orders and clean. There have a great selection and Mariana is awesom"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-04-28,3,"It's comfortable enough to stay for an hour or so.  And there's plenty of seating. Not to mention an assortment of lunch items and desserts.  But something left me wanting more.  They didn't have any salads.  And the coffee was just so-so - a bit bland.  

On a more positive note, the staff is wonderful here - attentive, smiley and prompt.  

I'm sure I'll be back."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-04-23,5,"Great stop for a coffee, lunch or a mid afternoon snack!  Great staff, food and environment!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-04-21,2,"Nice server. Great coffee. Worst Almond Croissant I ever had. No flaky, buttery goodness to be found. A gob of bread, basically. Hugely disappointed as I thought French bakeries all had flakey pastries? Not this one."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-03-28,1,Nasty dry & stale pastries. Literally their so called croissants trash after two bites and honestly one was already one too many. No resemblance in flavor or texture to actual croissant.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-03-23,4,"Good place to chatting with friends and have some coffee & bread, everything here was okay till I got my coffee after I've been waiting for a while...and found out that they forgot my coffee. I realized that after I saw 3-4 clients got their order before me and I've got no apology from the staff. So minus one star!!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-03-20,4,Good pastries and coffee! Great place to study: there's lots of seating and free wifi.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-03-17,4,"Great space and friendly atmosphere. Coffee was good, I had asked for an extra shot in my coffee and was happy to pay for it, but didn't receive it. It was too busy to go back. Their pastries and food looked delicious, even though I didn't try them. I would happily come back again."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-02-25,5,"Just tried this place for the first time since moving to the neighborhood last week.  First impression: A+ for space and comfort. Plenty of seating and counter space-- not like those cramped cafés that are claustrophopic. 
A+ for super-friendly staff.  Very accommodating and responsive.
A+ for Deeeeelicious coffee!!!  I ordered a decaf latté with oat mylk..  it was served really hot and very yummy!  They must roast their beans over a campfire or something bcuz the taste is so unique. Very rich, even for a Decaf!
A- for egg & cheese croissant sandwich.  It was very good and they toasted the croissant which i love, but the sandwich was a bit dry.  Need a lil olive oil or butter to make it less dry. But, otherwise, tasty and hot and FRESH.
A- for speed of service. If i was on my way to work, i could not have waited 10 min for the sandwich.  They have other ready-made sandwiches that contained meat, so mine had to be specially ordered --that's understandable.
All in all, a wonderful experience.  I will definitely be back!!!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-01-12,2,"I just bought plain croissant at 8am and it felt like from yesterday, I didn't like it at all. They do not bake on the premises."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2019-01-05,2,"Unfortunately I cannot say how the food is at this establishment.  That's because almost nothing has the price of the item marked on it or indicated anywhere.  Whether it is their refrigerator case near the door (the chicken salad looked great but how much does it cost?) or the display case at the register the foods are unpriced.  The big menu board lists prices for beverages but they also sell a large assortment of foods.

Rather than play a guessing game or asking the employees for the price of each item I just left.  I live nearby and would likely eat there but they have to let me know what it is going to cost first."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-12-27,5,Love this place....the food is very good...plenty of seating...power ports for working...good wifi...and cool ambiance. I would take anyone here for just about any casual occasion.  I'm always on the lookout for awesome cafes a d this one fits the bill
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-12-08,4,This place is pretty busy but the line moves quickly. Getting a seat could be tough. Not bad but the latte with oat milk left a slightly bitter aftertaste. First trying oat milk so maybe it's just me.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-12-02,2,Took 15 minutes with 2 people in line to get a hot coffee. Slow service and the baristas don't know what's going on.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-11-06,5,"Everything is good. You can't choose wrong. Go!
I stayed at an Air BnB around the corner and had the privilege of indulging my caffeine and sugar addiction 3 days in a row!
The Dulce de Leche is their sweet coffee. Very nice!
No decaf drip, but you can have an Americano.
Chai Latte is great as well.
The Pumpkin and Cheese Muffin is delicious and filling, but seasonal. Lucky me! Did I mention I am the luckiest man in the world; 'tis true!
All of their pastries look great and I don't doubt their quality.
It's definitely a local favorite as I could see from repeat clientele.
Visit if you can."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-10-26,5,"Great coffee, sandwiches, and service! I usually get the smoked salmon sandwich and cappuccino, highly recommend!  
Great natural lighting. Sometimes it gets crowded and is hard to find a seat- but it is NYC so that's usually a given."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-09-29,4,"I came here a few days ago and I was pleased with the experience..

I got a whole grain croissant, caramelized onion with cheese quiche, and orange juice.

Orange juice was fresh. I can really taste actual orange which was really good. Their croissant was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It had some grains that gave it a nice texture. Though I wish I asked to warm up the croissant if it was possible. The real star was the quiche and it came with a side salad. The salad dressing was a bit sweet which I liked because it went well with the quiche. The quiche was heated and served. The cheese in the quiche had a distinct flavor and the caramelized onions gave the quiche a good flavor too. I personally liked the crust/edges because it had a bite which contrasted the more soft quiche. I would eat the croissant, salad, and quiche in a single bite and it was like eating a sandwich. The food was good on their own, but together they were complimentary.

I would definitely like to go again for their food if I am ever around the area."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-09-16,4,Great neighborhood spot for all your caffeine needs.  Grab a pastry enjoy the sun soaked space inside or outside.  Cute turquoise.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-09-16,4,"So after walking past this place almost everyday since it opened, I decided to spend my money here instead of Starbucks. If you're up early on a Saturday or Sunday morning, and are looking for a nice quiet place to relax and read or study; this is definitely the place for you. I came in around 2 and this place was a full of people but quiet. I ordered a small iced chai latte and a chocolate chip scone. The iced chai latte was sooo good I'd wish I ordered a large, but the scone I had was very hard. I was quite disappointed, but of course if they're freshly baked from the morning they'll harden over time... I honestly didn't even finish it I threw it away. But anywhooo this place is definitely a nice place to sip for a refreshment or just coming in to catch up with an old friend. If you're in the neighborhood, don't pass by this place. I'll definitely be back for a larger iced chai latte"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-09-16,5,"Cute name! Great place for Sunday brunch. They have so many vegetarian quiches, I could come here again and again. Maybe I will! I especially recommend the mushroom quiche, served with a yummy side salad. Espresso coffee is also excellent. Seating indoors and outdoors. Free WiFi, and kids are welcome to play here (animals outside only)."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-09-02,5,I absolutely love this coffee shop and I love that they are one of the few cafes that have coconut milk!  Their coffee is so good and they sell alfajores which is the most delicious snack ever!!!'
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-08-04,1,"Great coffee but the staff are really rude, especially the guy and the woman working on Saturday mornings in recent months. For multiple times, I saw clearly they rolled their eyes while I was ordering. It was also pretty clear they were talking about me in Spanish. I have been going to this place for morning coffee for years and the people that used to work there were really nice and welcoming. But I may stop going because the people working there now are making me really uncomfortable"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-07-27,1,"Had a terrible experience here. Asked for coffee and blueberry muffin to go. They gave me a half filled cup of luke warm coffee and a cranberry muffin. Immediately told the woman it was error- I wanted blueberry. She said we don't have that so you get cranberry. I added cream to my coffee and asked for her to fill the cup properly. She refused. I asked for bag to carry out. She put the cup in a large shopping bag which, when I picked it up, it spilled. The woman would not replace."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-07-19,5,"I am obsessed with B&C's cold brew from Stumptown. I am from the Portland, OR area and love being able to have a little taste from home everyday in New York. The pastries are seriously some of the best I've had in the states. I can say this is my favorite coffee shop thus far in nyc :)"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-07-17,4,"Chic café with a solid roast and great selection of pastries. Prices are typical for Manhattan. Staff is always attentive. 

I'm a fan of their cold brew and iced americanos.

Also, really like the play on words (Boule & Cherie = Boulangerie)"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-07-17,4,I like this cafe. Nice for occasional studying or working. Can get crowded during weekend brunch hours. Drinks and baked goods are okay.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-07-03,4,"Cute cafe with a nice, clean interior (lots of wood and bright, natural lighting). 

Loads of pastries, quiches, and sandwiches -- I didn't have a chance to anything other than the almond croissant and cold brew. I wish there were lighter options for breakfast (that would make this place a 5/5). The almond croissant was a bit dry, but the cold brew was great!  

Not too many outlets, but a lot of small tables and counter seating as well. There's also a big couch with a coffee table that is near an outlet.

There's one bathroom here, and it's well-kept and very clean. Free unlimited wifi and air conditioning (I came here to work during the summer heatwave), and also friendly staff."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-06-22,3,"Cute spot! Bring your laptop and smash out your terrible screenplay while enjoying the bright atmosphere. There's a big leather couch at the back if you're feeling truly decadent (or if you just want to have a lot of trouble eating food from a plate on your knee.) Lots of outlets, free wifi, bathroom available for patrons. 

Coffee was god-awful, though, and my quiche was dry and tasteless. (But then, aren't most quiches? Who orders those anyway?!)"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-06-04,5,"coffee is great, threats are great, ambient is great.  Only issue is that they close early for what i would like..  i'd wish they were open 24/7...."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-06-03,4,"Lively and full of sweets! I had a brunch with my girlfriend here and it was great. Their fresh squeezed oj was on point and their smoked saon sandwich was so bad. 
Their pastry looks yummy and it looks like they bake their own! The place is full of surprises as you will find free samples hidden throughout the place. 
One more thing: it is bright there. Their windows face the streets and the place pretty much do not need to have their lights on. 
I'll definitely go back for brunch in the future."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-05-26,5,"I love the freshly prepared food here. Care for a flaky, buttery croissant? Or a quiche with salad? This is the place. And the staff are friendly and helpful."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-05-11,3,"Great coffee. Quality quiche but unfortunate they reheat it in microwave, which turns the crust to mush. How about posting a list of quiche types available? Server was unhappy to recite the flavors available."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-05-04,5,"This is becoming a usual spot for me to visit in between teaching classes nearby. Delicious coffee, quiches, and muffins, they're always super nice, and they play great music. It's not exorbitantly priced and quick even when they're busy. 

Get an iced americano and an almond croissant!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-04-05,4,"Excellent atmosphere. Clean bathrooms. Courteous staff. The front door is extremely heavy and difficult to open. Pastries are bush league so they lose 1 star for that, otherwise this place is great. Haven't tried the quiches/sandwhiches but I wouldn't trust those either. Cappucinos/Latte are good, as are some of the fancier options like mochas or matcha lattes"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-03-18,4,"A small place near Lincoln center. I ordered my usual latte and although I said several times it was to drink there, the barista made it in a paper copy. When I corrected him, he just dumped it in a ceramic cup. Anyway, it was pretty good but the milk was textured more for a capp.  The muffins were good and it has an interesting atmosphere."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2018-01-14,5,Love this place: best blueberry muffin and white mocha in town; great selection of drinks; fast WiFi; cheerful and lovely ambiance
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-12-13,4,"Coffee drinks and tea and pastries (oh my!). It can be a bit difficult to get a table, but that's probably because there are abundant outlets and free wifi.... so people turn this place into an office of sorts. I had a tasty latte and an amazingly delicious chocolate chip cookie.... and was quite happy with my mid-afternoon snack."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-11-19,4,"Been here twice and have received nothing short of stellar service. Good coffee, good pastries, fast WiFi and a nice restroom.

My only qualm with this place is that it occasionally gets very noisy with small kids, I think from parents coming out of the preschool nearby. 

The decor is surprisingly cozy, with a leather couch tucked into the corner. But there are also plenty of tables and outlets if you're looking for something more productive.

And shout-out to the barista here today who, after noticing the croissant he was about to give us was smaller than average, threw an extra one in there."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-08-07,5,"This place is just so great. There aren't many coffee shops in the neighborhood where you can feel comfortable working (and get a great quiche while your at it.) The coffee and pastries are delicious, the staff is really friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is cozy. What more can you ask for?"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-07-24,5,"A friend suggested this coffee shop to study since I needed to do some grocery shopping at Trader Joe's in the neighborhood. Boule & Cherie had quality coffee, outlets, a wide variety of pastries and quiches, WiFi, AND a bathroom! It was a great spot to get some studying done. It got kind of crowded on a Sunday afternoon, but actually not as bad as some other NYC coffee shops I have been to. Would definitely come again!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-07-01,2,"Ordered a quiche 'to go' and when I arrived home later and decided to heat it up for
my dinner, they had put salad all over the top - making the quiche taste like salad
dressing and the crust all soggy and also tasting like salad dressing! What a waste
of money! 

Girls are not too bright at the counter to do such a thing!  Won't go back."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-06-29,2,"This used to be my go to place to get a cup of coffee and do work, but the last couple of times I've been here, they have played really loud music. The music is meant to be low-key, ambience kind of music, but I can literally feel the bass vibrations through the floor. I can even hear it over the music playing in my headphones. What's worse, is they must be playing the music via a free spotify account or something because there are advertisements! I find it almost impossible to do any work here now. Too bad"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-03-29,4,"Their GOLDEN LATTE, a mix of turmeric and ginger, is so much yum !!! Granted I tend to like ginger regardless so those who don't like to taste it might not enjoy the earthiness this unusual flavor brings. 

A lot of seating, so I was able to find a place to work even when it was a crowded hour. Woohoo!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-03-13,4,Great coffee & pastries! I regularly come here since I live nearby. Cute rustic/industrial decor. Great local neighborhood cafe. The staff could be friendlier.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-03-12,3,"Their price was a little much for a small latte-8 oz, but it was yummy so, I rest my case. They could spend a couple minutes cleaning up people's trash from the counter and wiping tables so others could sit. I had to find the only seat available that wasn't surrounded by trash or an unclean table. That's my only recommendation."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-02-25,4,"Super fun study spot with decent coffee and snacks to keep you fueled. Free wifi and the music is a bit throwback/present day top 40s so bring some headphones if you aren't into that. Also a great spot to have a cute coffee date or to catch up with friends. I seriously love how versatile this spot is. Thank goodness they have a bathroom. There are outlets, but not many so watch out for that if you need power. I also love their gorgeous, flashy sign."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-02-12,3,I wish the staff can pay more attention to the customers... like less chatting with each other and remember what the customer ordered... can't beat the location.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2017-01-22,4,"Needed to get out of the apartment to do some work and always pass by this coffee shop on my way to Trader Joe's.

The ambiance here is really nice. There is a good amount of seating and people seem to come and go quickly. I have been able to get a lot of work done and enjoy watching people walk by. There are a good amount of power outlets if you need to charge up. 

The coffee is nothing that special. I ordered a skim latte. The design is a little sloppy, but I am not one to care about that too much. 

The wait was a bit long and the employee making the coffee was not too friendly, but otherwise a good place to come and get some work done or even socialize with a friend."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-12-30,5,"Great Place !!
The delicious coffees are only surpassed by their warm, courteous and friendly service. 
Wonderful selection of pastries and unique sandwiches."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-12-28,4,"Earlier reviews say the Wi-Fi is spotty, but I've never had a problem. I really like the zucchini muffin, and you can never go wrong with Stumptown coffee. The quiches are okay, but too often are not heated properly. Staff is pleasant, but not especially outgoing."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-12-16,5,"Great ambience, music could be a little quieter, always get a seat and the coffee is great."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-12-09,2,NOT an espresso spot! Very weak and milky cappuccino. Quiche was ok and nutella danish was very good.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-11-05,4,"Good coffee, very good pastries and charming, friendly and helpful service. Pair that with reasonable prices and you get a four star experience."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-11-01,5,"My go to place for Stumptown and snacks. Not to noisy, good spot to collect one's thoughts."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-10-07,1,"Great coffee and great menu but serves was terrible. I never heard ""Hi!, ""How are you? ""Welcome! ""Or ""Thank you! Also Always girl has bad attitude."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-10-03,4,"Great menu, okay prices. I liked the seating arrangement both inside and out. Coffee tastes great. Some interesting food items like the empanadas and guava bun which make me think this must have South American influence one way or another.

I had a few issues with the service by all levels but I'd rather not get into it so no one loses a job over it. Not enough to make a mountain out of, but enough for me not to come back. I also have some issues with the layout of the accoutrements bc of the logjam that is created there and also no water available freely. It is a busy place with just the minimal staff (on a weekend morning, at least), so I shouldn't have to ask the staff for things like water. 

Solid place but I won't be back bc Blue Cafe is close and I like their people on both sides of the floor better there (less tourists). Soooo much better than Starbucks though."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-09-22,4,"I have zero idea why this place was receiving only a 3.5 star rating on Yelp, at least based on my experience today, it is worth a 4, if not higher. They punctually opened at 7, quickly served my espresso; space was huge and bright, a chilled vibe; carried stumptown coffee beans, served freshly baked goods with various selections. 

Would love to come back and try the matcha latte. A secret hidden gem in UWS."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-08-23,1,This place has such potential it's too bad nothing is fresh at 10 o'clock in the morning.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-08-18,5,"I like this place a lot, best coffee around!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-07-24,4,"A very cute coffee shop and bakery tucked away on Amsterdam! Easy to miss unless you're looking for it, Boule and Cherie is an adorable spot in this area. 

Great for coffee (Stumptown!), pastries (they have alllll sorts) or something savory (the frittatas and quiches are fantastic, well priced and served with delicious salad), Boule and Cherie is a solid place to add to the rotation. 

I had the spinach quiche ($7.50) which came with salad and was awesome. My friend had the feta frittata ($4.50) which also came with that yummy  salad. A great deal - with drinks the lunch for 2 came out to $20! 

The shop is spacious with a nice area of outdoor seating and of course they have free wifi. Many here come with a book, laptop or newspaper and enjoy some productive work time over coffee."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-07-04,5,"Great cute coffee shop with great variety of coffee/tea beverages. 
It also carries amazing almond croissants and quiches.
I order the plantain and latin quiche and fell in love with it (only $9 and it comes with salad).
The people at the counter were also very nice and patient."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-06-17,2,"I was really excited when a new non-chain coffee place opened up in my neighborhood. The space is cute, but the pastries and coffee are really disappointing. I gave it a few tries, hoping the overly dry croissants and bad latte was an one off, but sadly, the pastry is never fresh (even when I specifically ask if it's fresh) and the coffee is never done right. I will have to go elsewhere."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-06-12,5,Great pastries and sandwiches! It's a nice addition to the neighborhood for a quick coffee and snack.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-05-16,4,"Nice selection. Super clean because it's new. Much higher ""cool factor"" than pop-up fake euro bakery coffee places. Nice decor. Stumptown beans always better quality than the home of the burnt beans (rhymes with Starbucks). 
Outdoor seating nice on a warm day."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-05-08,5,"I live around the area and this is my favorite cafe in the 10 block radius by far. Great atmosphere, good coffee, and really great pastry selection. Service is great too and has that cozy non-chain feeling about the cafe."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-05-04,4,"ADORABLE!
Such a sunny place for some coffee and muffins :)"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-05-03,3,"Great location and they have matcha, but the wi-fi never lets you connect... forget about coming here to get work done. Such a tease."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-04-26,5,"Boule and cherie used the best quality ingredients in eveything they sell. 
Their coffee is top notch. Their puff pastry is made with pure butter, organic flower, and french recipes. 
It opened a few months ago. I think boule and cherie will soon be one of ny's favorite coffee pastry places."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-04-11,3,"This has become my local coffee shop on my NYC Vacation (it is around the corner) They do a half decent coffee and nice baked muffins, pastries and sandwiches."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-03-19,2,Basic French bakery....visit several times...BUT they advertise free Wi-Fi and the WiFi usually does not work....not a good place to email or study
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-03-14,4,"On the corner of Amsterdam and 68th of the restaurant and cafe wasteland that is midtown, there lies a small glimmer of hope that is Boule and Cherie. It's quite large and spacious for a cafe, especially when you compare it to nearby competitors such as Joe Coffee and Indie. Lots of seating, tables and even a couch with a relatively chill environment makes this a pretty good study and hang kind of place. There could stand to be a few more outlets but on a regular day it's not too bad to nab a spot that has easy access to one.

My personal preference here is stick to just the coffee, they use Stumptown (and even have their cold brew) are pretty good at their drip brew, not too shabby on their espresso based drinks, and the pricing isn't too bad either. The food could stand to have a bit of improvement; the pastries and quiche are okay but nothing to run home and celebrate about.

What you may run out and celebrate about is an actual space to relax, converse without yelling, and do some work without having to worry about prying eyes trying to steal your seat."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-03-09,5,"I would give 5 starts for mom-daughter, nanny-child, and/or babysitter-child spot!  Big, small tables where you children can do their homework while you can also chill with cup of coffee.  They serve fancy coffee and hot chocolate -- and some great pastries.  It's near music academy and ps 133 and other kids institutions so it's perfect for caregivers and children!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-02-29,1,"Perfect place!

That is if your looking for cuisine which you may find on the Appalachian train in some tavern circa 1873, and decor which is so wonderfully pleasant that on any given stormy overcast day; thinking your in a sleek cafe of Stockholm. That will be of course until you hear snooty women gossiping audibly, the unclean tables in front of you, and a quiche which the properly heated holding the warmth in its crust, as its soggy center makes you regret what looked as the most pleasant choice!

Horrid!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-02-23,5,I came to B&C on a Sunday afternoon to get some work done. The place is brightly lit and comfortable. I mostly wanted to leave a review to note that the latte here is VERY good!
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-02-22,3,"This bright, flashy space on Amsterdam really underwhelmed with its selection (everything was stocked yet nothing looked appealing), and the two staffers were absolutely flabbergasted by my question as to what the brownies nearest the register were (seemed to be s'mores but they just kept mumbling marshmallow brownie with no confirmation or denial of my suspicion). Went with the $4.08 special pain au chocolat, which was fine, but far from encouraging a return.

Appears on CC with an extra ""R"" -- BOULE & CHERRIE"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-02-06,4,"Me and my party of 5 were at Starbucks 2 blocks north of here and there was not a seat to be had. We then went to Boule and Cherie and found a bright roomy venue with plenty of seating. The cold weather prompted us to have the hot chocolate and the hot cider, both of which were very delicious. My Chai latte was every bit as good as Starbucks. Best of all there was no problem lingering there enjoying our drinks while enjoying the company of friends."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-02-06,5,"Five stars because I'm so happy there's a coffee shop by me with substantial food options! Crusty bread for the caprese and the widest selections of quiches I've ever seen. I can't wait to try! The slices are huge unlike some places. They have a salmon salad for under $10 and empanadas to share as well as a Brie croissant sandwich! You definitely have my vote and business, new neighbor :)"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-01-27,3,"Hypes: 
- cute quality new coffee shop on the UWS in an area that's close to residential apartments!
- stumptown beans
- they make a quality latte 
- good assortment of pastries, savory snacks, and food (rarity for coffee shops on uws)
- nice area to sit and do work

Gripes:
- great coffee and pastries but nothing exceptional

Tip: All the pastries are 50% off after 6pm!"
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-01-25,4,"Great food at very reasonable prices. I had the spinach quiche with a small side salad. Pleasing to the eye and palatte.  Also got a kombucha.  I like their unique selection of bottled drinks.   It was the perfect place to lull me into spending too much on pretty tasty things!! Looking forward to return for their stumptown coffee drinks!  

Bathroom is clean and spacious. Ample comfy seating. The day I went, the heat was unbearably intense and the wifi didn't work (hence the 4 stars), but I'm sure another day they'd be fine.  Otherwise great place to chat or study as the lighting is good and ambient noise minimal."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-01-16,3,"Coffee's good but handled inconveniently if you take both milk and sweetener.  They're in different places, with stirrers only by the sweeteners.  Peanut butter cookie actually tasted a little stale."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2016-01-14,4,"Great drip coffee (Stumptown). Also free wifi and multiple outlet options, which can be hard to find!Pastries looked good but I was boring and resisted the sweets."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2015-12-30,4,New cafe on Amsterdam and 68th. Use  stumptown beans for their coffee/espressos - I got a cappuccino which was pretty good. Good seating area to chat with a friend or do some reading. Excited to try one of their pastries next time!
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2015-12-23,3,"Walk, don't run to the newest eat in cafe on the UWS. it's a cute spot on glam starved Amsterdam. There are mini sandys for $3.81, I had two - a tuna and a ham and cheese. They were fresh and good. I tried the cookies- also good, but nothing mind blowing here, just a nice neighborhood cafe. Expect the expected and a nice spot to meet for a coffee, a chat & a chew."
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2015-12-21,3,Good place for coffee but how does the batista stop my order and finish someone else's? It's one of my biggest pet peeves especially when I have to remind them to finish my order. It was just an iced americano.
245,boule-and-cherie-new-york,2015-12-16,5,I think this new place is great. Perfect for a Coffee & Croissant breakfast. I would definitely go back.
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2020-01-03,5,"This is so good!!! I tried the chocolate pecan coffee, just black. Full of flavor, not overly sweet. All the flavor from the bean, not a syrup, and so fresh! I'm gonna need to make some trips to the Uws for some beans to bring back to Brooklyn! Hooray for mom and pop shops!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2019-05-09,1,"Best chai in the neighborhood, if they'll actually make it for you. And that seems to depend entirely on who's working there and how they feel, unfortunately. I've come in a handful of times at different hours only to be told variations of the machine is ""not working"" or ""not ready."" I've asked if they stop serving at a certain time, or if they stopped making chai, and they've assured me neither is the case. I can only conclude that this person simply can't be bothered, or worse, decides who they want to make drinks for or not. It's a shame. I'm local and would be here daily if this wasn't the case."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2018-08-14,5,"Whatever your preference, this place has something for you.. I guarantee. The flavored coffee and teas are blended in house with all natural ingredients. You name it, they probably have it. The gentleman who helped us with our selections was so knowledgeable and friendly. He was eager to answer all of our questions and provided us with more than enough information about our selections. We left extremely happy that we found such a cool spot for unique/delicious caffeine choices! (Tons of herbal/decaf selections too-- if that's your thing.) This place will be a must-stop whenever we're near from now on."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2018-07-02,5,"The Sensuous Bean is my new favorite coffee place. It's a combination of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and TED Talk. You get the deep knowledge of coffee bean connoisseurs who obviously love their jobs along with the insane variety that comes from their densely packed store. The choice of coffees is staggering. Take one look at their menu replete with flavors and you'll get dizzy. That's even before you start monkeying around with blends...

I had no idea what I wanted, but after talking with the guys, they properly gauged my tastes and pointed me toward the Italian-Venezuelan blend. Luckily, they already had some brewed for me to try and its robust flavor was exactly what I needed.

I only got one bag, but I know for a fact I'll be coming back to this lovely place to sample some of their other incredible beans."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2018-07-02,5,"Quite possibly the best place in the city to pick up fresh coffee beans or get a selection of beans ground to your preference. 

The selection is absolutely mind-boggling and choosing any single one among the many is not a simple task. The smell is almost overwhelmingly comforting to anyone who is a coffee lover. 

I recently picked up a few bags of coffee and came back to bring a friend to get him some high quality grounds for his new chemex. 

I'm Cuban, we tend to drink mostly espresso, but I love to try and taste new flavors and all sorts of old blends. This place is basically like Disneyland for someone like me who loves extreme variety.  

What's more...they have a wonderful selection of fresh and organic teas from all over the world. So if coffee isn't necessarily your thing, but tea is? This is still the right place to come and check out. 

If you find yourself in the upper west side, stop in and grab yourself a bag. You will thank me for it."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2018-06-21,5,"Upon walking into The Sensuous Bean you're hit with the mesmerizing aroma of coffee and chocolate. This place is winning before you even try or buy anything.

This tiny shop is packed with shelves of freshly roasted coffee beans and loose teas. They offer everything from light to dark roast (but why would you ever go for dark roast?), light to heavy body, traditional flavors to eccentric flavors (all natural, house-made flavoring, not that chemical tasting crap).  I'm not too well-versed in tea but there was a wide variety to choose from. My first time it took me forever to choose a coffee bean because everything looked great.

The service is fantastic too. The staff gives good recommendations based on your preferences, provides helpful advice for brewing, and lets you taste some brewed blends. They're patient and a pleasure to talk to.

My go-to order is 1/2 lb of classic beans (house blend, Colombian, etc.) and 1/2 lb of a ""eccentric"" beans (vanilla, Almond Joy, etc.). As a local, this will definitely be my regular coffee roaster in the UWS.

There are also treats and high quality dark chocolate on the sides of the shop. I might grab some of the 70%+ bars in the future."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2018-03-26,5,"Hands down best coffee on the UWS.  Every time I fly home, I'm basically not allowed into the house until I prove that I've brought some Sensuous Blend with me.  This place is the real deal!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2017-12-26,5,"Best coffee around. We've been addicted to their hazelnut for years. After moving away (sadly!), we have them ship our coffee! It arrives in a matter of days. Service is always prompt. LOVE this place."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2017-11-10,5,"The Colombian excelso and Mexican altura beans are my favorites here. There's a great selection of single origin coffees. These two in particular are great medium roast coffees with bold flavors. 

Their signature blend is also really interesting. I had never tried anything like it before and would recommend it to people who love coffee and want to try something new. One of the people working there also encouraged me to try Haitian coffee for the first time. I had not been anywhere that carried it before, and I would recommend it."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2017-06-04,1,This coffee store looked so enticing I could not resist going in. The people are nice and the ambiance fine. The coffees on special at the front of the store were priced around $24 a lb. which seemed high. The aroma was that of flavorings heavy on the hazelnut light on the Java. That should have warned me off. I bought a large coffee (10 oz.) Kenya blend. Lukewarm and minimal flavor. Maybe it is a good place to buy beans but not for brewed coffee.
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2017-04-29,5,My absolute favorite mom and pop coffee spot. They let you sample all of the daily coffees. Staff is extremely knowledgeable and they have an amazing selection to take home and brew your labels. Long live the bean.
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-08-14,5,Amazing coffee! I come here for both my beans and for coffee to go. They have great bean flavors and awesome iced coffee!
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-07-31,5,Excellent cup of coffee and friendly customer service. Wish they had a place closer to my apartment in Chelsea though so I could swing by more often. I had the dark roast drip and really liked it. I will be back for more.
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-07-15,4,"I went yesterday because as I was walking east on 70th street toward the lark, the aroma was just scrumptious.  I wish the coffee was a bit stronger and ""deeper"" but overall it was great and the store is super cute and really old NY"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-06-12,5,"Awesome variety of different roasts and flavors...right out where you can pull off the lids and take a whiff of the magic. Very cramped and no space really to hang around inside to have your coffee, but great little spot to get some fun beans and grab a cup on the go.

The iced coffee came in three different roasts/flavors, too---most places you just get the one iced coffee option. I had the medium roast with a splash of cream and it was very good."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-06-10,5,"I moved to New York a year ago and was excited to discover this coffee shop. I usually come by once a month stock up on ground coffee beans for my stove top percolator at home. So far my favorite is a medium roast called The Haitian. I also enjoyed a Mocha Java medium roast and am currently sipping a very robust and flavorful Venezuelan coffee. Delicious!

The staff has always been very friendly and helpful. I often tell them what I enjoyed and ask them for recommendations and they are accommodating. Just yesterday they were scooping out various dark roasts for me to smell as well as discussing my preferred acidity level. They have never seemed annoyed or put out by my interest in exploring each coffee. I settled on a dark roast called Venezuela Maracata that they recommended to me. It is a great place to explore a wide variety of coffee.

They use a punch card system and I look forward to filling it up over the next few months."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-05-30,4,"This is an incredibly quirky store. I love it.  So the protection gate is halfway up. The lights are off. I walk up anticipating the opening. The worker pops out his head and says Hey, I will probably open at 8:30 today. I let him know that I was camped out at the Muffin store across the street, waiting to get a pound of Butter Rum. O well then. Just watch your head. It's 8 am, or thereabout. In seconds, he grinds the beans, punches my loyalty card, and reminds me again to 'watch my head.' And went back to doing whatever he was doing. That would never happen at a Starbucks."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-05-21,5,"Aromatic, flavorful without over baked burning taste! Finally find my espresso spot in NYC."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-05-19,5,"Best Soy Chai in the Upper West Side. I think there was only one time where it wasn't yummy but one time out of the 30 times I've been here isn't too bad at all. Iced or hot, it's amazing. 

My husband is a fan of Starbucks Coffee and sometimes tries to get me to get their Soy Chai instead of strolling over to The Sensuous Bean but I always refuse it. The Soy Chai at The Sensuous Bean shits on the one at Starbucks in my opinion. 

The staff is always very friendly and mellow which is my kind of crowd. Even the customers are friendly. Sometimes there's a little bit of a wait but I'm cool with that because the Soy Chai is well worth it. Plus it smells so delicious inside."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-05-07,4,"Best hazelnut coffee I've ever had. Wish it would stay open later, hard to get here during the work day for beans. But I'm now a loyal customer."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-04-22,2,"If you're serious about coffee, this place is not for you. They have a huge variety of flavored beans that assault your nose when you walk in; cream was unrefrigerated on the counter; the (friendly and welcoming) guy made a sub-par latte with bubbles up top when I asked for a cappuccino. This may be the first coffee place I've been where the espresso machine is in the back rather than where you can see it. I've now lost my faith in the subway coffee map and zagat, which both reviewed this place well. One star each for friendliness and having (probably stale) Swiss water decaf."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-01-10,4,Friendly staff. Great coffee. We by our beans here. Please go and keep our local neighborhood operators in business.
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2016-01-09,5,Just love my cup of coffee home when I can't be in the upper West side..take a bag with you...The staff is extremely nice and helpful next time you're in need for a cuppa coffee on the upper West side check them out shop small shop local skip the Starbucks
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2015-12-17,5,"After reading the reviews on yelp, I hopped on the bus in the pouring rain, endured listening to a bratty, entitled, spoiled, screaming kid (best birth control ever!) who punched his sister in the nose while other riders watched in horror and repeatedly told his nanny that he was going to get her fired in rain to buy some coffee beans to give as Christmas gifts.  Stressed from the bus ride, I walked into the wonderful aroma of coffee beans and the most knowledgeable and patient man who gave the most wonderful suggestions on what to give as gifts (a blend of venezuelan and italian roast) and lady hannah tea.   And he even understood what grind the coffee need with my wild gesturing of trying to explain a stovetop percolator my old school italian friends use.  I can't wait to go back."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2015-11-08,4,"This place feels like a truly hidden gem on the UWS amidst the multitude of chain coffee shops.  Upon opening the door the rich coffee smell engulfs you and at least for me drew me inside.

It is tiny - everywhere you look are barrels are coffee beans. I had wanted to try one of their roasts there instead of at home and discovered you can get a self serve cup of drip coffee - they brew 3-4 varieties each day.  I had the hazelnut which was lovely, rich coffee notes with a sweet hazelnut flavor and an overall buttery quality.  I also tried the amaretto which was surprisingly very almondy.  I didn't get beans that day but plan to come back and buy some.  I really like that you can smell each of the options and how knowledgable the staff is.

Only downside is that it is very, very small and there's sadly no room, except two small stools, to enjoy the coffee inside, so it's really only a to go option."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2015-09-23,5,"This is my favorite coffee store in the world :) 
for the past 3+ years this in the only place I buy my beans (blueberry is my favorite!) unless I just cant get there in time and must go elsewhere (sigh...). I even had some shipped to me while working in Eastern Europe last year :) plus the staff is great!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2015-09-05,2,I can only speak for the espresso...basically threw it out and went to buy another one from a store across the street
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2015-03-18,5,"""Where everybody knows your name"" This is THAT coffee shop. Adorable little place, with different selections everyday, great treats and fantastic teas. 

Sharon, Mark & Tom are so friendly, make great suggestions for you when you can't decide and always offer my dog a treat 

Great place and a staple in the neighborhood :)"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2015-02-01,3,"This tiny shop on the upper west side can make a proper espresso or latte, serves coffee, lets you indulge in some tasty cookies, or buy any one of a zillion flavors of tea or coffee in bulk. Sitting here to hang out is not the idea though. While there are three stools and a tiny bench, you are in the way of the next customer to drop by. So, get your coffee and go! That's what we did!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2015-01-13,4,"I'll admit it, the only reason I chose this coffee shop is because I think the name is sexy as hell. The Sensuous Bean. I feel dirty just saying it. Rawr

Okay anyways, these guys serve up some pretty decent coffee. Sadly I only got to try their hazelnut coffee since they shut down their machinery at a certain point of the day, so no lattes for Sean. Kinda sucked that it was from a dispenser, which is why it's only a 4 star shop for me, but at least it was hot and fresh, since the worker there replaced it right as we came in.

Love that they've got a huge variety of different coffees select from. If I was a coffee connoisseur I'd definitely be in heaven over here. It's almost intimidating walking in here and seeing their level of inventory.

Their shop is super tiny though. I feel like I've been in cars with more space than they've got in here. Almost every nook and cranny is filled with some sort of coffee device. Felt like I was gonna clumsily knock something over every move I made.

Anyways, it's a solid stop for either a quick cup of coffee or if you're a coffee collector elitist."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2015-01-07,5,"Great everything! The smell is so good. I asked by here and wanted something hot to drink. Best chair latte I've ever had. The place is small but it's good for everything. Tasted all the drops out (4) and couldn't decide between them so I got chair instead. If I'm ever back in the area, I'll stop by again for sure."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-10-05,5,"This IS the small neighborhood coffee shop you have been looking for!  If you want commercial, trendy, trite, common or basic goto Starbucks.  I get my coffee here many mornings & have been for years, because I appreciate the quality, character & knowledge I find in this quaint shop.  I can't speak of what I don't know but I will share what I do know.....

-Coffee in ""coffee dispenser"" (also known as a carafe if one's vocabulary is a little broader) is NOT scalding hot...but it's not cold.  HINT: ask them to steam it and they will gladly do so.
-the FRESH coffee beans are not in ""bins"" but rather actual barrels-adding to the character of this place. Yep, they are low to the ground... as are refrigerators, couches, dachshunds..... 
-Has this business been in the neighborhood forever??? Well, archaelolgists have yet to carbon date it but, yes, it is a business that has been a neighborhood shop...which means they must be doing something right if they have survived when it was a dicey area, in a bad economy, inflation, etc.
-Does it have an UWS snobby vibe to it.....well, the walls are neon green, the prices are reasonable, and it's NOT a chain, so really it does NOT have a snobby vibe.  
-Yes bring cash if you aren't going to spend more than $7 because they do not accept cards for small amounts...of course we all know that is because BANKS charge them a fee for every transaction they send thru...so do the math....it makes sense.
-Staff:  4 very different personalities, all equally nice & helpful.  Do they eat in the shop...yep...it's called lunch.  They stay in the shop...to help customers.  I guess some people think waitstaff should not eat at all???

BOTTOM LINE: if you are looking for CHARACTER (did I mention the walls?) and QUALITY (always fresh brew & beans) and VARIETY (chocolate chip pancake flavored coffee...whhaaaattttt?) then this is your place, stop and get a cup of joe. This is not Starbucks....thank god!!!!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-09-22,5,"Great coffee. Great pastries. I'll definitely be returning when I make my way up to the UWS again. 

Upon walking in you're slapped in the face with the aroma of coffee, or should I say caressed? From a simple glance it appears like the place focuses on roasting or simply the selling of beans. However, they do keep 4 roasts of coffee in dispensers for the folks that have the itch to scratch. 

The pastries and cookies are amazing! I was not expecting them to be as good as they were--definitely snag a few or 10 while you're there. 

I will be returning!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-08-08,5,"This little coffee shop is major find. There are so many options! The coffee was affordable and delicious. Great service, friendly and helpful. I will definitely be going back there!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-07-31,5,"I don't even like coffee, but the aroma in this place is amazing. The owner treated me to a free chocolate cover salt caramel and it was great! Nice people, good coffee smell! My girlfriend for the coffee. She loved it!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-07-29,5,"The smell alone deserves 5 stars, it is delicious!!!  I got a large iced dark roast coffee and the man working was very polite and humored me with my 'what is your favorite coffee' questions.  The iced coffee is delicious and I definitely will be back!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-07-24,2,"This place was a DUD.  Yelpers really let me down!

Coffee is in a dispenser and is NOT HOT and it is NOT FRESH.  There are coffee beans everywhere in bins low to the ground and they allow dogs inside of the store. Illegal AND disgusting.

I took one sip of my cold, bitter coffee and threw it in the trash.  

Definitely not my kind of place...."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-07-16,3,"For a few months I went there every week to splurge on a bag of their $18 a pound Italian Roast, because I love dark, strong coffee that much. One time when I got home and brewed it, it was weak and tasteless. Thinking they gave me the wrong beans, I had them grind me a new bag. That tasted just as bad, at which point they admitted that these beans were old and a new shipment would come in next week so I should come back then. They were pleasant enough through the ordeal but where's their quality control? Fresh dark-roast beans should look oily and these were dry, so why were they trying to get away with selling them in the first place? Either that or they don't even know about the one product they sell. I lost my respect for them and stopped going there after that. Yes, you can usually get high quality coffee beans there but buyer beware!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-05-23,4,"Great, fresh iced coffee at a fair price. I'll come back and buy coffee beans."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-05-22,5,Prices are good. Advice is great and the selection is fantastic.
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-05-18,4,"If I lived nearby, I would totally pick up a cup of joe from here everyday. It's small, unassuming, and does the one thing it's known for well. It's a quick in and out and you're on your way onto the rest of your busy New York lives. The guy manning the counter was friendly and cordial. If you're concerned about the self serve setup and that the coffee sits in dispensers, worry not! Enough people come through this little store that they go through and refill the dispeners frequently enough with fresh stuff."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-05-15,2,"This place feels like it has been in the neighborhood forever. It also has a snobby uws vibe to it.

It's impossible to move once you step inside, especially if there are any other customers in there with you. The place is really the size of a walk-in closet filled with boxes of different types of coffee beans for you to purchase.

In the center they have a table set up with 5 different types of pre-brewed coffee for you to serve yourself. The staff is usually eating or talking amongst themselves and does not seem friendly to new faces. 

It's also one of these places that has a minimum for credit card purchases, which is a joke for a place like this where on average people are spending no more than $7. So bring cash."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-05-06,5,"1. amazing name 2. amazing iced hazelnut!  I can't imagine going anywhere else for my iced coffee now.
Also props for letting us take some cups for our wine :)"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-04-26,5,"It smells great in here! Great service, high quality coffee drinks (the hazelnut iced coffee is delish!) and delicious cookies from a bakery in Brooklyn. A new fave of ours."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-04-15,5,"I keep hearing people complaining that the Upper West Side is becoming homogenized, filled with chains just like the rest of the city.  As they are sipping their Starbucks iced coffees.  
Guess what!!?? If you don't support local small businesses, they won't be able to compete with the corporate giants.  The Sensuous Bean is a gem of the Upper West Side.  The coffee is AMAZING, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  Keep them open-when you need a coffee fix, go here instead of to Starbucks!!!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-03-23,5,"Wife: l want to stop by the Sensuous Bean while we are in the UWS
Me: um, with the baby?!
Wife: yes, what else would we do with her?
Me: (maybe it's an LL Bean apparel place but strictly lingerie, no idea...but the baby? O well)
Wife: I just want to get a cup of coffee before we drive back downtown
Me:(so this place sells coffee and lingerie?!..ok I guess that makes sense)
Sure no problem
(Drive and park close by, walking to front door)
Me: O, ok (not sure what I was thinking, nice it's Zagat rated though - must be good)
(Inside store)
Wife: here try this
Me: what is this?
Wife: coffee, a few different blends
Me: *sip, *sip (taste) *chug, *chug *chug...awesome 
I'll take a box of the taxi shortbread cookies as well.
Wife: when we get downtown I want to stop by Victoria's Secret 
Me: um, with the baby?!
Wife: yes, what else would we do with her?"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2014-01-02,5,"So at first I was a bit skeptical of this place with its little ""pour yourself"" set-up, that looks more like a cute meeting room than a coffee shop, but the coffee is GREAT. We're here all the time, it's our first stop on our dog walk. 

Friendly service, good coffee."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2013-12-31,5,"There aren't many places to get good coffee beans in UWS.  There's Fairway, which has a good selection, and then there's Sensuous Bean that has an even better selection.  To top it off, the employees at Sensuous Bean know they're coffee and know their wares.  You can tell them what kind of flavor you want whether it be fruity, acidic, heavy, or bitter, they'll have a few suggestions for you.  What's even better is that they know when a particular batch of beans was shipped in and when it was roasted, which are key pieces of info when making your cup of coffee.

I've bought several pounds of coffee (and tea!) here as well as gotten cups from their thermoses and everything has been great."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2013-11-12,5,"Great, Great coffee... They have a wide selection of coffee beans from all over the world. The staff is extremely helpful and make wonderful blends-- their best being the house blend. You can also take coffee to go, at a very affordable price. They always have a dark roast, medium roast and a special flavored coffee.  I highly recommend this place!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2013-10-25,5,"Awesome, awesome coffee on the go. Great flavor and chill atmosphere. I'm super happy."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2013-10-21,5,"Amazing coffee- This family owned business is what NYC is about.  It's like a coffee boutique in there. 
Delicious gourmet blends of specialty coffees to go like, Pumpkin Spice, or Chocolate Butter Rum. They offer one brewed flavor to go a day .A large cup for $2.25 I love it!

Of course they sell all of the beans by the pound and will grind them for your coffee machine-
Hail to The Sensuous Bean : )"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2013-09-24,5,"No frills, no seating- just great coffee to go.  By far the best coffee in the neighborhood- I go several blocks out of my way just to start the day off right..."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2013-09-07,4,Ordered Tea & out it come a few minutes later... Great service if you're on the go... Don't plan on staying inside; it's small... But big enough to have everything you'd want
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2013-07-24,4,"The aroma just walking by is absolutely intoxicating. I love this little shop for their freshly ground beans in 100 delicious and unique flavors, but they have poor customer service. The woman behind the counter seemed almost upset I was there, and even though I left with a pleasant ""Thanks!"" it was returned with dead silence. I will definitely be back to get my favorite beans, but hope there's different sales person next time."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2013-04-18,2,I wanted to like this place more as I am a HUGE fan of supporting the local coffee places and they have been there for so long. The guy gave me a bit of attitude when I starting asking questions. Drinks were good... but turned off by the service. It does smell like heaven though...
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2013-04-04,5,Great coffee from tiny shop.  Hours seem irregular but the coffe is always good.
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2013-03-17,2,The products here are fine (if expensive) but the ambiance is deeply weird. Every time I walk in I feel like I am interrupting something. The staff are self-involved and uninterested in doing anything beyond the minimum. So I only go there for products I can't get elsewhere.
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2013-02-07,4,"Ignore the one star reviews, this is a shop to buy coffee or tea. It's not competing with coffee shops where you can sit and linger.Come in on any given day and regulars wander in, chat,  pick up their ground coffee or tea leaves for their home supply.
The Sensuous Bean on the Upper West Side of Manhattan is a must see, smell and taste New York experience. The tiny shop is filled with jars of coffee beans and loose tea leaves.The employees combine coffee flavors for you to take to go.The most recent coffee combination resulted in a flavored coffee called ,"" blueberry pancake"",which tastes great served with any pancakes! 
Don't forget to buy some delicious Hazelnut or Pistachio coffee beans, always great flavors!
 I purchased the Chocolate Mint Rooibos tea, Jasmine tea and many fruit varieties, all were very good! They will brew you a cup while you wait.
The shop is small, there is no seating inside, take your coffee or tea to go, sit on the bench outside or walk to Central Park and enjoy! It is a pleasure to see a small non franchise business thrive!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2012-11-28,1,I've had better coffee at Dunkin Donuts. Both times I went here I took a few sips and threw the rest in the trash as another poster her did as well. Although I've never bought coffee beans from here the general consensus seems to be they should stick to selling beans and not brewing anything in the store.
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2012-09-07,2,"I will give them props for very friendly service, but I must be spoiled by my Brooklyn hipster coffee joints because--blech--the iced latté I had was waterey, burnt-tasting and insufferably bad. Bummer."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2012-07-06,5,"This is exactly what you want out of a grab and go coffee stop.

I have gotten coffee here frequently which is delicious but its shining star in my opinion is the iced tea.  They will literally take any of their tea and make it iced for you on the spot. YUM! I had the mint chocolate rooibos which was divine and plan to go back to try more. 

The two guys working the register were really chill too which never hurts!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2012-07-06,3,"Came to this tiny coffee shop to grab some espresso. The cappuccino tasted...different -- the espresso wasn't bad or anything but just not the taste I prefer. It was also kind of weird how their espresso machine is hiding in some backroom where you can't see what they are doing.

The coffee bean selection makes this place worth visiting again though. The beans I got made for some pretty good morning coffee."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2012-06-08,4,Great coffee bean but leans towards pricey side. Brewed coffee is very cheap and very strong.
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2012-02-19,3,"The coffee selection seems pretty great, and the store smells amazing. Not too impressed with the tea selection, though - mostly black tea, with a few herbal/fruit teas, but nothing particularly exotic. The herbal tea I purchased (""blue eyes"") was nice, but for tea, I think you could find equivalent quality with better selection at other places."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2012-02-18,3,"I liked this store a lot. It had a decent selection of coffee, the service was good and they make very good recommendations."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2012-01-19,3,"So tiny! Just a little shop selling coffee beans, who additionally have about 5 carafes of pre-brewed coffee (1 decaf, 4 not). I wandered in for a cup of coffee this morning after browsing reviews. It's self serve and a good cup of coffee for $1.75. No seating at all, just a place to purchase your own beans or to take out a cup to go. 

Note: they only accept credit card for purchases over $7."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2011-12-19,3,"After living in the area for a few years, I finally made it in here a couple of weeks ago. I didn't drink any of the coffee, I was there to purchase some whole beans as a gift. There were two employees there, I was the only other person in the store and yet they barely greeted me. They seemed preoccupied and when I asked them what they might recommend for someone who likes a,b, and c they did not go out of their way to be helpful. I was disappointed by this - I like to shop local, but just because you're local doesn't mean you don't have to help your customers. It was like they didn't even care anyone was there.

I did like the dozens of selections of coffee. I also liked that when I made my purchase they have a ""frequent buyer card"" - you get a stamp for every pound of coffee you buy and after 5 you get 1/2 pound(?) for free, after 10 stamps you can get 1 pound free. I will most likely give them another try to see if their service was just a little 'off' that day."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2011-09-14,5,"A GREAT coffee store - with DEEP, long roots on the UWS. I've shopped here since I was a kid, and grew up nearby (and went to school a few blocks away). The current owners  - who've been involved for many years - have a terrific knowledge of the beans,, and a great rapport within the area."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2011-08-27,4,"The house blend coffee here is mild and does not hit your stomach with a sledgehammer ... and the little pastries are quite delicious.

I could not decide which one I wanted--they all looked so good.

Though there was no real seating in the store to enjoy my goodies ...

I can see at first glance why they stand up well to Starbucks ..."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2011-08-06,4,I love this cute little place... nice people working there and a really interesting selection of teas and coffees. smells great inside!
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2011-07-02,5,"Pecan. Cinnamon Roll. just 2 of the amazing, unique coffee flavors i've had at this hidden little coffee shop in the 70's on the UWS. i love walking in, especially on a chilly fall or winter morning, to grab a cup of whatever the flavor of the day happens to be. The only downside of this place is that its tiny, so there is no seating. Otherwise i could sit there and smell the delicious coffee all day. this place is a gem."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2011-06-05,3,"I really, really wanted to fall in love with this place. I kind of already had before I ever even went inside - it has got its vibe so finely tuned... Everything from the old school lettering on the awning, to the hand painted beans on the side, to the bench, to the colorful display of teas and stuff that clutter the little space... to the sweet aroma seeping out into the sidewalk... dammit, I even love the name. The Sensuous Bean... I was practically scribbling it in my Biology notebook next to my name in a little heart.

Buuut... the two times I've gone to The Sensuous Bean I've found the drip coffee in the thermoses to be lukewarm - presumably from sitting out too long. The cause of this problem is the sheer variety of thermos stored coffee they make available to you, (four, I think?). It's the same problem a pizzeria has offering too many specialty slices, (lookin' at you, Two Boots) they simply get cold.

Come to The Sensuous Bean to buy some beans to brew at home or to get an espresso, but don't bother with those thermoses... they will break your heart and leave you at home watching Say Anything with a box of tissues while all the other coffee drinkers are at coffee-prom with their hot, fresh cups of coffee."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2011-03-15,5,"Heavenly...just walking in this tiny gem of a coffee shop on Manhattan's UWS is worth the trip.  The staff is friendly and they know everything about their coffees.  There's usually even a local or two just hanging out in the shop, chatting with the owners, or sitting on a stool basking in the roasted aroma bliss.  This place is as real as it gets!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2011-02-23,3,"This is some strong ass coffee. They have a few options always brewing and tons of coffee beans to choose from, which they will grind to perfectly fit your at home coffee machine. I like to just walk in here and wake up from the smell. mmmm."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2010-12-13,2,"The service is so rude and unhelpful - which is very weird for a specialist store like this.

I could live with that for great coffee but it was anything but that - I would say average at best. Somewhat on par with Starbucks, which is not a compliment."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2010-08-24,3,"Cute  , place,  great  coffe  selection , but  the  oddest, rudest  staff.  I  think  if your e  a regular, then they  may  warm up to you but no  hlep even  when you ask.

The woman  seemed  as if  she  needed a  pot of  coffee, very  distracted, sleepy, frazzled and oblivious."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2010-07-10,4,"After a brief awkward greeting with the employee, who did not ask if he could help me but just said, ""Hi,"" I wasn't really sure if I was in the right place to order just a cup of coffee or tea.  Just walk in and you'll know what I mean-- the walls are artfully lined with rows and rows of big coffee bean and tea blend bins.  It seems like a place where they pack a bag of beans for you and you're on your way.

Once I discovered that I could, in fact, just get one serving, that's when the real expertise of this place was able to shine.  I told him the taste I was looking for (I was in the mood for iced tea), and he recommended not just one tea but a BLEND of two teas that he promptly mixed, brewed, and iced for me in back.  And it was exactly what I was looking for.

While he was making the tea, I decided to peer around at the coffee selection (which is bountiful).  I loved opening the bins and smelling the different flavors... raspberry, toffee, so many to choose from!  I'm not actually sure if I was allowed to smell them, but nobody was looking so I couldn't resist.

Looking forward to the next time I'm in the neighborhood and can go back.

One last quick note-- there is one bench outside the Sensuous Bean, but it does not provide seating otherwise."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2009-10-28,5,"The Senuous Bean happily grinds (free of charge) their fantastic selection of roast coffee beans for your personal coffee machine.   I'm a huge fan of Vienna and Kona.  

They offer free samples of four daily roasts available for the on-the-go pick-me-up.  Both the large selection of loose teas and coffee bean purchases qualify for their loyalty card progam (every 10th pound is free).  

Minus one star for their baked goods, which should be avoided at all cost.  Do yourself a favor and visit Soutine Bakery (on the same street) if you're after baked goods.  

The place has tons local New York charm.  I'm a fan!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2009-10-12,5,"Oh...how I loves me some flavored coffee...
And the Sensuous Bean delivers! Pumpkin Spice coffee? Coconut Carmel? The best darn Hazelnut coffee I've ever had? Yup, they have it all. I mainly come here for my beans, but it's always nice to pick up a cup as well."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2009-04-11,1,"The coffee beans are mediocre and overpriced.  The brewed coffee is awful and overpriced.  The service is totally unprofessional and unbelievably rude.  The only thing this place has going for it the fact that it's cute.  And, as your mama told you, cute is not enough!"
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2009-02-22,2,"From the outside, this place looks like it should be a great little neighborhood coffee shop. The only thing that lives up to expectations is the aroma when you walk into the closet-sized store. Other than that, the service is erratic at best and incompetent at worst, and the prices are too high. And there's only enough room for about 2 people to stand and wait for coffee 

If you're just getting drip coffee -- or if you're looking for a broad selection of beans -- then I can see the appeal of the Sensuous Bean. But if you want a cappucino, a latte, or a pleasant place to hang out, look elsewhere."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2009-02-08,4,I enjoy the brewed coffee from sensuous bean... they always have 4-5 varieties brewing and I have always been happy with my selection.  I make it a weekend treat almost every weekend!
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2009-02-08,4,"The Sensuous Bean is a cute little spot up the street from me, and I often stop there for a weekend cup of coffee when I'm feeling too lazy to brew my own.  They always have at least 3 different blends brewing, and it's fun to get to try different kinds of coffee you might not otherwise encounter.  Service is sweet, and a small coffee is $1.50.  A good deal in a neighborhood that generally lacks them."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2007-06-26,1,"I gave them 3 opportunities on various occasions to give me a drinkable cup, and they failed every time.  There goes a couple of bucks into the nearest trash can.  So disappointing, considering they're the only independent coffee shop on the UWS, as far as I know."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2007-03-30,4,"Mmmmmm morning coffee.

Their mainstay is selling whole beans, but they brew up three blends every morning. They make small pots so your coffee is always fresh and delicious.
There is never a line. I'm in and out in under two minutes most days. 

There is no seating so no one is hanging out and writing their novel. It's small and can only hold a few customers at a time. There are only minimal amount of sweet snacks, that in truth, aren't that good. 

Sensuous Bean is just there to sell coffee and it does a perfect job at that."
246,the-sensuous-bean-new-york,2006-10-28,4,"I feel like this place is the little coffee secret of everyone who lives around here, and while I'm not jealous per se (I do have my Empire after all - http://www.yelp.com/biz/pottIrE6qxmRRBoVwkXWHw), I know that when my husband and I (you know, the billionaire who looks like a cross between Brad Pitt and Jude Law) buy our brownstone on 74th between Columbus & Central Park West, we'll come here to get the best French Roast for our Bodum French Press.  That's for when we sip coffee on Sunday morning at the marbletop breakfast bar in our glorious kitchen while doing the crossword as the sun streams in through the bay windows...woah...sorry about that, got carried away.  

I love little neighborhood coffee places like this - good selection of roasts and loose teas and a friendly, chatty staff.  They always have four roasts available for the on-the-go pick-me-up, not to mention a nice little selection of chocolates at the register.  Minus a star for being a little bit cramped and a little bit frenzied, but that's what gives places local New York charm.  I'm a fan."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2020-07-07,5,"Came here at random and what a cute little hidden gem. Definitely gave me Downtown Brooklyn vibes. I ordered an iced mocha latte with an avocado toast to go. The two baristas working that day were very attentive and sweet. The girl working on the register asked me if I wanted to add an egg to my toast and I'm glad she suggested it! Service was reasonably quick. I waited by the door and the other barista brought my drink and toast to me. 

I normally add a lot of sweetener to my coffee but I didn't have to add anything. Just enough mocha to satisfy my taste buds and the avocado toast? .. I'm still dreaming about it honestly. I live a few blocks away from this place. Definitely one of my new spots to visit now."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2020-06-27,5,"I have been coming here during quarantine to grab some coffee because theirs is just exceptional! They are the reason why I am so obsessed w iced latte w oat milk now. Today, I tried their food because their backyard is already open and oh my, it was so good! I'm not a big fan of omelette but I loved it - such perfectly made. I can't wait to try their other stuff!! Plus everyone here is so kind and approachable. 

So if you want to go to Manhattan for an weekend outdoor brunch, save yourselves the trip and go to Parker instead. Love and support your neighborhood business!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2020-06-24,5,"Willie is the sweetest! Everything was delicious! Latte, omelette, pancakes, avocado toast, waffles , salad. A must go!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2020-05-30,5,"Wish I found this place sooner. Great coffee and Pastries. I tried the citrus mint ice tea and it's the perfect refreshing drink. Staff is super friendly. If you're in the area, do yourself the favor and stop by this hidden gem."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2020-01-08,5,"Hanging out with my baby sister at this local place. We just loved it! Cozy, not noisy at all. Perfect spot at the neighborhood."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-11-10,5,"I like this coffee spot. Found it by chance, wouldn't notice it just on the street though. We are missing this kind of places in the area. Great staff and coffee, nice, cozy big area in the back of the place. Good to come and work if you need this kind place. Like it"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-10-03,4,"I loved the interior. The latte was so smooth and huge and had beautiful latte art on it! It was so good, it did not need sugar! I'd definitely order it again. It was pretty big! I didn't like the coconut matcha donut because it was too sweet and not a real texture I enjoyed ( though it was made fresh, it was kind of hard) so I exchanged it for croissant that tasted a bit better. I'm glad the customer service was alright! The bathroom was kind of small but very nice. I ordered the spinach empanada which did not taste good. I've had much better empanadas at other cafes. All in all, 4 stars for the ambiance, delicious latte and barista who suggested I exchange my donut for a croissant. I'll definitely come back again and recommend you try it out. I did not try out the WiFi but people were working remotely from there.  Great place for a latte and and a book."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-08-24,5,"Found this local delight by chance while waiting for my usual place to open - but needed my coffer a bit more urgently. What a gem. The place is relaxed , the coffee excellent and the staff was a joy to deal with. Thank you Laura and Isabella for being welcoming. The food choices were somewhat limited - will hopefully get added to but the pane chocolate with mocha wasn't bad starters to the day."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-05-11,1,Tried it for the first time since it was close to home and it had good reviews but I wasn't impressed. No flavor in their turkey wrap at all. Was extremely dry and flavorless. Capuchino was okay. Its just a cute little place but they need to work on their menu and also their service.
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-04-13,5,"The WNY, North Bergen, Guttenberg area needs more coffee shops like this. It's a small coffee shop so it's easy to miss. It looks super small when you first walk in however it opens up to a cute space in the back. It's a railroad style coffee shop with a cozy area in the middle with a couch and a seat more for reading. There's more table and chairs in the back for those coffee shop computer people. The decor is really nice. I had an almond milk cappuccino which was very tasty. The espresso was of good quality and a nice latte art to top it off. They also have baked good that are reasonably priced. Definitely a nice spot to sit and chat, read, or get some work done."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-03-29,5,Great place to relax while drinking delicious coffee.I am a first timer who definately love to come back.
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-03-27,5,"This is the best coffee shop in the area. Delicious coffee made with care, great food, chill and modern atmosphere, local art on the walls, open mic/slam poetry/storytelling events, a real sense of community...This is the perfect neighborhood spot to work or just hang out. The neighborhood needed a place like this!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-03-19,4,"super cute cafe to study/work. pretty roomy with couches and smaller tables. so happy I found this place as I'm always looking for study cafes in the Hudson County area! 

One con- the food was not as vegetarian/vegan friendly as I would have liked. I'm not vegan, but try to eat as healthy and plant based as possible throughout the week. I was so hungry when I came here so I settled for the spinach empanada. it was so good, but it did have cheese and was so small for the steep price."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-02-18,5,"Found this place through Yelp. My gf and I were looking for a place to have breakfast or lunch. We walked in and were automatically impressed by how cute it was inside. The owner was very friendly and suggested something to eat. We had the waffle and turkey wrap. Both items were simple, fresh and delicious! We also order hot chai lattes. The space inside is quiet and pretty spacious. Great for doing work or studying or just enjoying coffee with a book. Definitely recommend!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-02-12,5,"Great little hidden gem off the beaten path in WNY. I was especially excited that they source their coffee beans from Brooklyn Roasting Company. If you know coffee this name should be known. Also I am a fan that they source all savory and sweet treats locally from other small businesses, and it's delicious . Excellent coffee and matcha beverages . Visit them and you will immediately convert from big industry coffee to local third wave local specialities . Keep up the great work Parker Cafe!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-01-09,5,"Terrific, local coffee house serving an increasingly gentrified neighborhood. Run with heart and soul by owner Michael and his dedicated staff. Much like the boutique decor, a place that exudes handcrafted taste, quality and consistency. Don't miss the lovely patio in the back. The rotating gallery of exhibits featuring local artists is intelligently curated."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2019-01-08,5,"If you love coffee this is the place to be! Great coffee and you can clearly see that the barista is very passionate about delivering quality coffee. Also they serve delicious pastries which is the cherry on the cake!!! 
Parker is definitely my favorite coffee shop around WNY area and I make special trips just to get it."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-12-06,5,"Quiet and peaceful place.
If you want a nice coffee break you need to come here and taste every one of their brownies and donuts. And coffee of course ;) 
They also have some toys for kids and a super comfy couch. 
I love it."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-11-22,5,"This is my favorite weekend spot - the service, the healthy options on the menu, the, the ambience- everything is just great! Very warm hospitality!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-11-19,4,"We were running errands in the area and decided to check out the Parker. I had seen some great reviews here and knew I had to go check it out soon. 

Growing up in WNY there were barely an cute local coffee shops, at most we had Café Ole.. anyone? remember? Anyway, don't let the store front fool you this place is pretty spacious. It has a good amount of seating and a very welcoming ambience. There are some tables in front and a bench for seating. Then they have a middle room with a couch, two chairs and coffee table. There's a back room that is spacious with great seating and if I'm not mistaken I believe they do have an outdoors area? 

We both ordered cappuccinos that were made perfectly and order two donuts everything came out to $13 which I thought was a great deal. Their specialty donuts were pretty yummy. We hung out for a while on this Saturday afternoon and enjoyed our drinks. Staff was pretty friendly and inviting. Already texted a few local friends encouraging to check them out!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-11-17,3,"I'm surprised to see such positive reviews for this cafe - mine wasn't a 5-star experience and I'm usually quite generous with my ratings. It could have something to do with the timing of my visit - I walked in about 30 minutes before they close. The cashier, who also made the drinks, was not too thrilled to see customers walk in nor friendly. I decided to get the  chai latte and a beef empanada. The snacks are not home-made, so she just heated the empanada. I can say that I have never had a worse empanada - it had a weird egg-type smell and for some reason tasted a bit sweet. The  chai was okay, but I prefer the one at Starbucks. The space itself is cute in itself, I didn't get to try the backyard but on a good weather day it must be quite relaxing to order drinks while in the backyard! And they have a back room which is quite cosy. It is a nice, cosy spot to relax and they also offer free wifi. But my specific experience in terms of customer service or snacks was bad, and the drink wasn't great either."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-10-28,5,A Hidden Gem In  West New York. I Happen To Walk By This Place And I'm Glad I Walked In. Greeted With A Smile As Soon As I Walked Through The Door Ordered A Hot Chocolate As The Barista Was Making My Drink I Walked Around The Place. You Want A Home Away From Home This Place Is It. Regular Seating In The Front As You Walk Down The Place You Notice A Comfy Couch Where You And Company Can Have Some Alone Time Further Back There Is A Room Where Most People Were Studying And There Is A Door To Get To The Back Yard Where It's Also Amazing Oh Yeah And The Hot Chocolate Amazing. Came Back A Few More Times Already And Haven't Been Disappointed. Pumpkin Spice Latte Yeah That's Also Amazing. Hope The Neighborhood Comes To Appreciate This Hidden Gem
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-10-26,5,"Great atmosphere, amazing pastries. A must visit if you love coffee. Service was great and staff was extremely friendly."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-10-14,4,"I was looking for a café one day and I happened to stumble across Parker. It's on a nice little street with several cute shops. The guy working welcomed us with a smile and was very friendly. He made me a wonderful latte and my girlfriend a matcha tea. We both enjoyed or drinks in a nice little sitting area in the back, which was lined with books for our enjoyment. Great place!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-10-12,5,This place rocks! I was visiting from out of town and wanted to try a coffee shop. This place was so good and delivered great quality coffee and food. It is a must try!
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-10-05,5,"I found out about this place through Yelp! After being disappointed for the second time at ""The Chef Barn"" in Edgewater.

I automatically loved the vibes walking into the shop. Michael was the man in charge behind the counter. Very nice guy.

You can enjoy your coffee just about anywhere in this place. All the way from facing outside the window, by the counter, in the living room to the backyard! So so so nice!!

If I lived in the area I would literally spend my days here studying and reading all the time. Love it.

I had the macchiato which Michael was so nice to inform me that they served it the classical way which is great! And my sister had the Chai Laté which was very Yammy too! We both ordered a grilled cheese sandwich which was very cheeeeesssyyy! Can't have enough cheese! 

I deff fell in love with the place. I'll deff be coming back when I'm in the area.

Also, you can host events in the backyard. They have a little stage area you can use. It must look really nice at night time. 

Apple Pay is available!

Whoever the owner is. Good job!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-10-01,5,"There are a lot coffee shops out there.....

There is the large chain shop that cranks out specialty artisanal concoctions and require concentration to place your order. They get your name wrong and many times their coffee is burnt or over brewed. Its popular, crowded and finding a seat can be tough. The coffee isn't bad and it works when you need a boost. 
AKA Papa bear's hard bed.

Then there is the basic cup of Joe place that brews pot after pot of average coffee. It tends to be a bit weak and watery. The decor is average but the space is usually bright (and empty). Again, the coffee isn't bad and comes in handy when you want a light cup, plus it's t's affordable. AKA Mama bear's extra soft bed.

But then there's Parker. Great coffee that's truly made to order. Delicious flavor and they have wonderful combinations. Freshly brewed and hot. The staff is friendly and attentive. The decor is inviting and comfortable like your good bestie's living room. It's like Central Perk (from Friends) but more intimate. 

Go with a friend, a laptop, a good book or just your thoughts. Sip, sit and relax, no, luxuriate, in one of their coffee rooms or outside in the garden. And you can choose a chair, bench or couch!

And they have a great variety of organic teas and snacks like donuts, empanadas, sandwiches, cookies., etc. All made fresh daily and the options change rregularly from strawberry cheesecake donut or creamy spinach empanada to classic grilled cheese. 

Not a coffee house, a coffee boutique. 
A hidden gem and like Baby bear bed... it's just right!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-09-05,5,"PB&J donut was so tasty. Also devoured the dice of quiche and iced mocha that we ordered. All in all, Parker is a quiet, cozy cafe to enjoy a quick bite or coffee. There's more space if you head to the back of the location and bonus, the employees are very kind and friendly."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-09-04,5,"The Parker is a ""must visit"" cafe!!! The space is beautiful, there are little nooks where you can enjoy your coffee in silence or areas of the coffee house that you can find a conversation with locals.  The coffee and teas are excellent.  The vegan donuts are outstanding!!! They offer small sandwiches and light snacks. Visit the Parker when you are in West New York!!!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-08-22,5,The garden terrace in the back is a wonderful retreat. Coffee and baked goods are delicious.
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-08-13,5,"Friendly owner, great selection of drinks and food. Clean, spacious and bright. Perfect for sitting alone and reading a book or bringing friends along. They have an outdoor seating area as well, though at the time I went it was not yet open."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-08-10,5,It is the coolest breakfast place to eat and  they have free WiFi for my school work and I love the food and they also  have events that we can enter
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-08-07,5,Love this spot- came here with my boyfriend a month ago and loved the ham and cheese sandwich. The owner was so sweet and made the experience memorable. Can't wait until lunch time today so I can get it again!
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-08-05,1,"I salivated over looking over the yelp pictures of the donuts.   Finally was able to make it to the place only to find out there were no donuts.  When I asked when will there be donuts, I received major attitude from the worker that she doesn't know.  I left still having my pregnancy craving and a healthy dose of disappointment."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-07-27,5,"My boyfriend and I discovered this coffee shop right after moving to the area. The owner, Michael, is so nice and friendly, the coffee is amazing, and he makes a great turkey wrap :) love this place!!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-06-29,5,I am a huge coffee snob and this is by far the best coffee in the area! I always get an iced cappuccino w almond milk...perfect content of expresso and chilled foam..nice and creamy! The price is so reasonable as well! Definitely a must try and support your local shops!
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-06-23,5,Best coffee in West New York and neighborhood!
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-06-09,4,"Nice atmosphere, good coffee, convenient location. Delicious grilled cheese too!!  The staff is very friendly and genuine."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-05-20,5,"Amazing coffee and doughnuts. This modern, NYC-style coffee shop is a great addition to the neighborhood."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-05-10,5,"Very good coffee and great pastries. Place is well designed and cozy, little unexpected in the neighborhood but definitely a great find"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-05-10,5,"The BEST flat white i have had in a long time - over the top craft donuts, delicious - perfect size, I even bought some to take to my clients around the corner... first time visiting here in NJ, and won't be my last!  The owner works here and takes care of you personally. Five out of five star experience, food and drinks."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-05-08,5,"I have lived down the street for over 2 years and have been wanting a place just like this. Great vibes and amazing lattes . Also have been waiting for a fresh doughnut place, so glad I saw this place!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-04-14,5,"I spent all day here this Saturday! I had 2 matcha lattes, the plantain donut, and the mozzarella tomato sandwich. Incredible service, fresh taste, all prepared with the greatest amount of tender love and care. If you're looking for an experience on top of high-quality beverages and food, this is your place!

These two baristas today have easily become good friends of mine. They are incredibly hard working and genuine people with big hearts and open minds. I also spent the day meeting equally thoughtful and kind people that the owners attract and have filled my life with more quality people just by hanging out with them!

I highly recommend everyone to go and taste the magic, as I have for the entire day today!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-03-11,5,"A legit coffee spot in WNY! Yes, it's true. Pour overs, drip coffee, espresso drinks, and reasonably priced bites."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-03-10,5,"My go-to spot! Best coffee in town. Parker is the cutest spot in West New York. So happy this spot opened.  Try the donuts! Locally made, great flavors."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-03-08,5,"Finally a coffee shop in walking distance from me, thank you Parker for filling the void for an amazing coffee in our area. My husband and I have been about 4 times in the last couple weeks alone.The atmosphere is cozy and everyone is super friendly. The lattes are perfectly made. They also offer great food I definitely recommend the grilled cheese. And as if that isn't enough they offer these deliciously unique donuts, we have already tried 3 of the flavors, hubbys favorite is the pb&j one and mine is the dulce de leche. This is the perfect place to go and unwind with a great cup of coffee."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-03-04,5,"New favorite coffee spot! The employees are extremely friendly and always willing to offer up suggestions and descriptions of the pastries/drinks. Every drink I've tried has been amazing, and super fairly priced. The donuts are TO DIE FOR! I've already been twice in the past few days and plan on coming in more often! The decor of the store is super cute, contemporary, and welcoming. It's the perfect spot to bring a book or work, order a coffee, and get comfortable on the couch. Love!!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-03-04,5,Much needed cafe in the neighborhood with great coffee and pastries with a cozy and comfortable interior. Tried the peanut butter and jelly and dulce de leche donuts and both were amazing. Will definitely be back!
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-02-23,5,So amazing to finally have a place in our area that delivers incredible coffee with the Cozy feel of a Lower East Side Cafe on a rainy day. However the most amazing part isn't just The buttery croissants but the passion and heart that the owners of this fine establishment have for the community and helping families and Youth. Can't wait to return with my family and the students I teach in the area to see the amazing example that these owners have set for our community! As well as getting another perfectly made mocha latte and croissant
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-02-16,5,What an awesome little coffee shop in the area finally! Really good coffee selection and just the right amount of treats. Cute little space to enjoy your coffee while reading or doing some work.  Welcoming the new local joint!
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-02-12,5,"Favorite new coffee spot, the latte's are amazing.
Cute interior, free WiFi. Love this place, I'll definitely keep coming here. Will recommend to others to stop by here."
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-02-10,5,"If there was one thing missing in this area of West New York, then it was a quaint, cozy cafe with amazing coffee. The cappuccino and latte have both been excellent. Lovely interior with plenty of outlets and free wi-fi. Highly recommend it!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-02-08,5,"Favorite new coffee spot!!
Super cozy vibes and friendly staff. 
My cappuccino was on point and they have a great selection of local pastries"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-01-27,5,"What a gem...I was waiting for this cafe's opening for 4 months! And it finally opened and outperformed my expectations. Nice people, good coffee, delicious food, cute interior, Free WiFi & outlets. 

I and my husband had a pour over, a latte, the dolce de leche donut and the plantain donut. 

They have 4 kinds of beans for pour over including Decaf - we've got Ethiopian - it's smooth and easy to drink with tasty blueberry flavor. 
The latte has plenty of foam and right balance of bitterness and natural sweetness

HOMEMADE DONUTS.... MUST TRY!!!!
So creative - dolce de leche has pineapple on top and condense milk + pineapple cream inside. Their plantain donut has plantain mouse inside. Both are soooooo goood!!! I told them they deserve to charge more for their donuts! 
They also have guava cream cheese donut which has plenty of cream cheese inside covered by guava graze. Will try next time! 

Their pastries are from a local bakery and they have sandwiches too. Surprisingly reasonable prices. Def recommend!!!!!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-01-23,5,"New York in the west, New York. Only shop in the area to serve Brooklyn roasting coffee, nice pastries too !!"
247,parker-west-new-york-4,2018-01-18,4,"Enjoyed a great mocha latte, loved the atmosphere. I highly recommend this beutiful cafe!!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2020-03-07,5,Loved Da Capo.  Two perfect drinks.  Nuff said.  One was a Penicillin. The other a Corpse Reviver #2.  The guy behind the bar knows what he is doing.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2020-01-10,5,Really nice vibe on a Friday night for happy hour. Not overcrowded and good price drinks. Would go again.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-12-30,1,Once again ...they said they were changing the menus ...and of course they haven't ...The menu online is absolutely not the menu they have at this upper west side coffee shop ! The Worst hospitality mannerism as well . They say sorry ...and then dont change a THING!! really strange to me.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-12-30,1,"Sir.... I nor did my wife know that the menu was not the menu we saw on line prior to making the reservation or else we would of Never Made The reservation to begin with! The Menu given to us on that evening Was Completely Different than what you were portraying on line and far less appetizing..... Did I not explain it properly?
Your Hospitality is seriously lacking... All The Best To You!!!!!!!!!!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-12-30,4,See some space and terrific coffee drinks....the menu looks pretty good...although we did not have food...for a cool place to hang with friends...this place works
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-12-07,1,Its unfortunate that a wine bar does not know that you never serve a five-year-old Pinot Grigio. It practically tasted like diluted dish soap. Especially one that is not worth more than 14$ a bottle. The food wasn't too much better than this despicable understanding of wines either.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-10-31,4,"Lovely cafe/restaurant in the Upper West Side !

Love that they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

Food & Drinks
- Steak was very good - well priced. Mashed potatoes were a bit heavy. Roasted vegetables were very tasty.
- Chicken Milanese was very disappointing. Might have been cooked after a fish or something, as the taste was really confusing.
- Tiramisu - really good! A little bit expensive as it is a small portion.
- Cocktails: great selection. Loved the Pisco sour.

Service
Very pleasant and accommodating.

Atmosphere
From outside, it looks super small and narrow. But in reality, it is way bigger. They have  a lovely room in the back with antique mirrors, it feels like a retro Parisian Bistro. Great room except from the light, it is way too bright.
The front and the bar area are very cozy"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-10-17,1,"How the woman who was working today has a job is beyond me. After 10 minutes in a not terribly crowded place, I left. No menu, no water, no nothing. At one point she looked right at me. No hello, nothing. At one point, someone, a manager? returned and sat next to me. She asked him to bring up a couple of sandwiches. When he returned he asked if he should heat them up. No, she said, no one ordered them. They are just in case. Meanwhile, there I sat, until I didn't. Stay away, at least in afternoon."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-10-07,5,"Honestly really didn't know what to expect when i came here. You walk in and it just looks like a bar, but then there's a small room in the back with restaurant seating. It was intimate, the service was really great and attentive. We built a great report with our waiter and he eventually brought us the best tiramisu I've had on the UWS. It's made fresh weekly and when they run out, it's unavailable for that week. It's definitely worth the chase. Delicious."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-10-01,5,"This is by far my favorite coffee shop, and it also happens to be a bar and a restaurant. The chef is incredible. The workers are great. They also support emerging artists!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-09-15,1,"What is up with the 2 ladies that are behind the bar??? Worst attitude, worst service.... we didn't even get a chance to order. Avoid this place!!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-08-29,4,"It's a lovely bar to go to during the day and evening for coffee drinks, lunch or cocktails.     I just wish they would hire friendlier people.    We had a female bartender the other day who was so unfriendly.    She had tattoos all the way up the neck so it seemed like she was right off the set of Orange is the new Black but she wasn't acting - just authentic scary attitude.     When we asked for something she would occasionally slam it on the bar.     Anyway other than the occasional rude Bartender the food and drinks are usually of high quality and atmosphere is great."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-07-16,1,"Came here twice this month for coffee-- I was excited to find a cute little spot in the neighborhood. Sat at the counter but the barista did not acknowledge me for a good 5-10 min both times, so I left. Needless to say, I will not be going back."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-07-10,5,"Da Capo has become my favorite place to stop by  on my way to work. I had avoided it initially funny enough because of the seemingly dark lighting, but after checking it out, I've been going regularly.  It's quiet in the morning and super chill. I love it especially since it's nice to have a place in the chaotic New York City where you're welcomed every morning by your name, and you don't even have to say what you want if it's your usual. They've got you. I'm not a morning person, and they always know when I need a larger coffee or more espresso shots haha. I forgot my food once too (again, not a morning person), and the man working there that day ran after me to make sure I got my food. When you need to feel cared for on a groggy morning or really any morning, Da Capo has got you. Their coffee is my favorite so far on the UWS. I'm a creature of habit, so I haven't tried too much, but everything so far has been delicious. Thank you, Da Capo!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-07-06,1,"This place gets good reviews according to Yelp but I sat down at the bar and was entirely ignored by the barista for 5 minutes, with no end in sight. So I left and went to Black Press coffee right down the road and it's excellent--should have come here first."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-06-23,1,"The worst. Ordered 3 salads. It took 45 minutes and we had to remind them twice. We are sure they had been forgotten, but there was only one other table.  No apologies. They finally put a small mediocre salad in front of us. Took. A few reminders to get the check. All in all, horrible experience."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-06-21,5,"Wonderful , charming service !!  Stopped by on a Friday morning , only for a cup of hot tea, but I love the place !!   I liked the funky 70's music that was playing.   The presentation on the tea was cute and the bar itself has a great almost industrial feel to it.   Looking forward to coming back"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-06-12,4,"Great little café and cocktail bar a few blocks from The Beacon Theatre, where you can enjoy some quality drinks before a concert rather than paying $13+ for a domestic beer at the venue. From what I could tell, all of Da Capo's liquor is either top shelf or obscure. Either way, you're in for a treat! Two corpse revivers each later, my friend and I were feeling a bit peckish so we split their quattro formaggi pizza - which was tasty and crispy, though a bit too heavy on the oil. But honestly? Would definitely return for some casual drinks and to explore more of their food menu if I'm in the area again."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-05-31,4,"My reservation was for 10:15 pm to dine in. As we were seated a group of people in the dining hall was leaving, so we were the only people there.

Veal meatball
The meatball was amazing, but the tomato sauce was a little too salty :(

Gravlax salmon with mango
I liked the combination, but gravlax was so chewy! It was like chewing salmon gum :(

Cheeseburger 
Cooked to perfection! And potatoes in truffle oil are just heaven!

Filet mignon
Cooked to perfection, so soft, so fresh! Layered cheesy potatoes were just the thing to compliment the meat! 

Tiramisu 
I would come back to this restaurant just to have another cup of tiramisu! I eat this dessert at least once or twice a week and this place has the best one I had in the last few months! 

Warning! When you check in on Yelp, it says the restaurant will give you a complimentary dessert. When I showed it to the waitress she laughed and said it was old and they don't do it anymore. Umm ok. Then she came back and said that ""they"" ( I guess the manager) decided to give me 5$ off the bill. The dessert was 10$. Just keep it in mind. I wasn't making a reservation here to get this free dessert, but was very excited when I saw it after checking in, so to hear they don't honor it anymore was a little upsetting."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-05-31,1,"Very Authentic Expierence - Just like you're in Italy!


Edible paninis and beverage served with boldly rude service, just like the real thing! It's a great escape from New York, to walk in and be instantly transported to the greatest country in the world.

One minor suggestion- if next time, I could be pickpocketed while a man on a scooter whistles at women walking by, that would have added to the authenticity. Perhaps when the weather warms up.

And as they say- When in Rome, do as the Romans. Remember to respect their culture by not tipping."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-05-21,1,"Very bad service at the bar. Ordered a NZ sauvignon blanc, which they had run out of. Without asking first, the bartender poured and brought a glass of Vermentino, and I was charged for the Vermentino. Bartender refused to serve the table, which I saw was being served for others. Then was asked to move away from the bar because of a broken fridge ""can you move somewhere else!?""  Something off with this place."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-05-18,5,"This my favorite ""neighborhood"" restaurant which is unusual for the upper West side as there aren't many!  Although it is small, it has four sections, each one with a different mood. The window seat is cozy, the bar is friendly, the lounge is comfy and the dining section is classic.  
Craig, the owner, is extremely conscientious about the A+ quality of his food, coffee, and cocktails as well as the menu selection and presentation. An interesting mix of people can be found at the bar almost anytime of day or night... both young and old, neighborhood and tourist."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-05-12,1,"Horrible experience. Came here with my family to have brunch for Mother's Day and left annoyed and hungry. Tried to order coffee and was told coffee was going to take a long time because there were a lot of coffee orders in the front. I'm sorry, what? You're a cafe. You should be able to pour a simple cup of coffee. Needless to say, it never came. Bloody Mary's were watered down like they had been sitting on the bar for a while. Our food all arrived at different times, had to ask multiple times for things like silverware, omelettes were so small and all undercooked/wet in the middle. $17 for a half-cooked omelette. Waitress kept bringing dishes out and she didn't know what they were or what table they were for. As someone who's worked in the restaurant industry, this is absurd. We sat for an hour and a half before the last of our entrees came out. This place might be great to pop in for a coffee to go, but honestly I wouldn't bother, there are so many other places. Do yourself a favor, stay away"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-04-28,5,"Coffee at the bar or in a couple window tables. Restaurant seating in the back. Perfect for a little snack / espresso / cocktail; pre/post dinner drinks; great brunch menu! Attentive, thoughtful staff."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-04-27,5,"A great find! Absolutely amazing food! Good ambience, great wine. Music is mellow and groovy.
I recommend! Short rib and pasta is divine!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-04-07,5,I love this place. Open at 7am with breakfast selctions and full coffee bar. I met Eddio the barista and watch him work. I heard people saying: The best cappucino in town! They should call it: Da CapoCino! Dinner is great with a selection of very interesting cocktails. I like the one with basil. Great place to be day or night! Enjoy
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-03-19,5,"Love Da Capo! Living in the UWS - it's my go-to wine bar! Great selection of wine AND the food is really good too! It's very cozy, cute and romantic bar. Service is amazing. Never a disappointment :)"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-03-16,2,"Everyone has a certain level of basic expectation for restaurant quality food. Even if it's bar food. Entice my appetite a little, God. This was atrocious. I honestly cannot believe we paid 14$ for a Cesar salad which I could have made myself, and that would have been more appetizing than what we consumed! The penne vodka was el dente and the sauce tasted like it's from a bottle. The burger was their only saving grace. Do yourself a favor and cook for yourself before coming here. Can't speak for their drinks though, we didn't get any drinks which are supposed to be good."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-03-09,5,"What a perfect little gem! My husband and I were hungry after a day at the Museum of Natural History and we are so pleased that we chose this place! The atmospheres laid back and relaxing. The server, Nadi, was just lovely.
We ate in the dining room toward the back and it's was nice and cozy and semi private since we came fairly early in the evening. The music was nice and ambient and not too loud to impede conversation. 
The waitress was knowledgeable about the wine and the food and helped us make a great choice in the Super Tuscan to go with our meal. 

We started with the Eggplant Cake to share and it was the perfect thing to whet our appetites. The combo of flavors and textures was really interesting. The mango salsa that accompanied the cakes was nice and refreshing with the warm, fried eggplant. The fried kale garnish was super crispy and we ate everything on the plate! 

For our mains, my husband chose the Penne a la Vodka and it was really tasty. The pasta was slightly too al dente for us, but this might just be the way they do their al dente. I chose the Short Rib and it was melt in your mouth delicious. The scalloped potatoes on which my short rib sat were cooked perfectly and complemented the meat but didn't compete. The dish was rimmed with really nicely roasted veggies that finished it off perfectly. 

We ended our meal with an indulgence of Creme Brûlée and Tiramisu and we were not disappointed. We are pretty finicky about both as they are our favorite desserts, but their versions we so good!

This was a perfect night!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-02-21,4,"Da Capo has become one of my ""go to"" places on the Upper West Side.  It's my local bar and small plate food stop, as well as my afternoon café.  As a bar, they have a nice cocktail menu and people that know how to make a good cocktail.  They also have a nice bar menu from which my favorite item is the veal meatball, which is served with a red sauce along with some toasted bread and ricotta cheese.  Very nice!  I suggest you try it.  As a café, they have a nice coffee machine and offer espressos, Americanos, cappuccinos, etc... They also have an assortment of biscotti, cookies and other sweets to go with it.  

The bar is cool and they play good music.  There is a lounge area beyond the bar and another room for private events further in the back.

I recommend you check it out. :) Cheers!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-02-15,5,"I met a few friends here earlier this week; we had drinks at the bar, and while we only had a few beers, it is a great place to catch up.  The bartender was great and the ambiance, including the music is appealing.  They stop serving coffee fairly early, it was around 5:30pm when we got there; I recommend giving them a shot."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-02-13,1,"The bartender at this establishment, I unfortunately do not know her name, needs some serious training on customer service. I frequent this establishment a great deal. Usually in the morning for a nice cappucino. On this day several weeks ago I came in at just before 5pm to have an espresso and wait for my wife who was  meeting me for drinks.  I probably sat at the end of the bar for 10 minutes or more when the bartender finally came over. When I attempted to order an espresso she told me that it was after 5pm and that they were now a cocktail bar. Perfectly fine except that not only was I there before 5pm but there was a couple sitting at the bar drinking a tea and what appeared to be a cappucino.  The kicker,  the first cocktail on the menu has a shot of espresso in it. So it's not as if they couldn't make me one if they wanted. So I left. Upon reflection I called in to speak with the manager who was ""not there "". I left a message only to have no one return my call. So I called again and again had to leave a message. The manager finally called and left me a VM almost 2 weeks later. Which is why i'm writing this review and making my dissatisfaction with the way De Capo treats customers public. Why would I continue to give this place my business?"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-02-10,4,"Excellent service. Just had coffees. Americano and almond mild cappuccino were very good. Nice space. So happy Starbucks closed. Here we are!!

Came back for Sunday brunch. They just started brunch 3 weeks ago. Very nice small dining room at the back. Hidden. Attractive space. Having eggs Benedict, French toast, frittata.  Comment on the French toast was best ever. Eggs Benedict I had with salmon was classic and good. Frittata is not really that. Don't do it. Steak tartare outstanding. Good find!!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-02-01,4,"Very nice little cafe and a nice upscale alternative to the Starbucks up the block.  Good selection and seating.  The service could be a little faster and the espresso could be a little stronger, but they are very friendly."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2019-01-18,5,We hosted our work holiday dinner at Da Capo in December after a Hunt at the AMNH.  It was an outstanding experience!  We had approximately 30 people and the team at Da Capo were kind enough to give us the back room.  The food and cocktails were delicious and the service was top notch.  Many of my team members raved about the experience.  I think it's pretty obvious that I highly recommend Da Capo!
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-12-28,1,"I'm not one to usually right negative reviews, but I was really upset at the service I received this week. My mother, siblings and I had arrived to this establishment not to eat or drink rather to have cafe drinks. We decide to sit at the bar counter and ask the gentleman working for items from the menu. My mother asked for a large tea in which the mans response was something along the lines of the machine behind me was $35,000 and it doesn't do sizes it does shots. I then decided to ask for an iced chai latte and was told that it is a summer drink and two I don't have any of the powder. I'm aware that not all places have the chai powder, but I was fine with just a tea bag of chai being made with some milk so I asked if I can instead have it hot. After so much argument, he made it and it turned out terrible. 

Beyond treating us terribly, he was treating other patrons with the same level disrespect. There was a patron who's phone was with the volume on high, which may have been an accident, and the man decided to yell at him. There were also two patrons who came in and decided to go to the bathroom first and the server proceeded to tell them ""wow just use the bathroom and not buy anything.""


It's very unfortunate that this occurred because the restaurant's food and other menu items look good, but there was no respect given to patrons. I will never be back."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-11-19,5,Great coffee and cocktail menus with an amazing space! The service is beyond and would consider them for anything from a quick happy hour to an intimate private event.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-11-14,2,Food quality is ok. No bread served with the drinks or salad course. The fennel and arugula salad was very good and the highlight of the meal. The crab cakes were mini sized. The penne with vodka sauce was spicier than usual. I realized the next day that the waiter charged an extra drink to our bill. We won't be coming back.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-11-07,4,"never mad about a place that isnt crowded, has pizza and a happy hour that lasts until 8pm. i like the seats by the window so you can creepily glare at people as they innocently walk by. its a great little perch. i also like the bathrooms here. yall are lyin to yourselves if you dont think good bathrooms are important. word up - this place is dark so bring your maglite."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-10-28,5,Food and Service were excellent. The eggplant cake and tuna and salmon appetizers were top notch. The tuna and halibut entrees were also great. Wines were reasonably priced. Will definitely return.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-10-28,1,"Rude! Terrible customer service!  Barista clearly ignored us after walking past us several times and after waiting 15 mins to order, he decided to completely disregard me and my 300lb 6 foot Latino boyfriend. Utterly disgusted with this establishment."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-10-28,1,Worst customer service ever my girlfriend and I were waiting to order and the sever totally ignored us and took somebody else order that's just walked in after we were there waiting for 20mins.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-10-21,5,Have heard from many that the food is very good here. Decided to grab a bunch of friends and have a nice Sunday dinner. I must admit the drinks were very good (&strong). Had some eggplant cakes and the pizza might be one of the best I have had but truffle oil is good on anything. The espresso was delicious. I highly recommend!!!!
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-10-18,4,"Yelp led us to De Capo, while we were staying on the Upper West Side. The bar portion of the restaurant seemed very busy, while the dinning area we ate in was much more intimate and quiet. Our server was very good. We tried the giant meatball and a margarita pizza for appetizers. The giant meatball and the tomato sauce that covered it was excellent. We had ribs and French Chicken for our entree. Both of which were very flavorful and done to perfection. We would not hesitate to recommend or to stop at De Capo again."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-09-28,4,"At first time, we thought this place is more like a liquor bar, but we're impressed by the foods here -- so great.
The restaurant looks more like a local New Yorker's choice. We apparently looked like tourists and were worried not understand the menu. The waitress is so friendly and patient (and pretty!) when we had questions.
We enjoyed the food very much, especially the fish and the crab cakes!
I'd come back again next time when I visit nyc."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-09-10,5,"Great little espresso bar! We ate the lunch and it was delicious. $15 per lunch, otherwise $18 for a dinner plate. We ate te penne vodka and gnocchi bolognese. Other than that it's a small place to hang out drink some coffee/espresso/cappuccino or cocktails. I'll deff come back."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-08-27,1,"Not really familiar with the neighborhood we stumbled upon this place.  Great curb appeal, so we decided to check it out.  What a mistake, the bartender was rude.  Asked for a Manhattan, didn't know anything about the bourbons... and didn't have a cherry for the drink.  While it seems petty, it validated the rest of the night.  The place wasn't busy and now I kinda know why... while cool vibe from the outside, the inside vide was cold.  While, I don't write reviews often, I will for sure write a
Good one next time to a place and venue deserving.   Is it that hard to be nice to customers? I guess you can't fault the bartenders when there seemed to be a lack of management."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-08-26,4,The food was delicious and the waiter was very courteous. The desserts were also very good. Overall very good service.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-07-27,5,"Great food , had severos dishes the pasta  , the tuna, the kale salad is amazing. Lovely drinks"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-07-20,1,Very marginal. The bartender is very limited on the drinks he can make. Not a great selection on alcohol either. Definitely not worth a repeat. Not very friendly people there... disappointing.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-07-14,2,"West Side Location: 

The wine and drinks at this restaurant are just not good.  The bartender pours a very ""measured"" drink and they charge $15.  The wine was poor quality for the same price.  A margarita tasted like lemonade with very little tequila ($15).  I then ordered a bourbon.  They had a ""craft"" bottle that I never heard of before.  The pour was so small that I was able to finish it in 2 sips!! (also $15).  When I discussed this with the bar manager, a good guy, I was told that they have to precisely measure there liquor to maximize profit.   

I was with a party of four.  We had planned to eat dinner at Da Capo, but the bar experience caused us to go down the street to another place that poured good drinks."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-07-11,5,"Now this is a great neighborhood spot! I can highly recommend a great cappuccino, a ""brought me back to Italy (sigh)"" Sopressata sandwich (be patient, it's heated), an exceptional grilled cheese sandwich, happy to find Cantucci and cocktails! I normally don't eat out alone but did so at Da Capo's bar and felt really comfortable while enjoying a tasty late lunch. Love the music and the relaxing vibe making one feel very welcome."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-07-07,5,"What a great find!! Service was impeccable, as was the food!! The atmosphere was inviting and comfortable and not pretentious. Try the short rib or the tuna...both were spectacular! Attention to detail was top notch! Hope this place sticks around because it is a serious score for the UWS!! Thanks David for a great dinning experience!!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-06-30,5,Just had a wonderful dinner at Da Capo.  The service and food were excellent.  My husband had a pasta fagioli and we shared a delicious veal meatball as well as an arugula fennel salad with chicken.  The chocolate lava dessert was amazing!
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-06-23,5,"A rare gem. A+ on every level. I love the romantic decor right down to the crispy clean bathroom. The drinks and food are great. And there's always enough space to find a quiet corner with a laptop (day or night) even when the place gets rolling. The warm, welcoming hospitality of trained professionals like David have made this place feel like a neighborhood home. You will get courtesy and professionalism on every level no matter who you are or what you're looking for in a cafe/restaurant/bar. Super cool place, super great people for kids, dates, meetings, laptops--it's a huge, well designed place to accommodate all."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-06-21,5,"Went here for a light lunch/coffee after getting tickets for Shakespeare in the park. Absolutely loved it. 
I had a mocha latte and a grilled cheese sandwich. The mocha was perfect and exactly what I expected. The grilled cheese was superb. Buttery, cheese, the right amount of crisp. It was perfect and came with an excellent side salad. 
My friend had a sopressata panino which she absolutely adored. I had a bite of it and it was quite delicious. 
All in all, would absolutely come here again. Lovely place that was comfortable and delicious with friendly, attentive service."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-06-14,5,"Great place,  
Wonderful food, great hospitality and owner was super accommodating to us."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-06-04,5,"tl;dr - a really lovely place with great flavors and a wonderful menu. Vibe is really nice for a date night, price is pretty good considering location, and service was prompt. 

Da Capo exceeded both mine and my boyfriend's expectations in nearly all aspects. The restaurant opens up with a bar area in a somewhat long hallway with a more formal sitting area in the back. It wasn't crowded when we went (around 8 on a Monday). 

Gnocci - 8/10
Steak - 9/10
Tiramisu - 10/10 

My boyfriend ordered the steak and I ordered the gnocci. To preface, I've never had gnocci that I've enjoyed. To my delight, I really enjoyed my meal! Despite being literal balls of potato, they felt light and the sauce was hearty and rich. It was really filling and I took a little less than half home. My boyfriend got the steak - and for the size, the price was really good. To be fair, it wasn't the best cut of meat; there was a good amount of tendon and connective tissue. He ordered it medium rare, but because the meat was so thick, it was a little more rare in the middle. Keep that in mind if you're avoiding rare meat! The sauce was really delightful and light, and the potatoes were heavenly. It was a great, balanced dish and I will definitely order myself the steak next time.

The yelp check-in deal was amazing! Our server presented us with a tiramisu (to be fair, I was confused we didn't get to choose but it was a good surprise). The tiramisu was wonderfully light and had just the right balance of flavor. My boyfriend and I could have devoured three more despite eating a filling meal just minutes before. Definitely make sure to take advantage of this deal! Or otherwise just order the tiramisu, hehe."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-05-31,5,"Third time here!!! Great spot. Finally, some consistency. Highly recommend, for yummy cocktails and a delicious lunch and/or dinner. Friendly, neighborhood spot-smiling faces from the staff. Bravo!!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-05-23,5,"My experience at Da Campo was AMAZING, AWESOME, DAVID was FANTASTIC, PERSONABLE  AND ENGAGING. Margarita pizza and oysters were delicious!!!!! I would definately recommend that you stop by for the experience!!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-05-20,5,"Decided to eat here after the Museum. What a good decision.

My boyfriend and I shared the Crab cakes (yum), the Caprese salad, and Bolognese. Everything was very flavorful! 

Our server David was a delight to talk to and helped with suggestions when we couldn't decide between selections.

To our surprise, we got a delicious birthday treat when David overhead us talking about celebrating."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-05-12,1,"I live less then a block away from this bar and have visited about a dozen times, but my patience has absolutely worn out. I wish I could give it a better review because the cocktails can be pretty good, but unfortunately, I find most of the staff to be overwhelmingly inconsiderate of their guests needs if not outright rude.

It's not so much that they won't accommodate small requests, but they make you feel inferior for asking. My girlfriend has sensitive teeth and doesn't like overwhelmingly cold drinks. Can she get a drink with less ice? No. A shallower glass so it's easier to drink? That's not how it's designed to be served. God forbid, a straw? Absolutely not. The ""mixologist"" (yes, that is how they will refer to themselves when talking to you) want you to experience the ""aroma"" of the drink. The aromas aren't much good if you can't take a sip without wincing. 

Again, that might sound like a petty complaint, but it's the attitude you receive as well, as if it's your fault that you can't enjoy the drink exactly as they intended it. The reason we keep going back is because sometimes, the better bartenders will actually take your need into consideration. But this last visit was it for me. We went with a group of friends before dinner because it was convenient. Ordered drinks and my girlfriends cocktail came loaded with ice in a tall, skinny glass. Pretty much undrinkable for her. She asked for a straw and again, the server made it seem like she should be ashamed. She couldn't drink the drink at all and was too embarrassed to push the issue. I ended up chugging it and we left as fast as possible. I go out to enjoy myself, not to feel uncomfortable and embarrassed. This bar has no problem dismissing any concern you might have and seems to simply not care about whether you are enjoying yourself or not as long their ""vision"" is protected. 

It's sounds like a small thing, but like I said, it's how they make you feel about it. Not only will I never be back, but I will tell every one in the area to avoid this place. They do not deserve my money. Luckily, there are other great cocktail places in the area. If you are on the fence about where to have a nice drink, I'd ask that you walk a few blocks in any direction away from this establishment on principal alone."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-05-12,2,"So we had a  poor experience at DaCapo
1) the owners were drunk at the bar 
2) the pizza was soggy and raw 
3) the crab cakes were more like crap cakes dry and burnt 
4) The steak tartare was old and smelly
I do not know how an one can suggest this place"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-05-09,2,"Ok, I am going to be completely honest here. This has NOTHING to do with the VERY FRIENDLY bartender and PROMPT staff - This is a matter of quality.
We came here around 9:00 right when the kitchen wanted to close and the front of the house let us come into eat anyways. Maybe the kitchen was not happy about that or something, but the food was so mediocre that I felt like I could cook it at home. The beef tartare appetizer was tiny, and there was a weird foul metallic and sour pungent aftertaste that was extremely offputting to me.
Then I need to comment about how unsatisfying the wine was. $12-13 for a glass of coyingly sweet screwcap Tuscan, or a watery acidic red is just too much - I mean the bottles themselves would probably go for $15 - That's how cheap it tasted!
I've paid $50-60 for a much higher quality meal in many other Italian restaurants. If I paid $25 for my meal, I would've thought the price made sense for the quality. I really hate writing negative reviews, but have to be super honest as a foodie in NYC!!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-05-08,3,Sadly unimpressed - we did come in late-ish on a weeknight but the wine was very cheap quality for the price and the food was just ok. We ordered the filet mignon tartare and the meat seemed a little off and the bread too hard + garlicky. I had the tortellini  as a main and the goat cheese was overpowering while the green beans were sparse. I am guessing from the other reviews that this place is just better during the day. My recommendation - don't go after 9.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-04-29,4,"Great coffee, good brunch (just one small comment, too much oil on sautéed spinach)"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-04-26,5,"We've had dinner at Da Capo twice and found the food to be excellent.
The room is pretty and feels quite European, and the service was very good both times.  It has not yet been discovered and is really has some of the best food on the Upper West Side.  The menu is creative and sophisticated.
The only downside is that when the room is full and if there's a noisy party it can get loud, but the place is so great that this should not keep people away."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-04-20,5,"Great addition to the neighborhood! Attentive staff, inventive cocktails, and yummy dishes!!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-04-09,4,"I joined friends for drinks and dinner a few weeks ago. Luckily it wasn't  crowded so the din was minimal. There seems to be a nice comraderie between the bartenders and the patrons.  I ordered the beef bone marrow appetizer and while the 30 minute wait (or so it seemed) and the one bone didn't appeal to me, the taste did.  In fact it was so good, I asked that they give me more than the sliver of bread that i got initially so I could sponge up the juices. 
For the dinner we left the bar area and went to the back dinner area. I liked the informal,laid back environs but my concerns over a similar nondescript food were not realized.  I ordered the short ribs which were the best short ribs I ever tasted. Imagine a piece of beef with a consistency of jello, so soft and wobbly.  (I did not see this dish on the internet menu; maybe it was a special).  And so delectable. My companions were happy with their fish dishes. 
I hope da capo is successful. We need a neighborhood bar with great food."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-04-06,5,"Very accommodating and a cozy restaurant where they make the best of a small space. Menu is great, many options. We had the special linguine which was delicious and lobster pizza. Yum. 
This was our second visit and I will be going back."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-03-25,5,"It's a cute little gem, cute and cozy. The back area is lovely. The coffee is great, and their sandwiches are very fresh made."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-03-21,5,"I didn't realize this place was also a full out restaurant because I've only been in the front part to have coffee/tea and a croissant, but I'm giving it 5 stars anyway because I LOVE it. I'm temporarily really close to it and will be totally depressed to not have a little coffee shop to do work in when I move farther away at the end of the week. The croissants are hecking delicious and the vibe  is comfy and cool."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-03-17,5,"This places is as beautiful and delicious as it looks on its website/yelp page! The service was also exceptional! I had both the crab and the eggplant and my friend had the beet salad, all were to die for! Complex flavors delicately done  coffee was also delightful! I will definitely come back!!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-03-16,3,"Given all of the great reviews, I'm inclined to think that maybe I came on an off night. We came for dinner on a Friday night and the food was just ok. I ordered the filet mignon medium rare. It came back completely well done, so much so that it looked like pot roast. My friend got the pasta bolognese. The menu did not indicate what kind of pasta it was but it ended up being gnocchi (not a problem but just odd that the menu wouldn't note that). He said the sauce tasted almost like it came from a jar. 

Other than that, the service was good and the place was cute. A lot of reviews mention that the drinks are good (we only had wine) so I'll go back and give their drinks a try but the food for dinner was not great at all. Sad to post a negative review but hopefully it will help them to have constructive criticism."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-03-15,5,"Charming little gem. This was a coffee bar but has evolved into a great new dinner spot noted to be one of the newest best kept up n coming secrets in NYC. The renowned cordon bleu chef Andrew Swersky has a remarkable backstory. Accolades the likes of executive chef of the famous Forge in Miami Beach for 10 yrs, owner of the Morada Cafe and Boulevard Grille in Boca Raton. The food at Da Capo is incredible to say the least. Chef Andrew is inventive and excited about every meal served. This chef has had some  of NYCs most noted chefs work under his tutelage  As far as the menu, the Fois gras is beyond delicious and his lamb chops are incredible. Let's not discount the Caesar salad to do any meal justice. Great easy going atmosphere but get in ASAP because with food of this caliber it is without question going to be difficult to get a table.... Do note, if the duck is on the special list it's a must have!! We enjoyed this new spot early on and anticipate coming back often to see Da Capo explode on the food scene. It was so incredibly good we did our due diligence as noted on the chef. It's a pleasure to experience food at this level in such a comfortable environment sans any airs etccc"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-03-15,5,"Rocks!  Go to neighborhood hang out place.  Coffee during day, penicillin in the night - who can complain"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-03-08,4,"Da Capo is a lovely cafe and it's a great addition to the neighborhood. The latte is delicious and it's my favorite in NY. I also love the cookies (they actually get the dough from Italy!) and the sandwiches and cakes are also tasty.  Unfortunately, I must admit that sometimes the service is hit or miss, with one of the employees being blatantly rude/unfriendly. His attitude has definitely deterred me from going, but the past several (8-10 times), I've only had good experiences."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-02-17,5,The food and cocktails are excellent!! Definitely a new favorite for daytime or night
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-02-17,5,"The cocktails here are amazing! The bartenders really know their mixology and have a passion for it. I tried a mezcal drink, an old fashioned and then he made me a cocktail with rosemary that was delicious too! The pizza was good, but tiny. Also has the eggplant cakes...again good, but tiny food."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-02-11,5,"I've been OBSESSED with the creative cocktail list at this new Upper West Side spot. When I recommended to my husband to try the restaurant in the back of the bar, we were pleasantly surprised. We both had an appetizer and a main and everything was BEYOND. Never heard of eggplant cake but tried  it and it was unlike any eggplant dish I ever had. The beet salad was plated beautifully and was yummy. I can't stop thinking about the gnocchi bolognese. They were the fluffiest and lightest I ever had. (They would even rival any restaurant in Italy). My husband had the the tuna which was also delicious. Finally a place for great cocktails and sensational food right in the heart of the UWS!!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-02-02,5,"Walking down Columbus Ave, this restaurant caught my eye. I decided to give it a try and was blown away by the quality of service and food. The atmosphere was super intimate and romantic and the bartender greeted me right away and asked if I'd like to join them for dinner. My waiter, Jeff, was incredibly attentive and friendly and gave me great recommendations on food. I got the ""3D tomato soup"" which was absolutely beautiful. Different vegetables thinly sliced laid inside the bowl with a parmesan crisp perfectly balanced on top. The waiter then poured the soup inside the 3D formation and it was absolutely delicious. For my entree I ordered the ""Frenched Chicken Breast"" which was perfectly cooked and marinated with lemongrass and ginger. While eating, Chef Andrew came up to greet me personally and to thank me for coming in. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for excellent food and service!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-02-01,5,"WOW!!!! just dined my first time at Da Capo. What a marvelous experience.  The atmosphere is perfect for dinner and the bar features an excellent variety of unique signatue cockktails.  I enjoyed the "" Night We Met"" , an interesting alternative to your regular manhattan. The service and food are outstanding.  Our server David was very personable and attentive. We really enjoyed chatting with him. But, the most important thing is the food and the food is wonderful. My wife and I shared the salmon appetizer, which was delicious.  My wife enjoyed the evening 's dinner special,which was DUCK. The duck was excellently prepared and was thoroughly enjoyed. It was cooked to perfection, moist and very tasty.  I enjoyed the baked Alaskan halibut. It was equally well prepared and delicious. We enjoyed our visit to our table by Chef Andrew. His genuine desire to know if we enjoyed our food was greatly appreciated and very consisted with the attentiveness of the entire staff. I plan to regularly enjoy this Columbus Avenue gem. Hats off to Craig, Andrew and David."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-02-01,5,Randomly ran into this place while walking down Columbus. It's a really chill space with great music selection. The real winning factor of this place is that it's a coffee shop that uses real mugs! #winner!
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-01-31,5,"We had such a lovely dinner here for my birthday! What a cozy and sophisticated spot, with a menu too hard to choose from since all the dishes looked amazing! 

We ordered a spectacular beef tartare, fresh and zingy kale/romaine salad, and house made pillowy gnocchi bolognese, all delicious. The chef is inventive and the meal was perfectly paced. Friendly staff and attentive service.

Plus seasonal cocktails to boot and tasty red wine, we couldn't have been happier! Best new spot on the UWS hands down!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-01-27,1,"We were seated and waited for 20 min. No sign of the waiters, nobody cared about us, while the restaurant was half empty. We left and aren't coming back."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-01-25,4,"As the other reviews stated this place is perfect! Tiny, cosy, marble topped tables, artisanal salads, tiny cookies and they serve coffees, teas and a very tasty red wine Zabu Nero D'Avola. 
If you are tired of looking at dinosaurs and whales at the Natural History Museum, this place is excellent for recuperation!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-01-17,5,I just had the crab cakes. And they were the best crab cakes I've ever had. Amazing. It also has good ambiance and the chef personally came out to ask how our meal was. The staff was nice.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-01-15,4,"I've visited Da Capo a few times for cocktails and a few times for coffee, and I am excited to have this new addition to the neighborhood. Was bummed to learn that the wifi does not work, as this could have been a great spot for work from home days. Hopefully this will get fixed soon. We visited once for dinner with friends and greatly enjoyed the bolognese, the lamb, the tuna and the short ribs. We even had a personal visit from the chef. The only complaint is the foie gras - about 15 dollars over priced and tasted like it had just been taken out of the freezer. Otherwise, we will be back!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-01-14,5,Great addition to the UWS.  Excited that they are expanding their food menu.  Everything has been delish so far.
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-01-13,5,This is a new go to place on the Upper Westside . It's one of those Gastropubs that this neighborhood needed ! The pasta is fresh and i love the meatballs! Can't wait to try other entrees on this menu ;)
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-01-08,3,"My glass of brewed coffee tasted inferior (reminiscent of weak gas station coffee) and it wasn't hot enough.  The two teeny tiny cookies were mediocre.  The seats at the bar are metal, minimally comfortable, and have no padding.  Aaaaand, when I asked for wifi, I was told it's TWC service and I have to sign up for a trial, and it may not be working well.  With the help of one of the servers, it became clear that it's non-functional.  C'mon!  

Also... The bathroom sign says ""restrooms"" (plural), even though it's only one (tiny) restroom.  And, on the menu it says, "" Meet ball slider"".  Really?  I hope that's a known mistake and it's left as a joke, as the other server suggested may be the case.  

For a place that seems to take itself very seriously, they should up their game, at the very least where the coffee and wifi are concerned."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-01-07,5,"Da Capo is the perfect, relaxed coffee shop / bar / restaurant that the Upper West Side has been missing. Mornings are relaxed with great coffee and better service. I haven't been here for dinner but hear great things. 

I enjoy stopping by for coffee every chance I can. This place is excellent."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2018-01-05,2,"Definitely a cool hole in the wall restaurant but it took 45 minutes to get a simple flat bread pizza. I saw it coming out and then before it got to our table, it was sent back because they forgot the meat. There was some unnecessary employee drama that occurred a few seats down from us and I just felt that personal conversation should have been taken somewhere else. At the end of it all, our server accidentally charged me someone else's $70 tab (when our bill was $25). Will not be returning."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2017-12-29,4,Craig owner is so friendly and caring for his staff and patrons.  Food is great and love the small plate sizes.  Coffee is excellent
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2017-12-29,5,"What a wonderful surprise! After a long morning at the museum, we were all starving and couldn't face the museum cafes. We went exploring and were drawn into Da Capo. The pizzas and sandwiches were wonderful and the service was great. Kids got hot chocolate and I had a spectacular glass of wine!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2017-12-21,4,"Came for drinks on a Wednesday night on a date and the place is very cozy. The owner was very nice, and the cocktails were incredible- one of the cocktails I had taste like apple pie and I loved It! I am definitely coming back to try food food. 

My only complaint is that the bartender was flirting with a girl the whole time and took a while to make the drinks....not good etiquette at all. Other than that- lovely experience."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2017-12-20,5,"Best new restaurant on the upper west side!! Great food, wonderful staff , great ambience and terrific value .. portions were very generous. We were a group of 8 so there were a lot of things ordered and everything was delicious ... from the salads to the short rib that literally fell apart it was so tender , to the pizzas ... and the veal meatballs were out of this world... check it out you won't be disappointed !!"
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2017-12-15,5,This place rocks! Great service and The bartender could not have been nicer. A top-notch operation all the way around. Highly recommended!
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2017-12-14,5,"Great atmosphere, best coffee in town.  Went back later in the week to meet friends at night and enjoyed a few drinks."
248,da-capo-columbus-new-york,2017-12-11,5,"Let's be frank. My friends and I fancy ourselves gnocchi connoisseurs, so when it appeared on the Da Capo menu, we didn't hesitate. I am delighted to report: Chef Andrew amazed us with perhaps THE freshest, most perfectly formed and delightfully bite-sized potato nuggets. The meat sauce was equally masterful. Even took the hubby his own order to go. It was that good. Must add that the back room is perfect for gatherings and even Tango dance meet ups!"
249,easy-victor-cafe-new-york,2019-11-16,4,"Lovely little place with great espresso, nice staff and good atmosphere. Sadly they ran out of chocolate croissants by the time we got there but I hope next time I'll get the chance to try it."
249,easy-victor-cafe-new-york,2019-10-08,5,Hidden gem. Had the cappuccino which was delicious and the chocolate croissant was filled with chocolate ganache - so good
249,easy-victor-cafe-new-york,2019-10-06,5,"Chic cafe with interesting menu items. I ordered the egg, bacon, and cheese on a Japanese milk bun. The sandwich was well crafted and looked very appealing. It tasted quite good, if just a little too salty. Really liked the ambience and background music too - felt kind of like a modern hotel lounge."
249,easy-victor-cafe-new-york,2019-09-09,5,"Beautiful cafe that occupies the front space of Legacy Records in Hudson Yards. Coffee is nice though nothing exceptional. The pastries though were great and surprisingly baked in house (most coffee shops can't be bothered with making their own croissants, but I guess what's the use of popping up in a high end restaurant when you can't borrow a few pairs of baking hands). The croissant is buttery, flaky and satisfying despite the small size. Plenty of seating by NY standards and there's free wifi for those who want to get some work done."
249,easy-victor-cafe-new-york,2019-08-16,5,"absolutely shocking discovery, just waking through and found best chocolate croissants and yogurt i ever tried. amazing, i can't wright long enough review about this place but chocolate croissants are fantastic..."
249,easy-victor-cafe-new-york,2019-04-28,5,"I don't want to review this place because I want it to remain the area's best hidden gem. The best coffee in the area with the nicest and most relaxing decor. Haven't had the brunch at Legacy Records, but it is supposed to be awesome."
249,easy-victor-cafe-new-york,2019-01-21,5,"Beautiful and quiet place to work. Extremely spacious and friendly staff. Only downside is that since this place turns into a restaurant at night, it can be a bit distracting when there are restaurant workers and managers setting up for dinner service."
249,easy-victor-cafe-new-york,2018-09-11,5,"I popped in here while out for a walk early one morning.  I was poking my head in the window, wondering what was going on in this new building and their restaurant space on the street level.

The owner saw me gawking and smiled, waving me in.  As I walked away, he came out, said hello and asked if I wanted coffee.  Shocked by how friendly and welcoming the guy was, given the often surly melancholy of the usual barista types, I stepped on in.  

Easy Victor is inside the Legacy Records restaurant in the new Henry Hall building, just west of 10th Ave on West 38th street.  It is about an avenue block from the Javits Center, so it would definitely be a nice break for convention goers.

I loved the luxe art deco Legacy Records space and Easy Victor is in the front part of the restaurant by the front window.  I ordered an espresso.  It was served in a very nice cup (see pictures).  The espresso was perfect. Very well made and the right very-warm-but-not-hot temperature.  

I will definitely be back."
249,easy-victor-cafe-new-york,2018-09-08,5,"We wouldn't go anywhere else for coffee after trying Easy Victor! Hands down the best we've had in NY. Amazing ambience & decor...and we absolutely love all the baristas  We'll let the pastries speak for themselves, we describe them as a taste of heaven!"
249,easy-victor-cafe-new-york,2018-07-03,5,"Best place to sit and enjoy. Good chill music. Great coffee. Stunning decor. Full bar across the floor at Legacy Records.
Cannot stress how great this place is. Stop by if you're visiting the Javits Center!"
