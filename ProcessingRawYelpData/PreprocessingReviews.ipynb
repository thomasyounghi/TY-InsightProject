Strawberry was always my favorite cream cheese growing up and I haven't ever been able to find since going vegan! \\n\\nGot a plain bagel w/ the tofu strawberry cream cheese. It was a little pricey ~$6 but not bad and it was delicious. \\n\\nAlmost all of their bagels are vegan and they also had a plain and veggie tofu cream cheese.\\n\\nOnly disappointment is that they won't allow you to use your own Tupperware instead of the paper they use to wrap the bagel - wish they would so that those who wanted to could help reduce waste \\n\\nOverall amazing though and I'll definitely be back!    1\n",

Brought my friend here last time and she absolutely loved it. They also have a wide selection of syrups and milk selections. They also have bakery items like croissants and also menu food items for a quick brunch. Although the line is sometimes long especially in the morning, it moves pretty fast and you get what you pay for. They also have a stamp card, so after around 10 drinks you can qualify for a free drink!\n"
